  <h1>Groves</h1>
  <p class="landing-subtitle">Curated clusters of related ideas — pathways through a theme.</p>
</header>

<p>A <strong>grove</strong> gathers related evergreen and plant notes into a coherent pathway. Each grove explores a theme from multiple angles, helping you see how ideas connect. They're the best place to start if you want to understand how I think about a topic.</p>

<div class="grove-cards">

      <span class="grove-card-icon">🪴</span>
      <span class="grove-card-title">{% if note.data.title %}{{ note.data.title }}{% else %}{{ note.fileSlug }}{% endif %}</span>
