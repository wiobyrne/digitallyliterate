# Emotional Intelligence

*The infrastructure for human flourishing*

> Emotional intelligence is not a soft skill. It's the foundational capacity that makes everything else — teaching, organizing, leading, collaborating — actually work.

---

## What This Is

This Grove gathers concepts, practices, and frameworks for working with emotional intelligence across individual, interpersonal, and organizational levels. The through-line: creating conditions where people can bring their full selves to work, learning, and community.

This goes beyond "self-awareness" into the design of systems, workflows, and cultures that honor human complexity.
