# Internet Culture

*How digital spaces shape who we become*

> Internet culture is not a niche interest. It's the water we swim in — the norms, practices, and power dynamics that shape identity, discourse, and democracy in the 21st century.

---

## What This Is

This Grove gathers frameworks for understanding how digital platforms shape human behavior, identity formation, and social dynamics. The focus isn't technology for its own sake — it's about recognizing the cultural patterns that emerge when human interaction is mediated by algorithms, architectures, and incentive structures.

Understanding internet culture is a literacy skill. Without it, educators can't teach media literacy, organizers can't navigate platform dynamics, and researchers can't study digital life honestly.
