# Group Architecture & Trust

*How the shape of a group affects the safety of its members*

> The structure of your digital spaces — who's in them, what they're for, and how they're governed — is itself a form of protection.

---

## Size Shapes Safety

A group chat with five people behaves differently from one with fifty. This isn't just about noise — it's about risk.

In a small group, everyone knows who's present. Information stays within a context people can track. When someone shares something sensitive, they can reasonably anticipate who will see it. In a large group, that visibility disappears. Messages reach people you may not know well. Screenshots travel. Context collapses.

**This isn't a reason to avoid large groups.** It's a reason to be intentional about what goes where.

| Group Size | Best For | Risk Level |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| 2–5 people | Sensitive coordination, personal support | Low — everyone knows everyone |
| 6–15 people | Working groups, project teams | Moderate — norms become important |
| 16–50 people | Community announcements, broad coordination | Higher — assume anything shared is semi-public |
| 50+ people | Public information, general updates | Treat as public by default |

A practical rule: **the larger the group, the less sensitive the content should be.**

## Purpose-Bound Communication

Every digital space works better when it has a clear purpose. A group chat that starts as a project coordination space and gradually becomes a place for news links, personal updates, and urgent alerts loses its usefulness — and its safety.

**Purpose-bound communication** means each space has a defined reason for existing:
- This channel is for scheduling
- This group is for sensitive family coordination
- This chat is for general community updates

When purposes blur, people share things in the wrong context. A parent shares a child's medical information in a channel meant for event planning. A teacher posts a student concern in a staff-wide thread instead of a small team chat.

**Clarity prevents accidents.** It's not about rigid rules — it's about everyone understanding what a space is for.

## Shared Norms as Group Infrastructure

The most effective digital groups have simple, explicit agreements about how they operate. These don't need to be formal documents. They can be as simple as:

- **We don't screenshot private conversations.**
- **We ask before adding someone new to a group.**
- **We use this channel for X and that channel for Y.**
- **We check in before sharing information outside this space.**

These norms work best when they're discussed openly, not imposed. A school team that collaboratively decides "we'll keep student names out of the main chat" will follow that norm more consistently than one where it's announced as a rule from administration.

**Example:** A community organization creates three Signal groups — one for the leadership team (5 people), one for active volunteers (20 people), and one for general announcements (100+ people). Each group has a one-line description pinned at the top explaining what belongs there. New members are told about the structure when they join.

## Building Trust Through Transparency

Trust in digital spaces isn't built by vetting people or testing loyalty. It's built through consistent, transparent behavior over time.

**What builds trust:**
- Being clear about who has access to what
- Explaining decisions, not just announcing them
- Following through on stated norms
- Admitting mistakes openly when information is shared inappropriately

**What erodes trust:**
- Adding people to groups without explaining the context
- Sharing information from private conversations without consent
- Changing access or permissions without notice
- Treating questions about norms as signs of disloyalty

For educators, this maps directly to how we think about classroom culture. The same principles that make a classroom feel safe — clarity, consistency, respect, transparency — make digital spaces feel safe too.

## A Simple Framework for Any Group

When setting up or evaluating a digital space, ask:

1. **Who is here?** Does everyone in this space need to be here?
2. **What is this for?** Can we state the purpose in one sentence?
3. **What belongs here?** What kinds of information are appropriate for this space?
4. **What doesn't?** What should go somewhere else?
5. **How do we add people?** Is there a shared understanding about invitations?

These five questions prevent most of the problems that cause harm in group digital spaces.
