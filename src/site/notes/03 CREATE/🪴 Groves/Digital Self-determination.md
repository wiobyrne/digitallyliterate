# Digital Self-determination

*Take Back Your Digital Life*

> A community guide to privacy, sovereignty, and resilience in the digital age.

---

## What is Digital Self-determination?

Digital self-determination is the right of individuals and communities to decide how their data, identity, and participation are governed in the digital world. It's rooted in political philosophy and collective rights, emphasizing **agency + context + power structures**.

This isn't just about what tools you use — it's about **who controls the systems you're embedded in**.

**Examples in practice:**
- Indigenous data governance movements (e.g. OCAP® principles)
- Digital sovereignty debates (EU, Global South)
- Community-run platforms and protocols (Mastodon, Solid, Matrix)

---

## Why This Matters

**"If a product is free, you are the product."**

In exchange for the convenience of free apps and platforms, we often trade away our privacy and personal data. Tech giants collect our photos, chats, and browsing habits — then quietly harvest and exploit this information for profit.

This isn't abstract policy. It affects ordinary people:
- Targeted ads following us everywhere
- Sensitive information potentially leaking
- Communities having little control over online spaces

## The Three Pillars

Digital self-determination rests on three interconnected ideas:

### [[03 CREATE/🪴 Groves/Privacy by Design\|Privacy by Design]] 🪴
Tools and services built to **protect your privacy by default**, so you don't have to be an expert to stay safe. The tool itself does the privacy work.

### [[03 CREATE/🪴 Groves/Digital Sovereignty\|Digital Sovereignty]] 🌿
**Owning and controlling your digital information** and infrastructure. You decide where your data lives and who can access it.

### [[03 CREATE/🪴 Groves/Digital Resilience\|Digital Resilience]] 🌿
The skills and habits to **stay safe and strong online**, even when technology or threats change. Building capacity, not dependency.

**Security Culture** (practice layer) — How communities enact privacy, sovereignty, and resilience together through shared norms. See [[03 CREATE/🪴 Groves/Security Culture as Digital Literacy\|Security Culture as Digital Literacy]].

## Core Questions

- What does it mean to have agency in digital spaces?
- How do we balance convenience with control?
- What skills and knowledge enable digital self-determination?
- How can tool choices become opportunities for learning?

## The Toolkit

Practical tools for taking back control:

| Need | Privacy-First Solution | Why It Protects You |
|------|------------------------|---------------------|
| Messaging | [[Signal\|Signal]], [[Session\|Session]] | End-to-end encryption by default |
| Documents | [[CryptPad\|CryptPad]] | Zero-knowledge — even servers can't read your docs |
| Community Chat | [[Matrix\|Matrix]]/Element | Encrypted + community-controlled servers |
| File Storage | [[Nextcloud\|Nextcloud]] | Your data, your servers, your rules |

## Getting Started

**For Individuals:**
1. Start with one tool swap (Signal for texting is easiest)
2. Understand the "why" before the "how"
3. Build habits gradually — this is a practice, not a destination

**For Communities:**
1. Identify privacy champions who can learn deeply and support others
2. Run old and new systems in parallel during transitions
3. Frame tool changes as learning opportunities, not technical burdens
4. Make decisions together — cooperative governance strengthens adoption
