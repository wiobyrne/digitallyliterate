# Threat Modeling for Communities

*Simple questions that help groups think about what they're protecting*

> Threat modeling for communities isn't about imagining worst-case scenarios. It's about asking honest questions so you can make thoughtful choices.

## What Is Threat Modeling?

At its simplest, threat modeling is asking: **What are we trying to protect, and from what?**

For individuals, this might mean thinking about passwords and personal data. For communities — schools, families, nonprofits, faith organizations, neighborhood groups — it means thinking about the **people and relationships** that could be affected by how we use digital tools.

This isn't technical work. It's reflective work. It doesn't require special expertise. It requires honesty and a willingness to think about uncomfortable questions calmly.

## The Five Questions

Any community can work through these questions together. They don't need to be answered perfectly — the value is in the conversation.

### 1. What are we protecting?

Start concrete. Not "our privacy" in the abstract, but specific things:
- Student records and family information
- Internal planning conversations
- Member contact lists
- Financial information
- Personal stories shared in confidence

**Example:** A school PTA might identify three things: the student directory, parent volunteer contact information, and the group chat where families sometimes discuss individual children's needs.

### 2. Who might want access to this?

This isn't about identifying enemies. It's about being realistic about who might encounter your information, intentionally or accidentally:
- Data brokers who scrape public information
- Former members who still have access to shared spaces
- Platform companies that mine data for advertising
- People outside the community who find shared content through search
- Bad actors who target organizations like yours

**Example:** A nonprofit working with vulnerable families might recognize that their client communications could be sought through public records requests, subpoenas, or data breaches at the platforms they use.

### 3. What would happen if this information were exposed?

Not every piece of information carries the same risk. Thinking about consequences helps prioritize:

| Information | If Exposed |
|------------|-----------|
| Meeting schedule | Minor inconvenience |
| Member contact list | Spam, unwanted contact |
| Student behavioral notes | Harm to student dignity, legal liability |
| Internal disagreements | Community trust damage |
| Immigration status of families | Serious safety risk |

**The exercise of ranking these honestly is itself valuable.** It helps groups understand that not everything requires the same level of protection.

### 4. What are we already doing?

Most communities already have some protections in place, even if they don't think of them that way:
- Password-protected accounts
- Private group settings on messaging apps
- Verbal agreements about confidentiality
- Limited sharing of certain documents

Acknowledging what already works prevents the feeling that everything needs to change. Often, the answer is "we're doing most things well — there are just two or three gaps."

### 5. What's one thing we could improve?

This is the most important question because it leads to action. Not ten things. One thing.

- Could we move sensitive conversations to an encrypted channel?
- Should we audit who still has access to shared drives?
- Would it help to set up disappearing messages for coordination chats?
- Do we need a simple agreement about what's okay to share outside this group?

**One improvement, adopted consistently, is worth more than a comprehensive plan that nobody follows.**

## Applying This in Different Contexts

### Schools and Educators
- What student data flows through unofficial channels (personal phones, group chats)?
- Who has access to shared drives with student information?
- Are communication tools chosen for convenience or for appropriateness?
- What happens to digital records when a staff member leaves?

### Families
- What information about our children is publicly accessible?
- Who has access to our shared photo albums and family group chats?
- If someone lost their phone, what family information would be exposed?
- Are we comfortable with what schools, apps, and platforms know about our kids?

### Nonprofits and Community Organizations
- What member information do we collect, and do we still need all of it?
- Who has administrative access to our digital tools, and is that list current?
- If a platform we use shut down tomorrow, what would we lose?
- Are our most sensitive conversations happening on appropriate channels?

## What This Is Not

This isn't about achieving perfect security. It's not about imagining elaborate scenarios. It's not about fear.

It's a **planning mindset** — the same kind of thinking that goes into fire drills, first aid kits, and emergency contact lists. We don't practice fire drills because we expect a fire. We practice because being prepared is a form of care.

Threat modeling for communities is the digital equivalent: thinking ahead so that when something does go wrong, the harm is smaller and the response is clearer.
