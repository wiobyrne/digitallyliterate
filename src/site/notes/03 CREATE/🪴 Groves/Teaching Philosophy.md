# Teaching Philosophy

*Education is liberation practice, not content delivery*

> The classroom is not a neutral space. Every pedagogical choice — what we teach, how we assess, whose voices we center — is a stance on power.

---

## What This Is

This Grove gathers the theoretical frameworks, pedagogical techniques, and practical strategies that inform my teaching. The through-line: education should serve the learner's agency, not the institution's convenience. That means democratic learning, intellectual humility, student empowerment over teacher authority, and honest reckoning with how progressive approaches can still do harm.

---

## Core Principles

- **Ethical education** that serves the learning mission over institutional needs
- **Quality over quantity** in all educational offerings
- **Authentic positioning** — no "guru" or overhyped approaches
- **Democratic learning** — minimizing power differentials between teacher and student
- **Intellectual humility** — accepting that beliefs may not always be correct
- **Student empowerment** over teacher authority and indoctrination
