# Digital Resilience

*Staying strong in a digital world*

> Resilience means the ability to **withstand shocks and adapt**. In digital life, it's about staying safe and sustainable online even as technology and threats change.

## What It Looks Like

- Recognizing phishing scams before clicking
- Using strong, unique passwords (via a password manager)
- Not getting overwhelmed by constant privacy fears
- Knowing how to adjust privacy settings on new apps
- Having habits and support to handle digital challenges

### For Communities
- Backing up important community data
- Having a plan if a service goes down
- Training members so everyone's comfortable with the tools
- Keeping operations running safely even if platforms change or hackers target you

## The Privacy Fatigue Problem

Many people today suffer from **"privacy fatigue"** — feeling overwhelmed and giving up on protecting themselves.

A digitally resilient person has the **habits and support** to handle these challenges without burning out. It's sustainable, not paranoid.

---

## Practical Examples

| Challenge | Resilient Response |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Too many passwords | Use a password manager (like Bitwarden) |
| New app, unknown settings | Take 5 minutes to check privacy options |
| Platform goes down | Have backups and alternative communication channels |
| Phishing attempt | Recognize the signs, don't click, report it |
| Privacy fatigue | Focus on one improvement at a time |

---

## Building Resilience

1. **Start small** — One habit at a time
2. **Build support** — Privacy champions help each other
3. **Create systems** — Automatic backups, password managers
4. **Accept imperfection** — Good enough is better than giving up
5. **Stay current** — Threats change, so does your knowledge

---

## The Goal

Digital resilience empowers us to **use technology on our own terms** without:
- Fear
- Fatigue
- Dependency on any single corporate platform

It's about **staying strong in a digital world, together**.
