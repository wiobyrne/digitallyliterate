# Groves

Groves are curated clusters of notes organized around a theme or pathway. While individual notes (seeds, plants, evergreens) develop single ideas, a grove sequences and connects them into a coherent thread.

Think of a grove as a guided tour through a part of the garden — a way to explore a topic in depth, following a path I've laid out.

*Groves grow as the garden grows. New pathways appear when enough notes cluster around a shared theme.*
