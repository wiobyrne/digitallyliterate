# 🪴 Groves

A **grove** is a curated cluster of related ideas. Where individual [[03 CREATE/🌲 Evergreens/🌲 Evergreens\|🌲 Evergreens]] stand on their own, a grove maps the connections between them — showing how concepts relate, reinforce, and sometimes tension against each other.

You can review all current groves at the bottom of this note.

## The Cultivation Process

A grove emerges when I notice that several mature notes share a gravitational center. Building one means:
- **Identifying the cluster**: Recognizing that a set of evergreens and plants orbit the same core question or domain.
- **Mapping relationships**: Making the connections explicit — what supports what, where tensions exist, what's missing.
- **Curating the path**: Organizing the notes so a reader can navigate the cluster meaningfully.
- **Maintaining coherence**: Keeping the grove updated as new notes enter the conversation.

## Using This Index

This index shows the thematic clusters in my garden. I use it to:
- **See the big picture**: Understand how individual ideas fit into larger domains.
- **Find gaps**: Spot areas where my thinking needs more development.
- **Guide exploration**: Offer readers a curated entry point into complex topics.
- **Plan writing**: Identify clusters mature enough to become a [[03 CREATE/🌳 Forests/🌳 Forests\|Forest]].

## The Grove Philosophy

Groves represent the belief that knowledge is networked, not hierarchical. Individual notes gain meaning through their relationships.

- **Connections over collections**: A grove isn't just a list — it's a map of how ideas interact.
- **Living structure**: Groves evolve as new notes join and existing ones mature.
- **Reader-first**: Each grove is designed to help someone navigate a complex topic without getting lost.
