# Digital Sovereignty

*Owning and controlling your digital life*

> Sovereignty means control and ownership. Digital sovereignty means **we** decide where our data lives and who can access it.

---

## What It Means

Instead of being at the mercy of big platforms, we use tools and services that **put us in charge of our own information**.

Relying on Big Tech's "free" services often means **giving up control**. True digital sovereignty is about *keeping* that control in our own hands.

---

## In Practice

For a normal person, this could be as straightforward as:

- Choosing a messaging app that **doesn't mine your messages** for data
- Using a cloud service where **you hold the keys** to your files
- Running your own server for community communications
- Choosing cooperative hosting over corporate platforms

---

## The Core Principle

**Ownership:** Your photos, documents, and conversations stay *yours*, not locked in someone else's server for their gain.

This isn't about paranoia. It's about recognizing that data is valuable, and you should be the one who benefits from yours.

---

## Levels of Sovereignty

| Level | What It Looks Like |
|-------|-------------------|
| **Individual** | Using Signal instead of WhatsApp |
| **Community** | Running a Matrix server for your organization |
| **Infrastructure** | Self-hosting your file storage on Nextcloud |
| **Full** | Owning the hardware, software, and network connection |

Most people don't need "full" sovereignty. Even small steps matter.

*Note: Sovereignty provides control; security culture determines how safely that control is exercised.*
