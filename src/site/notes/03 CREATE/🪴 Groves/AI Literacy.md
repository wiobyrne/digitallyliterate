# AI Literacy

*Knowing what the machine is doing — and what it's doing to you*

> AI literacy isn't about learning to prompt better. It's about understanding who built the system, what it optimizes for, and what it costs you to use it.

---

## What This Is

AI literacy is the ability to critically evaluate, effectively interact with, and make informed decisions about artificial intelligence. But "literacy" here means more than technical skill. It means understanding AI as a system of power — who funds it, what it extracts, whose interests it serves, and where it fails.

This Grove gathers everything in the vault about AI from a literacy perspective: the foundational concepts, the educational frameworks, the safety concerns, and the human questions AI raises about identity, agency, and trust.

---

## The Core Tension

AI tools are simultaneously:
- **The most powerful learning amplifiers** available to educators
- **The most sophisticated extraction systems** ever built for attention and data

Teaching AI literacy means holding both truths. Not technophobia. Not techno-optimism. A clear-eyed understanding of what you're working with.

## Human Agency & Boundary Work

The central question: who's in charge — you or the model?

## Safety, Sycophancy & Systemic Risk

Where AI literacy becomes a safety issue.

- [[02 DEVELOP/🌿 Plants/AI Safety Spending Gap\|AI Safety Spending Gap]] 🌿 — Frontier labs spend billions on capability. All U.S. safety orgs combined: $133M. The structural imbalance driving everything below.
- [[AI Policy and Regulation Beyond Blanket Bans to Nuanced Governance\|AI Policy and Regulation Beyond Blanket Bans to Nuanced Governance]] 🌲 — Risk-based regulation, sectoral approaches, and accountability mechanisms. The policy alternative to panic.
- [[03 CREATE/🌲 Evergreens/AI Geopolitics and the Open Model Question\|AI Geopolitics and the Open Model Question]] 🌲 — Open vs. closed models as an infrastructure control issue. Who owns the compute?
- [[Best Available Human Standard - Pragmatic Framework\|Best Available Human Standard - Pragmatic Framework]] 🌲 — Evaluate AI against actual available human resources, not idealized experts. A pragmatic lens.
- [[02 DEVELOP/🌿 Plants/Cheating Tension - Moral Ambiguity in AI Use\|Cheating Tension - Moral Ambiguity in AI Use]] 🌱 — Student guilt around AI use. The gap between policy and embodied practice.

## Identity, Trust & What AI Means for Being Human

The philosophical undercurrent.

- [[03 CREATE/🌲 Evergreens/AI and the Question of Self\|AI and the Question of Self]] 🌲 — How AI disrupts the self/subject distinction. Identity construction in the age of algorithmic personalization.
- [[02 DEVELOP/🌱 Seeds/Generative AI and Identity\|Generative AI and Identity]] 🌱 — How generative tools challenge uniqueness and authenticity. Fluidity of subject positions.
- [[02 DEVELOP/🌿 Plants/AI Beyond Simple Mimicry\|AI Beyond Simple Mimicry]] 🌿 — Modern AI has internal representations and reasoning, not just pattern matching. What does that mean for how we relate to it?
- [[02 DEVELOP/🌱 Seeds/Trust and Sincerity Detection in AI\|Trust and Sincerity Detection in AI]] 🌱 — Can AI help us evaluate trustworthiness of information? Design concepts for a browser extension approach.

## Potential Forest

This Grove feeds into: **[[02 DEVELOP/🌿 Plants/Digital Literacy Framework\|Digital Literacy Framework]]**

AI literacy is not a separate domain from digital literacy. It's the newest, most urgent frontier of the same fight: understanding who built the system you're using, what it costs you, and what alternatives exist.

*AI literacy is not about keeping up with the technology. It's about refusing to be kept by it.*
