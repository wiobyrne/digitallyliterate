# Your Digital Identity as an Educator

Welcome to week twelve of the Online Research and Media Skills (ORMS) Mentored Open Online Community (MOOC). The [ORMS MOOC](http://wiobyrne.com/join-the-orms-mooc/) has existed in different iterations over the last two years. This current version is developed as an open learning experience for students in ED 6671 ([syllabus here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18rvWMAKhnbKiSgOalGLXsE1TrBpO62mhvQXV1OeU9SY/edit?usp=sharing)). ED 6671 examines opportunities for the use of instructional technologies in an educational context.

In week twelve of the ORMS MOOC we’re completing our work in Module 5 of the MOOC and thinking about how we got here. Once again, you can learn more about the [MOOC here](http://wiobyrne.com/join-the-orms-mooc/)…and access [the actual MOOC here](https://sites.google.com/site/ormsmodel/).

### Digital Identity

As detailed in [the post last week](http://wiobyrne.com/week-eleven-creating-and-curating-your-digital-identity-ormsmooc/), in this module we’ll be thinking about the digital identity you built up over the past weeks/modules. I make the argument that we spend so much time thinking about and modifying our own offline identity and appearance, but very little time with our online identity. It's important that we focus on both as technology opens up the windows into our classroom and identity.

At this point in the module, you should have already read/viewed all (and then some) of the materials I shared. You should have shared your reflection out on a blog post and reviewed the work of others.

To obtain the badge and complete this module, you’ll need to think about possible ways to integrate online content construction into your classroom. You’re the expert of your content area…your grade level…your students. If you want your students to engage in this activity…how would you do it?

### Make this happen in your classroom

For the Digital Identity badge, all you need to do is share out the links to your blog/website. You should have worked over the ORMS MOOC to make sure everything works together on your blog/website. You shouldn't have multiple links across the Internet for your students to follow.

After you have built it up, please share it out online. Share it out on your various social networks and in our [Google+ Community](https://plus.google.com/communities/109374663190019101967?utm_source=chrome_ntp_icon&utm_medium=chrome_app&utm_campaign=chrome). After you’ve completed up to this step…go ahead and submit it in our [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ormsclass) to earn [the badge for this module](https://badges.mozilla.org/en-US/badges/badge/Digital-Identity-Exemplar-Badge).

I’ll leave in below the specific details that I share in the metadata for the badge. If you’re thoroughly confused…please ask a question in the comments/questions below. Ask questions in the various social networks. Also, take a look at the work already shared by your colleagues.
