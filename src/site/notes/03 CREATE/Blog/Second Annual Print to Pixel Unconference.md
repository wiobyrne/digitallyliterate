# Second Annual Print to Pixel Unconference

Come join us for the second annual Print to Pixel Unconference.

The members of the Education Department at the University of New Haven would like to invite you to a free, open educational event. The event will be held on Saturday, May 3rd from 8:30 AM to 3:00 PM at 600 Saw Mill Road in West Haven, CT 06516.

A light breakfast, and lunch will be provided. Organized in an “Edcamp” style, participants come and can sign up to present on a topic or just attend different sessions related to innovative education practices.  The following is a [blog post](http://wiobyrne.com/unpreparing-for-an-unconference/) that we organized for last year's session. Once again...the event is free, and open to all. 

### Can't Join Us? Check out the Hangout on Air (HoA) Lane

For those of you that would like to get involved, but cannot come out to West Haven, CT...we'll have a "HoA Lane" set up for you. We're scheduling a series of presentations via Hangout-on-Air (HoA). These sessions will be available free online. To sign up for one of these sessions, or join the HoA sessions, please check the [schedule here](http://www.newhaven.edu/4486/academic-departments/education/print-pixel-unconference/agenda/). Please also be sure to register ahead of time as these sessions will fill up.

### Love danger? Come present an Ignite session at the end of the day

The last hour of the day we'll have a session of Ignite presentations. Ignite talks are much like Pecha Kucha sessions with the main difference being that you only have 15 seconds for each of your 20 slides. Check out my [blog post](http://wiobyrne.com/creating-delivering-a-pecha-kucha-style-research-presentation/) for my earlier experience with Pecha Kucha.
