# Teaching, Learning, and Sharing Openly Online

Last week my second of four columns as Multiliteracies Department Editor for JAAL was published. The column, titled [Teaching, Learning, and Sharing Openly Online](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jaal.365/abstract) discusses the challenges and opportunities as educators and students teach and learn openly online.

Open learning is becoming a critical focus for K-12 technology-supported programs, both those strictly online as well as blended classroom practices extending into online environments. Open learning, also known as open education, can be defined as a set of practices, resources, and scholarship that are openly accessible, free to use and access, and to re-purpose.

We uploaded a pre-publication draft of the column to allow for review, remix, and commentary. Please click here for the Google Doc, or review below.

As a multimodal supplement to the column I assembled a group of experts and asked them four questions each about the column. You can review the videos below, and click through to learn more about each of the interviews.
