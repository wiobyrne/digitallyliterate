# LRA Research to Practice Episode 003 - Writing and Multimodality

Episode 003 of the LRA: Research to Practice Show will be held on Monday January 13th from 2:00-3:00 pm.

The purpose of the Research to Practice series is to connect current research and "best principles" to what could/should be happening in the classroom. We'll be using Google Hangouts-on-Air to broadcast and save the shows. This means that you can watch the show live while it is happening...and ask questions. You can watch it on YouTube after the show has completed. Because it is on YouTube you can also share with teachers and students that you believe would be interested in the topics, or the series.

This episode will focus on Writing and Multimodality. Our panel includes: [Rick Beach](https://plus.google.com/114942282814565150829/posts), [Troy Hicks](https://twitter.com/hickstro), [Jennifer Rowsell](https://twitter.com/jrowsell2), and [Paul Oh](https://twitter.com/poh). We'll unpack what "writing" means and possible intersections with multimodality. We'll provide instructional opportunities and connect to the work from the [NWP](http://www.nwp.org/), [Digital IS](http://digitalis.nwp.org/), and the upcoming [Digital Learning Day](http://www.digitallearningday.org/).
