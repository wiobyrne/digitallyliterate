# Four Questions for Garth Corbett about the Web Literacy Map

Our column on [Guiding Students as They Explore, Build, and Connect Online](http://wiobyrne.com/guiding-students-as-they-explore-build-connect-online/) was just published in [JAAL](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jaal.381/abstract). I co-wrote the column with [Greg McVerry](https://twitter.com/jgmac1106) and [Doug Belshaw](https://twitter.com/dajbelshaw/).

As a supplement to the column, we invited a series of experts to spend some time discussing the broader impact of the details presented. The end result is a series of _short_ video segments of the experts responding to a set of four questions about the column. You can review the video interview and four questions used at the bottom of this post.

_1\. If you were to apply for a job or fill out a resume, apply for college...how would you describe yourself? What knowledge and skills do you have that you believe are important for the future?_

_2\. How/where do you learn these skills?_

_3\. Why do you go out and actively learn these things?_

_4\. What do you think when people like me suggest that much of what you've learned and the way that you learn is possibly the template for what future classrooms should look like?_
