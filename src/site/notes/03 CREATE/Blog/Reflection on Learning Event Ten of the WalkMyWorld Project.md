# Reflection on Learning Event Ten of the WalkMyWorld Project

We’re at the end of Learning Event Ten of the #WalkMyWorld Project 2015. This also means that for many of us, we're at the end of the #WalkMyWorld Project 2015. You can learn more about Learning Event Nine by [clicking here](https://sites.google.com/site/walkmyworldproject/2015-learning-events/denouement).

This week we pulled all of the content together that we shared over the life of the 2015 project. We acted as curators of our own content, and embedded reflections into our shared work. We asked that you share your curated content, and complete the [participant survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1zdWPZwwhSI4r1zxKl47QUpp-OgNIcxGG7qNkAU2xbE4/viewform). After you have curated your content and shared it...and completed the survey...please apply for the ["I walked with #WalkMyWorld 2015" badge](http://badges.p2pu.org/en/badge/view/672/) on [P2PU](http://badges.p2pu.org/en/).

As you apply for the badge, I go through your materials, give feedback, and award the badge. The badge is a digital/visual representation of your achievement in the project. You can share the badge out on social networks, and embed it on your website.

### Connecting and Creating against the clock

As I have been working through the badges it has been interesting the feedback that participants have shared as they are completing the experience. There are two key themes I have noticed as people complete and reflect. The first is that they wish that they had spent more time playing and creating with digital texts and tools. The second is that they wish that they spent more time connecting with others on the hasthtag. [![](images/4938680806_9bfb95653b.jpg)](http://flickr.com/photos/15134271@N03/4938680806 "Connect by Ken Garland and Associates [290810] (5)") [creative commons licensed ( BY-NC )](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/) [flickr photo](http://flickr.com/photos/15134271@N03/4938680806 "Connect by Ken Garland and Associates [290810] (5)") shared by [danielweiresq](http://flickr.com/people/15134271@N03)

The key limiting factor in this is the amount of time they could expend in the experience. Participants indicated a rush to get the weekly learning events shared, and move on to the next learning event. Many times this only allowed for time to find and share an image, or animated GIF. Participants indicated a desire to spend more time, and possibly create less in the project.

This tension between the ten learning events and the weekly modicum of time in between modules has me thinking about future experiences. I think the ten events and the week in between are important for #WalkMyWorld as we think about identity, and as we scaffold users on to new social networks and practices. There is also a low-level of friction as we allow people to test out a multitude of tools and move on to the next week. I think this is important. I also believe that there are opportunities for longer, delayed, or much shorter lengths in open learning experiences. One example is the ORMS MOOC that I'll start up again in two weeks. We'll focus on five modules...with each module lasting two weeks. This gives an extended amount of time to search, sift, decompress, and reflect.

### Connecting with others

This past week several of us joined episode #435 of Teachers Teaching Teachers (TTT). If you missed out on the episode, please review it below. [Paul Allison](https://twitter.com/paulallison), the host of TTT has indicated that the upcoming episode on Wednesday, April 8th at 9:00 PM (EST) will invite in participants to the show to talk about the experience. If you're interested in joining...please get in touch with me, or send Paul a message.

### Wrapping up

We'll slowly start wrapping up the experience in the 2015 version of the #WalkMyWorld project. This year we expanded the work and connected with other learners globally. As we continue this experience, we'll keep building on the same good work that got us to this point. Please continue to stay in touch and connect with others in this new personal learning network (PLN) that we have created. Please also remember to respond to the [participant survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1zdWPZwwhSI4r1zxKl47QUpp-OgNIcxGG7qNkAU2xbE4/viewform) and apply for the ["I walked with #WalkMyWorld 2015" badge](http://badges.p2pu.org/en/badge/view/672/) on [P2PU](http://badges.p2pu.org/en/).

It's been a joy to work collectively with all of you over the last couple of months. If you like what you have seen...please do follow this blog and keep in touch as I continue to try and make sense of literacy practices in online spaces.
