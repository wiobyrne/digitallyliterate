# Denouement - Learning Event Ten WalkMyWorld 2015

Welcome all to Learning Event Ten in the #WalkMyWorld Project. For the full write-up on this tenth learning event, please [click here](https://sites.google.com/site/walkmyworldproject/2015-learning-events/denouement). This blog post will share the information presented in the original post on the [#WalkMyWorld Project website](https://sites.google.com/site/walkmyworldproject/), but add a bit of extra information and guidance.

### Curating your story and digital identity

This final learning event for the 2015 version of the project asks you to synthesize and curate all of the work you have completed and shared. As each of us starts and completes the work at different times this final learning event provides time to pull it all together. Additionally, because this project emulates aspects of a MOOC (i.e., massive open online class) people sometimes need time to get caught up...count me in that group. :)

This final learning event focuses on the literary term known as denouement. Denouement refers to the final outcome of a story and generally occurs after the final climax of the story. In this resolution you pull together the loose strings and reveal all elements of the plot.

As you construct and share content in the #WalkMyWorld project, please remember that you are crafting your own story. You have steadily created your digital identity throughout the learning events. Now, in the denouement, you reward readers by saving the juiciest parts of the story for the end.

### How do I do this?

For this final learning event, you have three major activities to complete.

#### First, curate everything and share it to the #WalkMyWorld hashtag.

The first step in completing the tenth learning event, and ultimately the #WalkMyWorld Project 2015 is to curate and share all of your content.

In the #WalkMyWorld we want you to move from content consumers, to content curators, to content constructors. We want you to see the value in curating content online and sharing with others. This means that there is value in the work you do on Pinterest, Learnist, and other curating platforms.

If you don't use any tool or platform, we suggest that you check out Storify or Diigo Outliner. You may also post this curated content to your website or blog. [Storify](https://storify.com/) is a free tool that can be used to create stories using social media elements. To learn more about Storify, I recommend reviewing [this tutorial](http://jgregorymcverry.com/learning-event-nine-in-walkmyworld/) put together by one of our organizers [Greg McVerry](https://twitter.com/jgmac1106). [Diigo](https://www.diigo.com/) is a free social media highlighter. You can use [Diigo Outliner](http://help.diigo.com/my-outliners-tutorials) to collect, curate, and share links. You might also chose to just embed links and reflections into a blog post or your website. You chose what works best for you. I will share more tutorials on tools to use in curating content this week here on this blog.

[![15944245872_4591e5af3c_k](images/15944245872_4591e5af3c_k-750x380.jpg)](http://wiobyrne.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/15944245872_4591e5af3c_k.jpg)

In this learning event, you should self-select and curate the content you want to highlight from #WalkMyWorld 2015. As you include content in your curated piece, please include reflections in the story. You should add in text blocks between the shared tweets and Newsletter. Please use these spaces to reflect on shared content. When you have finished, please share this out to the #WalkMyWorld hashtag.

#### Second, complete the participant survey.

As detailed throughout the project, this is an open learning experience, and an open research initiative. We are trying to identify best practices associated with open, hybrid pedagogy. To that end, we'd like to know about your experiences in the project.

Please complete the following participant survey by [clicking here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1zdWPZwwhSI4r1zxKl47QUpp-OgNIcxGG7qNkAU2xbE4/viewform). This research is being conducted, and [reported](https://sites.google.com/site/walkmyworldproject/research), in the public. As a result, we want to make our [intentions](https://sites.google.com/site/walkmyworldproject/privacy-research-guidelines) and data public. To review the results of this survey, please [click here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1v9ujsYud-xGYL3iOGhQwQ4OIV5b5R6kvLQyH_8trFAA/edit?usp=sharing).

[![15759171217_55cae76e38_k](images/15759171217_55cae76e38_k-750x380.jpg)](http://wiobyrne.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/15759171217_55cae76e38_k.jpg)

The first question asks you to share the link to the curated content piece you created for this learning event. Please share that link in the survey. The remaining questions ask about your thoughts, feelings, and some demographic questions. This data will be used by the organizers to improve the project and future activities for instruction in K through higher education.

#### Third, apply for a digital badge.

After you have completed and shared your curated content piece and the participant survey, you can apply for a digital badge on [P2PU](https://p2pu.org/en/) to show the world that you have completed the #WalkMyWorld Project 2015.

Digital badges are visual symbols of accomplishment that contain detailed claims about learning, links to evidence of learning, and they're shareable over the web. To learn more about digital badges, please [click here](http://wiobyrne.com/digital-badges-overview/).

To apply for the #WalkMyWorld 2015 participant badge, [click here](http://badges.p2pu.org/en/badge/view/672/). You will need to submit the URL for your curated content piece and reflect on the process and product involved. Once you have submitted your pledge for the badge, it will be reviewed by one of our organizers, Ian O'Byrne ([@wiobyrne](https://twitter.com/wiobyrne)). You will be awarded the badge, or given feedback on how to revise.

After being awarded the badge, please feel free to post and share your badge to the #WalkMyWorld hashtag. Thanks again for sharing and learning with us.
