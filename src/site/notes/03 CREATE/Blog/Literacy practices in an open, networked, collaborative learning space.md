# Literacy practices in an open, networked, collaborative learning space

Today I have the privilege of keynoting the [Keystone State Reading Association](http://ksrapa.org/)'s [Leadership Workshop](https://sites.google.com/site/2014ksraleadershipworkshop/home) at Penn State. Today's session will consist of a presentation & dialogue focusing on the work habits and process needed to work in an open, networked, collaborative learning space.  Specifically, we'll look at the use of digital texts and tools to allow us to:

1. [Build a system that is device agnostic, and provides ubiquitous access to data](http://wiobyrne.com/a-device-agnostic-policy-that-allows-for-ubiquitous-access-to-my-content/)
2. [Openly build, use, & share open educational resources](http://wiobyrne.com/post-promote-and-protect-your-content-online-using-creative-commons-licensing/) and [Creative Commons licensed content](http://wiobyrne.com/creative-commons-licensing-of-open-educational-content/)
3. [Create & curate your digital identity](http://wiobyrne.com/creating-and-curating-your-online-brand/)
