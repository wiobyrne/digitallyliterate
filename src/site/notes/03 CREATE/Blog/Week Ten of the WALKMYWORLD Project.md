# Week Ten of the WALKMYWORLD Project

Welcome to Week Ten, or Learning Event Ten of the #WALKMYWORLD Project. Thank you. As a community you've shared a great deal of content, and allowed us to take a peek into your world. Many of you were doing so in your first initial steps into Twitter and playing with multimodal content. You took a risk...and for that we thank you.

Now, for our final week of the #WALKMYWORLD project, we ask you to reach out and connect with someone else in the community. Last week in learning event nine, you collected and curated all of your content, and shared it with us on Twitter. As I mentioned in the [reflections](http://wiobyrne.com/reflections-from-week-nine-of-the-walkmyworld-project/) from week nine, I added all of these shares to a [Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dPpUGkVcEpgewx21loaWMaQvQctGod8M-UNkm49Fof8/edit?usp=sharing). If you're not listed on the spreadsheet, feel free to add your links and info on the spreadsheet. 

For week ten of the project, we'd like you to reach out to someone else in the project. You can review the spreadsheet to find someone to connect with. You can scroll through past weeks of the project and find someone that has intrigued you. Review the content that was shared on the Storify curation and reach out to the person that sent it. This week we'll hopefully be starting a conversation with someone else in the project.

In the Storify curation for week nine we asked that each of you include a piece at the end indicating what all of this content said about you. We provided the following prompts: _What does this content say about your identity? How are you sharing your own private history?_

We've all engaged in sharing and connecting online over these past ten weeks. Take some time and get to know someone else. Send a tweet back to another member of the #WALKMYWORLD project after you review their content. Thank them for allowing you to take a walk in their world. If you feel moved, you can send them a photo, video, or...poem...to share your thoughts about their work.

Once again, this is all about community. We're motivated by one last thought from Robert Hass. In a [interview](http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/g_l/haas/onlineinterviews.htm) he was asked how things are connected, and what makes up a community. He responded:

> They are the kinds of things that make us a community: attachment to place, attachment to local arts traditions, the ability to read literature, the ability to look at paintings, the sense of connectedness to the land, the sense of community that comes from people taking care of their own. The market doesn't make communities. Markets make networks of self-interested individuals, and they work as long as there's more than enough to go around.

 

**As you review the work of someone else in the project, consider what they shared and think about what this content says about their identity.**

**Who do you think this person is, based on the content that they shared? Do you agree with the thoughts they shared in their Storify curation?**

**Start a conversation and reach out to someone else in the project. Consider their work and connect with them by responding with your thoughts and thanks.**
