# Four Questions for Verena Roberts About Teaching, Learning, & Sharing Openly Online

Our column on teaching, learning, and sharing openly online was [just published](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jaal.365/abstract) in [JAAL](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jaal.365/abstract). I co-wrote the column with Verena Roberts, Randy LaBonte, and Lee Graham. In this case we share the challenges and opportunities associated with open, open educational resources, and open learning.

As a supplement to the column, we invited in a series of experts to spend some time discussing the broader impact of the details presented. The end result is a series of _short_ video segments of the experts responding to a set of four questions about our column. You can review the video below. At the bottom of this post I share the questions and supplemental materials from the discussion.
