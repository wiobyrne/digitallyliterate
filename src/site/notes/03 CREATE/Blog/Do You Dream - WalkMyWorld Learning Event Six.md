# Do You Dream - WalkMyWorld Learning Event Six

Welcome all to Learning Event Six in the #WalkMyWorld Project. For the full write-up on this sixth learning event, please [click here](https://sites.google.com/site/walkmyworldproject/2015-learning-events/i-dream). This blog post will share the information presented in the original post on the [#WalkMyWorld Project website](https://sites.google.com/site/walkmyworldproject/), but add a bit of extra information and guidance.

### Do you dream?

Over the first couple of weeks in the 2015 version of the #WalkMyWorld project, we asked you to share what makes you who you are. We asked you to reach out and connect with others. Last week we took a leap of faith and asked you to share your totem, or a place that calls back to you. Now, in this learning event we're pushing a bit further and asking you to share, and create digital representations of what you dream about.

Do you dream? If so, what do you dream about? What memories is your subconscious trying to bring forward? What narrative is your subliminal state of mind creating? What consequence is there for a dream deferred or unrealized? What do your dreams say about you?

### Dream a little dream

Dreams can mean different things for different people. Some of us dream and try to drain out every drop of meaning. Some of us forget and move on as the alarm goes off in the morning. Dreams sometimes have a hidden meaning for us. Dreams might also have a hidden message for those of us that are willing to listen.

How much of your dreams is a reality? Alternatively, what is the role of nightmares in this discussion?

### How do I do this?

Review the image below from [_A Monster Calls_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Monster_Calls) by Patrick Ness, illustrations by Jim Kay. The [fantasy novel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Monster_Calls) details the tribulations of a 13 year old boy (Connor) that has nightmares when an ancient yew tree visits and shares stories with Connor. The image shares a moment while the yew tree, portrayed as a monster waits for Connor to come out and find him.

After you review the image, watch the video [_American Shokunin_](https://vimeo.com/119134995) by Ryan Bush. The video details the work, art, and philosophy of Ryan Neil.

<iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/119134995?color=ffffff&amp;title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;badge=0" width="400" height="211" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

Consider the imagery in the illustration and the video. What common threads are present between the two texts? What beliefs do the authors of these texts share about our dreams and possibly our nightmares? What do the authors believe is the purpose of our dreams? What can we possibly do with our dreams if given the opportunity? What becomes of a dream deferred and allowed to dry up?

Play, create, and share an image or video of a dream that you have had and provide a subtext for that dream. You might choose to capture a photo or video. You might choose to paint or illustrate an image using an online or offline tool. You might even choose to add an audio soundscape to your work.

Tweet this response to the #WalkMyWorld hashtag. Be sure to keep an eye on the hashtag for ideas as to what others are sharing and they identify what they dream about.

### A guiding example

One of our project organizers Kate Booth ([@scu006](https://twitter.com/scu006)) and a group of [5th grade students](http://southgraftonpublicschool.edublogs.org/2014-11-11/a-monster-calls-visual-literacy/) recreated images from the novel using Microsoft Pain and [black and white photos using their iPads.](http://southgraftonpublicschool.edublogs.org/2014-12-15/a-monster-calls-photography-5dz/) The ultimate work product is an example of  mixing text, images, and colors while working with online and offline texts.
