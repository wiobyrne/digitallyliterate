# A New Hope - Negotiating the Integration of Transmedia Storytelling & Literacy Instruction

Over the past two years I have served as Multiliteracies Department Editor for the [Journal and Adolescent and Adult Literacy](http://www.reading.org/general/publications/journals/jaal.aspx) (JAAL). You can review the work that we have produced and the accompanying video interviews through [this thread](http://wiobyrne.com/tag/jaal/).

## Transmedia Storytelling and Literacy Education

For this column I worked with Stephen Slota, and Mike Young from UConn as well as Kevin Ballestrini from the Norwich Free Academy. In this column we examine the affordances and possibilities of embedding transmedia narrative and elements of gaming into literacy instruction.

You can review the final published version available [here on Academia.edu.](https://www.academia.edu/24804332/A_New_Hope_Negotiating_the_Integration_of_Transmedia_Storytelling_and_Literacy_Instruction)

[Transmedia storytelling](http://wiobyrne.com/transmedia-storytelling/) occurs when integral elements of a particular narrative are dispersed across multiple delivery channels using multiple media for the purpose of creating an integrated and coordinated storytelling experience. We believe that educators have the opportunity to reconceptualize what literacy and learning could and should look like in and out of school. It may provide opportunities for students to create their own stories that expand the lore and mythology of the overarching narrative and challenges them to resolve a variety of open, non-linear problems. These narratives also contain sociocultural elements and therefore have the opportunity to connect to readers on different levels.
