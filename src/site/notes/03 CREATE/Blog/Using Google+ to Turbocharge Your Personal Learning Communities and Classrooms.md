# Using Google+ to Turbocharge Your Personal Learning Communities and Classrooms

Over the last two weeks I've spent some time sharing materials with educators who are interested in opportunities to use Google+ as a tool for learning, socializing, and communicating with colleagues and students. I've [talked about my use of Google+](http://wiobyrne.com/develop-your-own-personal-learning-network-using-twitter-and-google/) previously as my tool of choice in my personal learning network. In this recent work I wanted to synthesize all of this information for people interested in using Google+ in their classrooms, or as a learning tool.

To that end I wrote a guest post for IRA's Reading Today blog entitled "[A Digital Toolbox: Demystifying Google+](http://www.reading.org/general/Publications/blog/engage/engage-single-post/engage/2013-10-17/a-digital-toolbox-demystifying-google-#.UmVVPGRaIgA)." To review and comment on an earlier version of this blog post, please visit the following [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BtTRIGQqZpJbsfXcXsLUdgBeVpDT6uOS3g6YoUo3VxM/edit?usp=sharing).

I also developed a series of four YouTube clips walking you through the ways in which I use Google+ and helping you set up your own system.

**Google+ Basics: Create your personal learning network** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKCyMhUvWgI

**Google+ Basics: Use Hangouts to communicate with others** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOiAM20S9nA

**Google+ Basics: Build your own learning management system** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS8cBX95f\_E

To wrap up all of these elements I held our first TechTalk of the year focusing on Google+ and invited in Nancy Atterberry and Cathy Bosco in to work through these materials and share our thinking about the use of Google+. The video for the Hangout-on-Air is embedded below.
