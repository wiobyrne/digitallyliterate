# Four Questions for Daniel Hickey and James Willis About Digital Badges

Our column on [Digital Badges: Recognizing, Assessing, and Motivating Learners In and Out of School Contexts](http://wiobyrne.com/digital-badges-recognizing-assessing-and-motivating-learners-in-and-out-of-school-contexts/) was just published in [JAAL](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jaal.381/abstract). I co-wrote the column with Katerina Schenke, James E. Willis, and Daniel Hickey.

As a supplement to the column, we invited a series of experts to spend some time discussing the broader impact of the details presented. The end result is a series of _short_ video segments of the experts responding to a set of four questions about the column. You can review the video interview and four questions used at the bottom of this post.
