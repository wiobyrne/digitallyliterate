# Experiential Learning and Its Synergy with Artificial Intelligence

When we think about the future of learning, our minds often wander to artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). These technologies have the potential to revolutionize how we learn and process information. But what if we could couple these advanced technologies with experiential learning?

Good friend [Anna CohenMiller](http://anna.cohenmiller.com/) pinged me on this topic recently, and I promised to do a bit of research and come back with some ideas. In this post, we will delve deeper into this fascinating synergy, exploring how it can redefine education and training in unprecedented ways.

## Overview

[Experiential learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiential_learning) is a process of acquiring knowledge and skills through firsthand experiences. It is a learning theory that emphasizes active engagement, critical thinking, reflection, and the application of knowledge in real-world situations. Put simply, it is a process of learning by doing, where individuals learn through hands-on experiences and reflection.

On the other hand, AI refers to a branch of computer science that allows machines to mimic human intelligence. This includes learning from experiences, adjusting to new inputs, and performing tasks that typically require human intellect. AI is also a form of _learning by doing_. It allows machines to learn from experiences, adapt to new inputs, and perform complex tasks, much like the process of learning through hands-on experiences and reflection in humans. It’s just learning from what humans have done for years and documented digitally.

### A bit more on “documented digitally”

AI and ML systems can learn in a manner similar to how humans learn through experiences. This is done by ingesting and analyzing the vast troves of digital data, content, and records that humans have created and made available online/digitally over the years.

Some examples of this are:

- Text data from websites, digital books/publications, online forums etc.
- Multimedia data like digital photos, videos, audio recordings etc.
- Databases of structured information across numerous fields.
- User-generated content on social media, reviews, blogs etc.
- Digitized records and archives that have been converted to digital formats.
- Real-world sensor data collected by digital devices and fed into AI systems.

Essentially, AI models (e.g., ChatGPT) are created, trained, and learn from the digital footprint and records created by human knowledge, activities, and experiences when converted into data formats that AI models can ingest and learn from.

## Synergy Between AI and “Learning By Doing”

Experiential Learning and AI might seem worlds apart at first glance. However, when integrated effectively, they have the potential to create highly engaging and personalized learning experiences.

1. **Understanding Experiential Learning:** The first step is understanding the core principles of experiential learning – concrete experience, reflective observation, abstract conceptualization, and active experimentation.
2. **Comprehending AI & Machine Learning:** It’s crucial to have a basic understanding of AI and machine learning: their capabilities in recognizing patterns, making predictions based on data sets, personalizing content based on user behavior etc.
3. **Integration:** The next step involves integrating AI into experiential learning platforms or programs in a way that enhances learner engagement and retention.
4. **Application:** AI can be used for analyzing an individual learner’s progress in real-time during an experiential activity or project-based task.
5. **Evaluation & Improvement:** Lastly, using AI systems’ feedback for continuous improvement in education or training programs.

## Conclusion

The marriage of experiential learning and AI is a promising frontier in education technology. Combining the effectiveness of active, hands-on learning with the personalization and adaptability of AI can lead to a more engaging, effective, and efficient learning experience. As we continue to explore this synergy, we may just find that the future of learning isn’t so distant after all.
