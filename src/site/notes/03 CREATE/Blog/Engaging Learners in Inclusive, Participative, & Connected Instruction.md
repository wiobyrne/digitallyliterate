# Engaging Learners in Inclusive, Participative, & Connected Instruction

Today I'll have the privilege of keynoting the Teaching Academy at Southern Connecticut State University. My talk will focus on opportunities to teach inclusively with technology. The materials for my sessions are available below. I'll record the session and make the screencast available at the end of the week.

We're running a [Today's Meet](https://todaysmeet.com/SCSUTA2014) during the week to provide a back channel to moderate, and archive discussion.

The link to the Digital Texts and Tools Online Repository is available [here](https://sites.google.com/site/textsandtools/).
