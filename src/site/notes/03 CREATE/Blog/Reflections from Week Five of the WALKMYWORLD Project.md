# Reflections from Week Five of the WALKMYWORLD Project

As we work our way to the end of week five in the #WALKMYWORLD project, we've made a couple changes, and uncovered more questions.

This week we started referring to the cycles as "learning events." We have a new series of people joining us this week. This provides us with an opportunity to alleviate some confusion. In the end it might just be word-smithing...but hopefully it helps.

In terms of the content that we're all sharing, it continues to be amazing and give us a look into your world. We continue to have the same smattering of ice and snow pics. We don't have as many "selfies" as I originally thought we would have. For the most part...people are getting involved and sharing on Twitter.

To that end, there are a couple of things that I would like to see as we turn the corner and move into week six of the #WALKMYWORLD project.

I'd like to see people engage and connect in the project. It might sound simple, but Twitter is, or at least should be a communication, or conversation tool. Favorite, re-tweet (RT), or reply to each other. It might seem inconsequential, but it makes others feel good when someone reads and responds to their work. Get involved...reply, favorite, comment, and RT things that you see online.

On another note, one of the concerns that we had in bringing in the focus on poetry and Robert Hass was exactly how far we could go with this. We wanted to dig in deep and really unpack the words and ideas of Hass. We'd love to get in and collaboratively annotate, and respond to these words, and how they resonate with us. The challenge with this is that we don't want to go too far out on that limb. In doing so, we might lose a ton of people.

To address this, we indicated one poem for the week. We uploaded the poem to PoetryGenius and asked that you all join in and help us collaboratively annotate this work.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23walkmyworld&amp;src=hash">#walkmyworld</a> If you haven't yet, please join and annotate poetry collaboratively: <a href="http://t.co/leu2SuN3hK">http://t.co/leu2SuN3hK</a> <a href="http://t.co/A7xovYQBly">http://t.co/A7xovYQBly</a><div></div>— kristy pytash (@kpytash) <a href="https://twitter.com/kpytash/statuses/434389001206628352">February 14, 2014</a></blockquote>

Finally, we'd still love to see more sharing, creating, and connecting using multimodal information. Please think about the Hass poems that we're sharing. Think about the larger concepts and connections that we're all making. Read up to see what [Molly Shields](http://technoliteracy.org/), [Kevin Hodgson](https://dogtrax.edublogs.org/), and [Julie Wise](http://www.flirtyourwaytoana.blogspot.com/) (_yep Julie..I called you out...now you have to blog :)_ ) think and share on their blogs. And as Kevin Hodgson stated, we'd love to see more of you integrate some of this poetry, and either reflect, or create your own work and share it with us on #WALKMYWORLD.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en">Hoping to see some <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23walkmyworld&amp;src=hash">#walkmyworld</a> folks take a turn into poetry as they document their world. Put words to image. Sound to the Still.<div></div>— KevinHodgson (@dogtrax) <a href="https://twitter.com/dogtrax/statuses/433773914788225025">February 13, 2014</a></blockquote>
