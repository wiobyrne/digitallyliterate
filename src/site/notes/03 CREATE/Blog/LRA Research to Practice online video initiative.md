# LRA Research to Practice online video initiative

Today (2013-11-04) we finally have the opportunity to start a new initiative with the [Literacy Research Association](http://www.literacyresearchassociation.org/). For those of you that are not aware, the LRA is a community of scholars dedicated to promoting research that enriches the knowledge, understanding, and development of lifespan literacies in a multicultural and multilingual world. I currently work as the e-editor for LRA, as well as a member of the Policy and Legislative Committee and the Technology Committee. I consider LRA to be my "home conference" and look forward to attending every year. I value this time with my colleagues as I present, interact, and push my own thinking for the upcoming year.

Two years ago Greg McVerry and I began our work as e-editors for LRA and began to examine possible ways that we could make LRA much more "open" through the use of various technologies. With a group of colleagues we started a series of daily "Digital Texts and Tools" meetings during the study group time. The purpose of these meetings is to provide tech support for colleagues in a low-stress environment. We love using technology...and wanted to get others excited about using it as well. As part of this initiative, we started the [Digital Texts and Tools Online Repository](https://sites.google.com/site/textsandtools/). This collaboratively built website is a way to share and archive resources for literacy-based instruction that can be used in K-12 or higher education environments. After developing these tools for a year we begin to think about possible ways to have these sessions year-round. I love my time at the LRA Conference...but we should be able to use the Internet and other communication technologies to continue the discussion.

In light of these discussions we are starting the LRA: Research to Practice show. This show will meet on the first Monday of every month and try to connect current research to the best practices that should be happening in our classrooms. We'll be using Google Hangouts-on-Air to broadcast and save all shows. This means that you can either watch the show live while it is happening...and ask questions. Or, you can watch it on YouTube after the show has completed. Because it is on YouTube you can also share with teachers and students that you believe would be interested in the topics, or the series. I'll put together a forum post for each individual show. All shows will be broadcast on the [LRA YouTube channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/LiteracyResearch/live).

The subject of this first episode is on Disciplinary Literacies. Our panel includes Michael Manderino, Kristy Pytash, Phil Wilder, and Paula DiDomenico. Caitlin McMunn Dooley will be serving as our discussant for the first episode. You can watch the event live at the YouTube channel listed above. You can also view the show resources and join the chat at the following [TitanPad](You can also review and comment on show notes at the following link: wiobyrne.titanpad.com/3).
