# The Paradox of White Racial Resentment - A Review of 'Dying of Whiteness


Extended Summary:

"Dying of Whiteness: How the Politics of Racial Resentment Is Killing America's Heartland" is an in-depth exploration of race and politics in America. Author Jonathan M Metzl delves into issues such as gun rights, healthcare reform, and school funding to highlight how policies favored by many white Americans can often lead to harmful consequences for them. 

The book uses extensive research and firsthand accounts from individuals in Missouri, Tennessee, and Kansas to illustrate its arguments. It shows how fears around losing racial status have often influenced policy decisions that are ultimately against the best interests of those who support them.

For example, Metzl details how policies around gun control have led to increased rates of suicide among white men; or how opposition to healthcare reform has resulted in poorer health outcomes for many white Americans. Similarly, he examines shifts in education funding which have left many schools under-resourced.

"Dying of Whiteness" presents a compelling argument about the intersectionality of race, politics, and public health. It challenges readers to consider how powerful ideologies can sometimes blind individuals to their own self-interests.

Author Jonathan M Metzl, a psychiatrist and sociologist, delves into the health implications of certain political ideologies and policies on white working-class Americans. In particular, he examines the impact of the conservative politics on their health outcomes.

Metzl argues that the politics of racial resentment combined with anti-government sentiment can lead to policies that are detrimental to the health of white Americans. These include opposition to gun control, resistance to affordable healthcare, and support for cuts in social services. 

The book's title refers to the paradox where white Americans who support such policies are inadvertently harming their own well-being. Metzl uses statistical analysis and personal stories from people living in southern and mid-western states to illustrate this phenomenon.
