# Guiding Students as They Explore, Build, & Connect Online

My fourth column as Multiliteracies Department Editor for the [Journal and Adolescent and Adult Literacy](http://www.reading.org/general/publications/journals/jaal.aspx) (JAAL) was published. The column, titled [Guiding Students as They Explore, Build, and Connect Online](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jaal.411/abstract) discusses the Web Literacy Map I've been helping to develop over the last couple of years. In the column, I work with [Greg McVerry](https://twitter.com/jgmac1106) and [Doug Belshaw](https://twitter.com/dajbelshaw/) to give a topographical view of the web literacy map as it is currently constituted. We also include some guidance on how to get involved.

The World Wide Web has become this generation’s defining technology for literacy. This technology facilitates access to an unlimited amount of online information in a participatory learning space. Multiple theories and years of research have investigated the literacy practices in these online and hybrid spaces. Yet, as early adopters, history’s first generation of “always connected” individuals do not have the knowledge and skills to critically explore, build, and connect online. Simply stated, students are often not provided with opportunities in school to practice the web literacies necessary to read, write, and participate on the web. The Mozilla Foundation and community of volunteers have worked to address this paradox by creating a Web Literacy Map. These efforts seek not to simply understand the web but to empower adolescents to help build a better open web.

We uploaded a pre-publication draft of the column to allow for review, remix, and commentary. Please [click here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FAVhrGgQ_CQ8mElrvTZOcJdpQnaps_HitLiLjr6gnNY/edit?usp=sharing) for the Google Doc, or review below.

As a multimodal supplement to the column, I assembled a group of experts and asked them four questions each about the column. You can review the videos below, and click through to learn more about each of the interviews.
