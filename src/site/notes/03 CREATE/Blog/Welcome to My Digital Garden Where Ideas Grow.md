# Welcome to My Digital Garden: Where Ideas Grow

After publishing over 800 blog posts here on wiobyrne.com and sending more than 400 issues of my Digitally Literate newsletter, I'm excited to invite you into a new space: my digital garden.

## What is a Digital Garden?

Unlike a traditional blog with its reverse-chronological posts or a newsletter with its regular cadence, a digital garden is a living collection of ideas and notes that grow over time. Some thoughts are seedlings and are just beginning to sprout. Others are well-tended, fully developed concepts. All are connected through a network of links and associations that mirror how we actually think.

Digital gardening is about learning in public, sharing ideas at various stages of development, and creating connections between seemingly disparate topics. It's less about publishing finished work and more about cultivating knowledge over time.

## What You'll Find in My Garden

This space brings together multiple streams of my work and thinking:

- **Curated highlights** from 400+ issues of Digitally Literate (digitallyliterate.net)
- **Expanded thinking** from wiobyrne.com blog posts
- **Notes and annotations** from my personal knowledge management system
- **Resources and insights** from my teaching, research, and presentations
- **Connections between ideas** that span education, technology, literacy, and scholarship

You'll find content in various stages, some polished, some still developing. That's by design. This garden reflects how knowledge actually grows: organically, sometimes messily, and always in conversation with other ideas.

## Why Process Matters as Much as Product

For years, I've been drawn to the idea of a personal wiki. A space where I could showcase not just finished work, but the thinking journey behind it. I wanted to create a place where process is valued alongside product, where half-formed ideas can breathe and evolve.

As I read across multiple mediums and sources (academic journals, books, social media, newsletters, conversations) I found myself wanting a space to connect these dots publicly. The connections between seemingly unrelated ideas often yield the most interesting insights, and I wanted to share that process.

Now, with advances in digital tools and some help from generative AI to figure out the technical aspects, I can finally make this vision a reality. This garden is the result of that long-held desire to open up my notes and thinking process to others who might benefit from seeing how ideas develop over time.

## How to Explore

Unlike a blog where you might start with the newest post, I invite you to wander. Follow links that interest you. Discover unexpected connections. Return to see how ideas have evolved. Use the search function to find specific topics or browse collections to see how concepts cluster together.

Some paths will be well-worn, others newly forged. You might encounter:

- üìö Academic publications connected to practical classroom applications
- üé§ Key insights from presentations with personal reflections added
- üßë‚Äçüè´ Teaching resources linked to theoretical foundations
- üóÇÔ∏è Book notes connected to newsletter themes and research questions

## Why Now?

After years of publishing in separate spaces‚Äîformal academic writing here, newsletter curation there, personal notes elsewhere, podcast episodes somewhere‚ÄîI wanted to create an ecosystem where these ideas could cross-pollinate and where you could see the connections I'm making across disciplines and projects.

This garden doesn't replace my blog or newsletter, it complements them. I'll continue posting more formal pieces here on wiobyrne.com and sending Digitally Literate to subscribers. But the garden offers a different way to engage with my work: less chronological, more connective.

## A Living Resource

Digital gardens are never "done." They grow, change, and sometimes need pruning. I'll be continuously adding new content, updating existing notes, and creating new pathways through this knowledge space.

I hope you'll find something valuable here, whether you're a longtime reader or just discovering my work. Feel free to explore at your own pace and return often. There will always be something new taking root.

Thank you for visiting. Let's see what grows.
