# Letters in Support of the UNH Education Department

The following is a collection of the correspondence and letters of support submitted to the UNH President, Board of Directors, and Education Department. These letters were submitted in response to the proposed "phase out" of the Education Department all programs.

No alterations have been made to the content with the exception formatting after the copy/paste procedure. The purpose of sharing these documents is to archive the thoughts and commentary from the senders as well as to document this period in the history of UNH. The documents are also being shared to promote the spirit of transparency, collegiality, and promote dialogue.

The complete folder of documents can be viewed at this [link](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B_SIJN0cY2IhV3BYYTdfMFFoSFE&usp=sharing).
