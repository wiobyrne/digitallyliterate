# Come Join Us for the 2015 Version of the WalkMyWorld Project

We'd like to invite you to join us for the 2015 version of the #WalkMyWorld Project. The project is a social media experiment in which we connect, collaborate, and share online.

### **So what does this all mean?**

Over the next ten weeks, we would like you all to share (once a week) with us a “walk” in your “world.” There really are no rules to this challenge. The only real “rule” to this challenge is that we ask that you share this publicly on Twitter, and include the hashtag (#WalkMyWorld) in your post. Each week we'll share a prompt and some collection of text to help guide us. The prompts will all be shared [here on the project website](https://sites.google.com/site/walkmyworldproject/2015-learning-events).

### **Who is this for?**

You. Are you interested in learning how to use Twitter? Are you interested in connecting and learning with others online? Are you interested in having fun? Thinking about how to build up your digital identity? For all that and more...come join us. Lurkers also welcome. :)

### **Be thoughtful in your posts**

Please keep in mind that in this work you are openly posting information to the Internet. I believe that it is important that we [educate, empower, and advocate](http://wiobyrne.com/privacy-identity-and-protecting-yourself-and-your-students-online/) for the use of digital texts and tools as a literacy. I also believe that teachers and students should think critically about how they [create and curate](http://wiobyrne.com/creating-and-curating-your-online-brand/) their online brand. That being said…I want you all be thoughtful, and careful as you select what to share online about yourself. Please do not post or share anything that you feel does not represent you in the best light.

### **Play…and then share**

In this challenge, you are playing with, creating, and sharing digital content in online spaces. The key element here is to have fun, connect, and experiment with the digital texts and tools. Be sure be thoughtful and protect yourself as you share online. Be sure to include the #WalkMyWorld hashtag in your posts. Include yourself on [the #WalkMyWorld Map](https://sites.google.com/site/walkmyworldproject/where) by [pinning yourself to the map](https://sites.google.com/site/walkmyworldproject/maps).

Please visit the [#WalkMyWorld project site](https://sites.google.com/site/walkmyworldproject/) to learn everything and anything you want about the project.

This first week is our "slow start." This is meant to get everyone on to Twitter and sharing. Create a Twitter account and come [follow me](https://twitter.com/wiobyrne), and [others in the project](https://sites.google.com/site/walkmyworldproject/organizers). We'll get rolling next week!!!
