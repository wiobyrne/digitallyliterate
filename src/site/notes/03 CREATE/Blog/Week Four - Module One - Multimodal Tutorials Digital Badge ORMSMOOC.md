# Week Four - Module One - Multimodal Tutorials Digital Badge ORMSMOOC

Welcome to week four of the Online Research and Media Skills (ORMS) Mentored Open Online Community (MOOC). The [ORMS MOOC](http://wiobyrne.com/join-the-orms-mooc/) has existed in different iterations over the last two years. This current version is developed as an open learning experience for students in ED 6671 ([syllabus here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18rvWMAKhnbKiSgOalGLXsE1TrBpO62mhvQXV1OeU9SY/edit?usp=sharing)). ED 6671 examines opportunities for the use of instructional technologies in an educational context. We’ll not only discuss what to use in your classroom…but also how to use it.

As discussed in the post for last week, the MOOC will now be organized around [five modules](https://sites.google.com/site/ormsmodel/modules)...each module lasting two weeks. Currently we're in the second week of the first module on Multimodal Tutorials. Next week...we'll start up Module 2 and look at Online Collaborative Inquiry.

### What do I need to do this week?

As mentioned [in the post](http://wiobyrne.com/week-three-multimodal-tutorials-ormsmooc/) last week, you should have read and synthesized the materials in [Module 1](https://sites.google.com/site/ormsmodel/modules/module-1) of the ORMS MOOC at this point. After you read and synthesize, you should post a response to the reflection question posed on the [Discussion and Badges page](https://sites.google.com/site/ormsmodel/modules/module-1/discussions) for Module 1. You should incorporate the use of [Storify](http://wiobyrne.com/content-curation-using-storify-as-a-formative-assessment/) to help indicate what you read, where you read it...and whom you communicated with in your research for Module 1.

Once again...this should have been completed last week and shared out to the [Google+ Community](https://plus.google.com/communities/109374663190019101967), and out to your favorite social networks. Be sure to use the hashtags (#ORMSMOOC and #ed6671).

If you reference [the syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18rvWMAKhnbKiSgOalGLXsE1TrBpO62mhvQXV1OeU9SY/edit), this week you are to first provide a blog post that updates your progress on your [networked learning project](http://wiobyrne.com/week-two-networked-learning-project-ormsmooc-ed6671/). In your blog post you should indicate your specific learning goals or objectives in your networked learning project. Yes...I want you to write these in the same format you would write learning goals for your students.

### Multimodal Tutorials and Digital Badges

This week you'll also develop a multimodal tutorial for a digital text or tool of your choice that you would use with your students. In the ORMSMOOC you will develop a series of materials using educational technologies that you can integrate into a unit or theme you would like to teach in your content area. As you think about the digital text or tool you would like to use with your students...think about a unit, theme, or piece of content you love to teach. Consider a digital tool that you could embed into this unit, in your content area.

Once you have selected a digital text or tool, develop a [multimodal tutorial](http://wiobyrne.com/creating-and-sharing-multimodal-tutorials/) for your unit or content area. Your multimodal tutorial should include text, links, and screencaptures, screencasts...or both. Think about what your students would need to really utilize the tool you're suggesting. If you have worksheets, rubrics, graphic organizers, or other scaffolding tools...please include them. Add all of this content to one page on your blog or learning hub.

You'll then have to share your work out to a couple different places.

1. First, share your post or page out to the [Google+ Community](https://plus.google.com/communities/109374663190019101967), and out to your favorite social networks. Be sure to use the hashtags (#ORMSMOOC and #ed6671).
2. Second, share the post or page out to the [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ormsclass) we're using to keep track of the badges for the ORMS MOOC. In this post in the Google Group, you'll need to leave some text indicating what you're sharing. Please also include links out to the blog post, or web page that houses all of your materials for the multimodal tutorial. This content will be reviewed...and if it is acceptable and appropriate, you'll earn a badge for Module 1. You will receive feedback in the Google Group letting you know if you earned the badge...or need to make changes to your content.
3. After you are awarded the badge for your multimodal tutorial and Module 1, please add your multimodal tutorial to the [other tutorials](https://sites.google.com/site/textsandtools/techtutorials) available on the [Digital Texts and Tools](https://sites.google.com/site/textsandtools/) repository. You should follow the [template](https://sites.google.com/site/textsandtools/techtutorialtemplate) that we developed to guide individuals as they add content to the tutorials pages.
4. Celebrate. You're finished the work for Module 1. Share out your badge for Module 1...try and find ways to show it off on your blog or classroom website. :)

Good work all. This week we'll wrap up Module 1, and move on to Module 2. As detailed earlier...all of this work is self-paced. Each module lasts two weeks, but we really do not have any due dates. When you finish the modules...apply for the badges. You should be able to complete all of the work and earn all of the badges by the end of the trimester. Good luck!!!
