## screens on screens off and screens on the side activities what do they look like and what are the benefits

## Intro
In the digital age, time spent on screens has become an integral part of our lives. From work to education, entertainment to communication, our reliance on digital screens is undeniable. In this blog post, we will explore the concept of 'screens on, screens off and screens on the side activities' - a balanced approach to screen time that promotes productivity and wellness in our digitally dominated lives.

## Overview
'Screens on' refers to time spent actively engaging with digital devices such as smartphones, computers or tablets. 'Screens off' represents periods of non-digital activities or rest, while 'screens on the side activities' are tasks accomplished with passive screen use like listening to music or podcasts. By balancing these three aspects, we can reap numerous benefits including enhanced productivity, mental wellbeing and holistic personal development.

Let's delve deeper into how we can incorporate this balanced approach into our daily routines.

## Steps

1. **Define your 'Screens On' Time**: Identify tasks that require active screen engagement like work-related tasks, online learning or video calls. Prioritize these tasks based on their urgency and importance.

2. **Schedule 'Screens Off' Time**: Designate specific times in your day for non-digital activities such as physical exercise, reading a book or spending quality time with loved ones. This helps in reducing screen fatigue and promotes mental health.

3. **Leverage 'Screens On The Side' Activities**: Utilize passive screen time to engage in leisurely activities that do not demand active digital interaction like listening to music or podcasts. This can help in relaxation and mental rejuvenation.

4. **Maintain Flexibility**: It's important to remember that this approach should be flexible according to individual needs and circumstances. Regular evaluation and adjustment of your schedule can help maintain a healthy balance.

## Conclusion
A balanced approach to screen time can significantly improve our productivity and overall wellbeing. As we continue to navigate through the digital age, it's essential to consciously incorporate 'screens on, screens off and screens on the side activities' into our daily routines. The benefits are manifold - from enhanced focus and productivity to improved mental health and personal development.

Remember, the key is not to eliminate screen time but to use it wisely and productively.
