# Web Literacy Map - Read, write, & participate for a better web

This week the video I produced with the help of [Greg McVerry](https://twitter.com/jgmac1106) was [released here](http://k12onlineconference.org/2015-10-27/web-literacy-map-version-1-5-read-write-and-participate-for-a-better-web/) as part of the [K12 Online 2015](http://k12onlineconference.org/) series of videos. In this video, we worked to document the work on the web literacy map up to version 1.5. You can read more about this work in [the column we wrote](http://wiobyrne.com/guiding-students-as-they-explore-build-connect-online/) with [Doug Belshaw](https://twitter.com/dajbelshaw/) for the [Journal of Adolescent and Adult Literacy](http://www.reading.org/general/publications/journals/jaal.aspx).

As part of this earlier publication, I conducted a series of short interviews with experts in the field. You can review all of these videos [on the same blog post](https://dougbelshaw.com/blog/2015-02-09/two-years-of-weblitmap/). I used some of these videos to create the video shared for K12 Online 2015.

If you're interested in learning more about the work on the web literacy map up to version 1.5, I would read [this post](https://dougbelshaw.com/blog/2015-02-09/two-years-of-weblitmap/) by Doug that details a visual history of the first two years of the web literacy map. Additionally, you should also [review this post](http://wiobyrne.com/web-literacy-map-lra-response/) documenting a presentation of the materials and relevant critique that was collected at the 2014 meeting of the Literacy Research Association.

## What is the web literacy map?

The World Wide Web has become this generation’s defining technology for literacy. This technology facilitates access to an unlimited amount of online information in a participatory learning space. Multiple theories and years of research have investigated the literacy practices in these online and hybrid spaces. Yet, as early adopters, history’s first generation of “always connected” individuals do not have the knowledge and skills to critically explore, build, and connect online. Simply stated, students are often not provided with opportunities in school to practice the web literacies necessary to read, write, and participate on the web. The Mozilla Foundation and community of volunteers have worked to address this paradox by creating a Web Literacy Map. These efforts seek not to simply understand the web but to empower adolescents to help build a better open web.

## Remixing online content

To create this video, and [the teaser](http://wiobyrne.com/introducing-web-literacy-reading-writing-participating/), I remixed video from the interviews conducted for [this work](http://wiobyrne.com/web-literacy-map-lra-response/) and [this work](http://wiobyrne.com/guiding-students-as-they-explore-build-connect-online/). I also downloaded and remixed the following Creative Commons licensed video content:

I also used this CC-licensed audio track to use as the backbone of the video:

- [https://soundcloud.com/redshirtbeats/fahey-chill-upbeat-acoustic](https://soundcloud.com/redshirtbeats/fahey-chill-upbeat-acoustic)

I remixed all of this content in iMovie and added a voiceover narration to complete the piece.

## Next steps

I hope this video is of value to readers and writers in online and hybrid spaces. As future events warrant, I'll continue to document and discuss the development of the web literacy initiative. The web literacy map builds on the principles that all learning, especially literacy is social. Anyone can become a webmaker, and over the next year exciting features will emerge to support new users.

Want to get involved? We encourage you to become a mentor in the community. Use the competencies to plan learning activities that integrate web literacies. Reflect on this work in your own online spaces by blogging about it. Include the #teachtheweb and/or #webliteracy hashtags in your posts across social media. Join the community calls. We ultimately get the web we build and with your help this web will be open and free.
