# My (Current) Thoughts on the Mozilla Web Literacy Initiative

I recently had the privilege to spend about 45 minutes with my good friend [Doug Belshaw](https://twitter.com/dajbelshaw) to discuss our work on the Mozilla Web Literacy Map. Doug is on a quest to "push pause" on our work with the #weblitmap to talk with some people to figure out what direction we should head next. I definitely recommend scrolling through the other individuals he in the process of interviewing. You'll find a cool collection of some awesome people online....far cooler than me. :) You can find everything here at the [WebLiteracy Tumblr](http://webliteracy.tumblr.com/).

You can find [my interview here](http://webliteracy.tumblr.com/post/96526930079/a-long-time-contributor-to-the-web-literacy-map) where I share my thoughts on where I believe the Web Literacy Map should head. I've been lucky to follow along and witness the growth of this initiative since the very beginning. Please go over to [review the interview](http://webliteracy.tumblr.com/post/96526930079/a-long-time-contributor-to-the-web-literacy-map)...and the other interviews in the sequence at the [WebLiteracy Tumblr](http://webliteracy.tumblr.com/). We need to build up a response and get some solid feedback as we scale up our work.

 

In a related story, I've been impressed by a lot of content construction and blogging that Doug shares online. I really like his use of audio recordings and embedding this into blogs and most notably on Tumblr. I also appreciate the way that Doug archives content on Archive.org. I'm considering following suit with content that I help develop through different initiatives.

I asked Doug what process he uses to prepare and share audio recordings to make it look so professional. You can review his blog post [here](http://thoughtshrapnel.com/post/96535645102/howto-prepare-and-share-audio-from-skype-interviews).
