# Literacy Instruction & Learning in Virtual, Blended, & Hybrid Learning Environments

[Kristy Pytash](https://twitter.com/kpytash) and I recently published a chapter titled Research on Literacy Instruction and Learning in Virtual, Blended, and Hybrid Learning Environments in the _Handbook of Research on K-12 Online and Blended Learning_. You can review and download the Handbook under a CC license [here](http://press.etc.cmu.edu/content/handbook-research-k-12-online-and-blended-learning-0).

In the chapter we drawing on current literacy research to examine and synthesize the relevant research and best practices associated with literacy learning and teaching in virtual, blended and hybrid environments in K-12 settings. While the research base for literacy education in virtual schools, blended, and hybrid learning environments is significantly limited, it is supported by research conducted in the field of literacy education investigating reading and writing in online spaces. The chapter provides specific recommendations and implications for writing instruction and reading instruction in online education spaces. We also suggest implications for future research.
