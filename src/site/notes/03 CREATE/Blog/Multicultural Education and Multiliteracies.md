# Multicultural Education and Multiliteracies

With my colleague Shane Smith, we recently conducted some research investigating opportunities for instruction in a hybrid learning environment. We used a Google+ Community to allow our students to read, respond, and react to readings and peers to extend discussion from the face-to-face classroom. The research identifies opportunities for multicultural education, culturally responsive teaching, multiliteracies, and hybrid learning environments. The research was published in _Reading & Writing Quarterly_ in 2015.

### Abstract

This quasi-experimental, mixed model study explored the use of an instructional approach that provided direct instruction and experiences in multicultural education while empowering preservice teachers to examine their perspectives using a hybrid classroom format. The purpose of the study was to explore preservice teachers’ attitudes and dispositions toward the integration of multicultural education and multiliteracies to promote literacy among struggling readers. For the purposes of this study, we defined multicultural education as a field of study and an emerging discipline whose major aim is to create educational opportunities for all students, including students who are traditionally disenfranchised, to meaningfully and successfully engage in the education process. The study used a convenience sample of preservice teachers enrolled in a graduate-level educational program at a small private university in the Northeast. Results indicate opportunities for the use of an instructional approach that provides direct instruction and experiences in multicultural education while empowering preservice teachers to examine their perspectives in a hybrid classroom environment.

### Multicultural Education and Demographic (MEaD) Instrument

One of the data points we used in the research was an instrument that we developed to understand teacher dispositions and demographic information that might affect the research questions and findings.
