# Four Questions for Don Wettrick About Teaching, Learning, & Sharing Openly Online

Our column on teaching, learning, and sharing openly online was [just published](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jaal.365/abstract) in [JAAL](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jaal.365/abstract). I co-wrote the column with Verena Roberts, Randy LaBonte, and Lee Graham. In this case we share the challenges and opportunities associated with open, open educational resources, and open learning.

As a supplement to the column, we invited in a series of experts to spend some time discussing the broader impact of the details presented. The end result is a series of _short_ video segments of the experts responding to a set of four questions about our column. You can review the video below. At the bottom of this post I share the questions and supplemental materials from the discussion.

1. _How do you define "open" and how does this affect teaching and learning in the classroom?_
2. _As an educator that is open, what does this look like in your classroom, for your students. What does an average day look like?_
3. _As an educator in the open...what does an average day look like online for you in your PLNs? What do you do outside of school? What are your interactions like?_
4. _What challenges and opportunities do you have from these experiences?_
