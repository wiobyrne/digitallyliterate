# Designing the Structure of My Digital Garden

In building my digital garden, Iâ€™ve realized the importance of a solid structure to keep my ideas organized and accessible. Here, Iâ€™ll share how Iâ€™ve designed my note-taking framework, from folders to tags and the development stages of notes like seeds, plants, and evergreens.

## Folders: Laying the Foundation

When working with digital notes, organizing and developing ideas can feel overwhelming. To address this, Iâ€™ve implemented a system that combines a flexible workflowâ€”**CONSUME, CURATE, CREATE, and META**â€”with a growth-oriented tagging structure. Together, these approaches ensure every idea evolves from raw input to a polished output, fostering clarity and creativity.

The backbone of my digital garden is my folder structure, which provides a clear hierarchy for organizing different types of content:

- **01 CONSUME**: Raw inputs and fleeting thoughts go here. Itâ€™s a capture zone for highlights, articles, or spontaneous ideas.
- **02 CURATE**: In this stage, ideas are refined and connected. Notes grow into structured concepts or frameworks.
- **03 CREATE**: Final outputsâ€”blog posts, presentations, or projectsâ€”are built from curated ideas.
- **META**: This is a home for the vaultâ€™s templates, guides, and administrative elements. A vault is a folder or directory where all your notes are stored, essentially acting as a central repository for your information within the application.

This framework organizes the flow of information but doesnâ€™t provide granular detail on how individual notes evolve. Thatâ€™s where the tagging system comes in.

## Tags: Adding Context and Flexibility

Tags act as the connective tissue across folders, helping me locate and relate notes easily. Hereâ€™s how I use them:

- **Content-based tags**: These include themes like `#creativity`, `#productivity`, and `#digital-literacy`.
- **Progress tags**: Notes on books, articles, videos, or podcasts are tagged with `#to-read`, `#reading`, or `#read`. Written or creative pieces (blog posts, research articles, presentations, class lectures) are tagged with `#draft`, `#created`, or `#published`.
- **Development stage tags**:
  - ðŸŒ± `_seed` for initial ideas.
  - ðŸŒ¿ `_plant` for developing concepts.
  - ðŸŒ² `_evergreen` for fully developed, polished notes.

Focusing on these dynamic processes ensures that my digital garden is a living, evolving space for exploration and growth rather than a static repository of finished outputs.

## Seeds, Plants, and Evergreens: A Framework for Growth

In my digital garden, I prioritize process over product, valuing the journey of developing ideas more than just their final form. This philosophy is embedded in the structure of my notes, particularly through the **Seed, Plant, Evergreen** framework. Each stage represents a milestone in the growth of an idea, from its initial capture to a refined, interconnected insight. This approach emphasizes the iterative nature of learning and creation, encouraging me to revisit and nurture ideas over time.

I use a gardening metaphor to describe the development stages of my notes:

- **Seeds**: Quick ideas captured in a sentence or two, often with minimal context. These notes will live in the CONSUME folder until further processing is completed.
- **Plants**: Notes that have been expanded with context, connections, and insights. These typically move to the CURATE folder for further refinement.
- **Evergreens**: Fully developed notes that are ready to be published or referenced as reliable sources. These are stored in CREATE and often linked across my digital garden.

## The Logic Behind the Hierarchy

This structure reflects the natural progression of ideas:

1. **Capture**: Raw inputs and fleeting thoughts go to CONSUME.
2. **Process**: Ideas are developed and connected in CURATE.
3. **Publish**: Final outputs are stored in CREATE.
4. **Maintain**: Templates and meta-notes live in META to support ongoing workflows.

Iâ€™ve created a flexible system that grows with me by combining folders, tags, and development stages. Each note, whether itâ€™s a seed or an evergreen, has a clear place in the ecosystem, making it easier to locate and build upon.

## A Glimpse Ahead

This system isnâ€™t static. As my needs evolve, so will my digital garden. Iâ€™m continuously experimenting with optimizing my workflow, and Iâ€™d love to hear how others structure their knowledge management systems. Feel free to share your thoughts or questions!
