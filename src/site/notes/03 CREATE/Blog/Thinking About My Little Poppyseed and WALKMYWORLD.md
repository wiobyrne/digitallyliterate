# Thinking About My Little Poppyseed and WALKMYWORLD

For week one of the #WALKMYWORLD project I tried to identify the best use of my time and work during the project. I initially started posting old images and videos from Instagram and Vine. I was then motivated by some work that a student of Molly Shields posted for the project. The student shared a walk from her past. That got me thinking about possibilities I could have for using #WALKMYWORLD to document my own life.

In thinking about this, I chose to use my time in the project to document my life for my son Jax. This exploration is of a very private nature, but I'm choosing to conduct this walk in public, using digital texts and tools.

This first week I'm sharing the motivation for all of this work, by son. His affectionate nickname...before we named him was "poppyseed." This is because when we found out that we were pregnant the doctor told us that he was the size of a poppyseed. As a result, our Facebook photos all showed poppyseeds and friends/family had no idea what was happening.Â Slowly over time the pictures got bigger and bigger in size...all organic "hints" until we announced that we were in fact pregnant.

Now, he's a healthy, happy 3 1/2 year old. In thinking about, and planning for week one of the project, I had a lunch date with Katie and Jax and watched him trying to write out his name for the first time by himself. We've come a long way in a short amount of time.

For the #WALKMYWORLD project, I'll continue to document my life. In this process I'll identify specific times in my life, or events that I think help develop my identity.
