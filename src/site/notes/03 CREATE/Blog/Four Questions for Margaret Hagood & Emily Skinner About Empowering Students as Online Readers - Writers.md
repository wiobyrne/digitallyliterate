# Four Questions for Margaret Hagood & Emily Skinner About Empowering Students as Online Readers - Writers

My column on Empowering Learners in the Reader/Writer Nature of the Digital Informational Space was just published in [Volume 58, Issue 2](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jaal.2014.58.issue-2/issuetoc) of [JAAL](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1002/(ISSN)1936-2706). In this column I make the case that educators have the opportunity to empower learners as not only readers, but writers of online information. To do this we need to move students (and ourselves) from content consumers, to content curators, to content construction.

As a supplement to this column I invited five experts to spend some time discussing the broader impact of the details presented. The end result are short video segments of the experts responding to four questions about the implications of this work. Down below you can find the questions and video from one of the sessions.

**Four Questions for Margaret Hagood and Emily Skinner**

- _If we were to develop a classroom in which students could be empowered to read and write online text...what would it look like?_ 
- _How do we support pre-service and veteran teachers so they can prepare their learning space for these changes in literacy and technology_
- _In the column I discuss this intersection that I see between critical literacy and the use of the Internet. From your perspective, what are the ramifications of having students remix, re-write, or reconstruct information they read online?_
- _What should teachers and students know about identity construction and production on the internet?_
