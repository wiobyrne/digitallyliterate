# Community Survey - Help Develop the Web Literacy Map 2.0

We're busy developing badges and learning pathways for the web literacy map. In between working cycles we'll take a step back and work on revising and iterating on the current grid of web literacies. As always, this work will be conducted in the open and allow for transparency.

To that end, please take the time to complete the following short survey to give us feedback about what you would like to see in the Web Literacy Map 2.0. The survey should take about five minutes. Your support is appreciated.

You can take the survey [here](http://goo.gl/forms/LKNSNrXCnu).
