# Innovative Teaching and Learning with Digital Media Texts, Tools & Technologies

I have the privilege of presenting today at the 2013 Summer Institute in Digital Literacy at the University of Rhode Island. The theme of the institute is Innovative Teaching and Learning with Digital Media Texts, Tools & Technologies. Please follow along the work of the week at #DigiURI on Twitter, or by clicking [here](http://dliuri2013.wikispaces.com/).

I'll be presenting twice in today's events. The first session will be serving as a member of a teacher leader panel to identify "Digital Literacies and Strategies for Change." My materials for my opening remarks are available below.

To extend on that initial work, I will present two "cool tools" sessions on the Use of Google Sites as a Learning Hub. The materials for these sessions are available [here](http://dliuri2013.wikispaces.com/Google+Sites+as+a+Learning+Hub). In this brief time I'll make a case as to why educators need to start to create and revise interactive, informative websites for classroom use.
