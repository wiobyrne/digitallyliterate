# Continued Exploration and Development of Digital Badges

```
TL;DR version: An update in my continued exploration and development of a digital badging system. At this point...it's good news. Scroll to the bottom to review the relaunch of the badges.
```

It has been awhile, but throughout this blog I've had a [thread](http://wiobyrne.com/tag/badges/) that documents my trials and tribulations as I build, and rebuild my [open badging system](http://wiobyrne.com/towards-a-system-of-open-badges-for-teachers-trying-to-use-technology/). I originally started this process by conducting a literature review with a group of my graduate students and then we built and launched our set of badges. We documented everything in the process from the [framing used](http://wiobyrne.com/notes-as-we-frame-an-open-badge-initiative-for-teachers-using-technology/), and down to the [design evolution of the badges](http://wiobyrne.com/design-evolution-of-the-graphics-in-an-open-badge-initiative/). The end result is a system of digital badges developed to accompany the [ORMS MOOC](http://wiobyrne.com/come-join-us-for-the-online-research-and-media-skills-orms-mooc/). You can watch/listen to me [describe the system here](http://wiobyrne.com/overview-of-online-research-media-skills-model-mooc-and-badges/).

All of this was going well until [my badges were deleted](http://wiobyrne.com/challenges-in-launching-and-hosting-an-open-digital-badge-initiative/). :(

I learned a great lesson about hosting and infrastructure, and "[a domain of one's own](http://helencrump.net/2014-09-30/destination-open-weaving-my-own-way-and-building-my-own-place/)" that day. Nevertheless, for the purposes of this post let's just say that the badging community was excellent. A lot of people came out of the woodwork to support and connect with me. I can't say enough about the badging community available [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/openbadges).

**Looking for a new home.** Since this last post, I've been [investigating new opportunities](http://wiobyrne.com/considerations-on-hosting-an-open-badging-initiative/) to host my badges in various spaces. I [built and issued badges from P2PU](https://p2pu.org/he/groups/how-do-i-make-a-badge/) and loved the system. In developing and relaunching the badges for the ORMS MOOC, I wanted to go back and offer them again at [badges.mozilla](https://badges.mozilla.org/en-US/). I know...this is where they were deleted the first time. I wanted to offer them again at badges.mozilla because they have been at the forefront of the badging initiative. I also wanted to include it there because the ORMS model and MOOC focus on developing the [web literacies](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Webmaker/WebLiteracyMap/Align) of teachers and their students.

While attending and lurking on the badges community calls, I learned that there was a relaunch planned for an offshoot of the badging platform from Mozilla. I also learned that my badges may have been deleted earlier because I did not have a "vouched" Mozillians Profile. You can view (and hopefully vouch) [my profile here](https://mozillians.org/en-US/u/wiobyrne/).

**Going back to Mozilla.** After revising my Mozillians Profile and having it vouched by [Doug Belshaw](https://mozillians.org/en-US/u/dajbelshaw/) I started rebuilding my ORMS badges. I'm still looking for more people to vouch my profile so I don't lose the profile and then...my badges again. :) We just launched the ORMS MOOC again, and I have plans to offer it yearly as part of my [New Literacies course](http://wiobyrne.com/revised-syllabus-for-new-literacies/). I'll be sharing more soon about the process of teaching my students how to [teach and facilitate a MOOC](http://wiobyrne.com/come-join-us-for-the-online-research-and-media-skills-orms-mooc/).

If you're interested in joining/checking out the MOOC, you can review it [here](https://sites.google.com/site/ormsmodel/).

You can also review the badges for the ORMS MOOC down below...and possibly earn one yourself. There are a series of five badges…each badge representing work submitted for each module.

- [Multimodal Tutorial Exemplar Badge](https://badges.mozilla.org/en-US/badges/badge/Multimodal-Tutorial-Exemplar-Badge)
- [Online Collaborative Inquiry Exemplar Badge](https://badges.mozilla.org/en-US/badges/badge/Online-Collaborative-Inquiry-Exemplar-Badge)
- [Online Reading Comprehension Exemplar Badge](https://badges.mozilla.org/en-US/badges/badge/Online-Reading-Comprehension-Exemplar-Badge)
- [Online Content Construction Exemplar Badge](https://badges.mozilla.org/en-US/badges/badge/Online-Content-Construction-Exemplar-Badge)
- [Digital Identity Exemplar Badge](https://badges.mozilla.org/en-US/badges/badge/Digital-Identity-Exemplar-Badge)

After you complete all five of the badges, you can earn the Mentor badge. The Mentor badge indicates that you are a leader in the community..and pretty much know what’s happening. As a mentor, you can bring future learners through the MOOC and award badges.

- [ORMS Community Mentor Badge](https://badges.mozilla.org/en-US/badges/badge/ORMS-Community-Mentor-Badge)
