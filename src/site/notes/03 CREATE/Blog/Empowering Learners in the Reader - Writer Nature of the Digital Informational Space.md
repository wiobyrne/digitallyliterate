# Empowering Learners in the Reader - Writer Nature of the Digital Informational Space

Last week my first of four columns as Multiliteracies Department Editor for JAAL was published. The column, titled [_Empowering Learners in the Reader/Writer Nature of the Digital Informational Space_](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jaal.337/abstract) discusses opportunities to move learners from readers to writers in the digital informational space.

The Internet is the dominant text of this generation, and through intentional use it may provide opportunities for the critical literacy infused pedagogy. To empower students using the Internet we need to consider opportunities to move learners from consumers to producers of digital content. More to the point, we need to move learners from content consumers to content curators to content constructors.

As a multimodal supplement to the column I assembled a group of experts and asked them four questions each about the column. You can review the videos below, and click through to learn more about each of the interviews.
