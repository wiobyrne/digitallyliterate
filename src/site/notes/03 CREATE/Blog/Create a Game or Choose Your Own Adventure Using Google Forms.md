# Create a Game or Choose Your Own Adventure Using Google Forms

For the [third make](http://clmooc.educatorinnovator.org/2014/2014-06-30/make-cycle-3-games-make-em-play-em-hack-em-and-most-of-all-tell-em/) of the 2014 Connected Learning MOOC ([#CLMOOC](http://blog.nwp.org/clmooc/)) I was tasked with creating a Game. Due to recent events with the [Facebook Mood Experiment](http://www.wired.com/2014/06/everything-you-need-to-know-about-facebooks-manipulative-experiment/), I wanted to create a simple game that would allow me to satirize the experiment, while educating users. I also wanted to play a bit with gaming.

### Initial planning & playing with Gamestar Mechanic

I started by reading and reviewing the [blog post](http://dogtrax.edublogs.org/2014-07-01/the-clmooc-video-game-and-how-to-make-your-own/) by Kevin Hodgson on the [#CLMOOC video game](https://gamestarmechanic.com/game/shared/196585/b1105829081202a3149a3e558fbccd31) and how to build your own using [Gamestar Mechanic](https://gamestarmechanic.com/). I then reached out the #CLMOOC community for some support, and had a quick HoA with [Terry Elliott](https://plus.google.com/u/0/+TERRYELLIOTT/posts) to share my thinking.

After the HoA I spent some time playing with Gamestar Mechanic to see if I could use it to create the game I envisioned in my head. Although it is a great program, Gamestar would not allow me to create the type of game that I wanted for my "FacePalm Mood Experiment" game.

### Playing & testing other game creation tools, Thimble and Scratch

I searched online for other gaming platforms that I could use to create my game. I tested [Mozilla Thimble](https://thimble.webmaker.org/) and searched online for other gaming platforms...and how to create flash-based games. Thimble and the flash-based tools looked interesting, but I didn't have the time, or expertise to use them. I tested the following tools ([FlashGameDojo](http://flashgamedojo.com/), [Make Flash Games](http://www.makeflashgames.com/tutorials/tut1.php), [Sploder](http://www.sploder.com/)).

I then moved to [Scratch](http://scratch.mit.edu/) to create my game. I searched for examples of "[multiple choice tests](http://scratch.mit.edu/search/google_results/?q=multiple+choice+quiz&date=anytime&sort_by=datetime_shared)" to get an idea of what I could create in Scratch. I then decided that this was more of a "[choose your own adventure](http://scratch.mit.edu/search/google_results/?q=choose+your+own+adventure&date=anytime)" because I only needed two answer choices per prompt. I found and started to remix the following "[choose your own adventure](http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/23316190/)" Scratch piece. I spent some time editing and revising...but then gave up...I need more time to play with Scratch.

### Choose your own adventure and Google Forms

After playing with Scratch, I decided that I wanted to make a "choose your own adventure", but needed a different tool. I did a quick Google Search, and found the following guide created by [Sylvia Duckworth](https://twitter.com/sylviaduckworth).

\[google-drive-embed url="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G7xUe2IQNALsoqZe7uKofyPRu7O2ligqoVckjRNpOa4/preview" title="How to make a 'Choose your own adventure' story with Google apps" icon="https://ssl.gstatic.com/docs/doclist/images/icon\_11\_document\_list.png" width="100%" height="400" style="embed"\]

 

I followed the steps detailed in the provided guide. The end result is the [FacePalm Social Mood Experiment](http://wiobyrne.com/the-facepalm-social-mood-experiment/).
