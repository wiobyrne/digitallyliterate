# Scaffolding students (and educators) as they consume, curate, & create online

The following materials have been developed for my keynote at the [2015 New Literacies Teacher Leader Institute](http://nli2015.wikispaces.com/Home+Page) at [The Friday Institute](http://www.fi.ncsu.edu/) at [NCSU](https://www.ncsu.edu/).

My keynote for the session will focus on moving students (and educators) from consumers...to curators...to creators of online content. The presentation materials can be accessed (and commented on) by [clicking here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wND-M4zHBr-02XiwolH_cwWs7donP6Ky4QUx-Btqi3g/edit?usp=sharing), or reviewing below.

I believe the session will be recorded. I will upload video once it is made available.

We will use [Kahoot](https://kahoot.it/) as a backchannel for the session. The Kahoot I created is available [here](https://play.kahoot.it/#/k/a059fc80-4f0d-495b-a408-c3dc193ace85). I'll share out the Kahoot during the session to provide opportunities for participant discussion.
