# The FacePalm Social Mood Experiment

As detailed in an earlier [post](http://wiobyrne.com/facebooks-secret-mood-experiment-and-the-challenges-of-living-online/), I've had a lot to think and say about the recent news about the [Facebook Mood Experiment](http://www.wired.com/2014/06/everything-you-need-to-know-about-facebooks-manipulative-experiment/) that was conducted (and most likely continue).

As a response, and satire of this I decided to create a game using Google Forms that would act as a satire of the recent events. In a subsequent post, I'll share how I created this game for the [Connected Learning MOOC](http://blog.nwp.org/clmooc/).

Ladies and gentlemen...I give you the FacePalm social mood experiment.
