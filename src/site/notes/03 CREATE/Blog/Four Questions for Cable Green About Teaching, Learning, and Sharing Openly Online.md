# Four Questions for Cable Green About Teaching, Learning, and Sharing Openly Online

Our column on teaching, learning, and sharing openly online was [just published](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jaal.365/abstract) in [JAAL](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jaal.365/abstract). I co-wrote the column with Verena Roberts, Randy LaBonte, and Lee Graham. In this column we share the challenges and opportunities associated with open, open educational resources, and open learning.

As a supplement to the column, we invited in a series of experts to spend some time discussing the broader impact of the details presented. The end result is a series of _short_ video segments of the experts responding to a set of four questions about our column. You can review the video below. At the bottom of this post I share the questions and supplemental materials from the discussion.

1. _How do you define/describe "open", and how is it linked to teaching and learning?_
2. _There is often concern about sharing content and using content online because individuals are concerned about who "owns" these ideas. What are your thoughts about "ownership" and intellectual property online?_
3. _How do we protect the work and intellectual property of educators and students online?_
4. _BONUS QUESTION :) - Why SHARE? Why use SHARED content online?_
5. _How do you see Creative Commons and licensing affecting teaching and learning in K-12 or higher ed?_
