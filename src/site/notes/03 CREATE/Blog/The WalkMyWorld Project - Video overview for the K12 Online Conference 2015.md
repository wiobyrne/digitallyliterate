# The WalkMyWorld Project - Video overview for the K12 Online Conference 2015

Over the past couple of weeks, I've been working and [teasing](http://wiobyrne.com/walkmyworld-video-trailer/) the video I produced on the WalkMyWorld Project for the [K12 Online Conference](http://k12onlineconference.org/).

This morning the video for this session was [released at the K12 Online website](http://k12onlineconference.org/2015-10-20/the-walkmyworld-project-exploring-the-use-of-digital-texts-and-tools-as-a-means-to-connect-collaborate-share/). You can leave comments over on the K12 Online website. You can view the video below.

## What is the #WalkMyWorld Project?

 

Over the past two years, I’ve worked with some of my closest colleagues to develop and present the #WalkMyWorld project. The #WalkMyWorld Project serves two purposes. First, it is an “accidental MOOC” designed to get educators and their students creating, sharing, and playing online as they [create and curate](http://wiobyrne.com/creating-and-curating-your-online-brand/) their digital identity. Second, the project is an open research project. As educators and researchers, we’re playing with opportunities to research, write, and create openly online using digital tools.

You can read more about the project [here at our website](https://sites.google.com/site/walkmyworldproject/), or by following [the Newsletter](http://wiobyrne.com/?s=walkmyworld) I’ve shared over the past two years.

## This video was remixed...please remix your own :)

To create the trailer, I used Creative Commons licensed video content on Vimeo. I used the following clips:

I also used the CC-licensed audio track titled “[Classik Electro](https://soundcloud.com/michel-escaillas/classik-electro)” from DiJi Ano as the music for the trailer.
