# Work Habits of the Digital Native

I recently had the privelege of presenting a two day session to the participants of the [Keystone State Reading Association](http://ksrapa.org/)‘s [Leadership Workshop](https://sites.google.com/site/2014ksraleadershipworkshop/home). Under the direction of KSRA President [Julie Wise](https://twitter.com/readingsecrets), the organization is thoughtfully investigating ways to integrate digital texts and tools into their organizational work flow. As part of this initiative, they have a year long series of workshops and professional development opportunities organized to help them utilize a number of online tools like the ones included in Google Apps and Hangouts.

I presented face-to-face Friday afternoon and shared the materials [here](http://wiobyrne.com/literacy-practices-in-an-open-networked-collaborative-learning-space/). I immediately drive home and presented the follow-up session Saturday morning from my home using a Google Hangout-on-Air. The unexpected benefit of juxtaposing the face-to-session with the virtual visit was that participants were forced to consider the challenges and affordances of virtual conferencing tools.  They were also able to utilize some of the tools I used to support our face-to-face and virtual sessions.

The Saturday morning session was titled "Work Habits of the Digital Native" and focused on the supposed preternatural abilities of "digital natives." My session takes the digital natives debate head-on and discusses ways to support students and educators and students as they use these digital texts and tools. I make the argument that our students are technologically savvy, meaning that they have the toys and tools. However, they are not informationally savvy, they (for the most part) don't know what to do with it. I share the [ORMS model](http://wiobyrne.com/?s=orms+model) and the [ORMS MOOC](https://sites.google.com/site/ormsmodel/) to share ideas for possible classroom instruction.

The Google Hangout-on-Air for the session is available below. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVDZ4ggNJLo The PPT for this session, and the document used for the backchannel are embedded below.
