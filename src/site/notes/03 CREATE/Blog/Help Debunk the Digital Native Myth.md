# Help Debunk the Digital Native Myth

For [Week Four](https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/111619469354411254407/stream/241aa32a-99b5-42fc-bc7f-afabe88899d3) of the [Connected Learning MOOC](http://blog.nwp.org/clmooc/) we were to "hack our writing." I chose instead to hack the writing of one of the members of my PLN on G+.

I've once again been working to debate, or debunk the Digital Natives myth. I believe that it is almost to the point of damaging for educators that want to use tech in their classroom. They start with a predetermined mindset, bordering on defeatism that they're "immigrants" and are not genetically/historically able to work/play with tech. It takes some time to unpack and negate this mindset.

Nevertheless, I took [Doug Holton's](https://plus.google.com/+DougHolton/posts) [original blog post on Digital Natives](http://edtechdev.wordpress.com/2010-03-19/the-digital-natives-digital-immigrants-distinction-is-dead-or-at-least-dying/), and added the text to [Poetry/Rap Genius](http://poetry.rapgenius.com/). You can annotate and comment on the text here at Poetry/Rap Genius...or review the commentary in the embedded selection below.
