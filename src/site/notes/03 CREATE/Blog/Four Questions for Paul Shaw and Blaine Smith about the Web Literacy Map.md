# Four Questions for Paul Shaw and Blaine Smith about the Web Literacy Map

Our column on [Guiding Students as They Explore, Build, and Connect Online](http://wiobyrne.com/guiding-students-as-they-explore-build-connect-online/) was just published in [JAAL](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jaal.381/abstract). I co-wrote the column with [Greg McVerry](https://twitter.com/jgmac1106) and [Doug Belshaw](https://twitter.com/dajbelshaw/).

As a supplement to the column, we invited a series of experts to spend some time discussing the broader impact of the details presented. The end result is a series of _short_ video segments of the experts responding to a set of four questions about the column. You can review the video interview and four questions used at the bottom of this post.

_1\. I let you both introduce yourselves..and your prior work. You basically talk about what you've both done in the past, and how you first connected._

_2\. The column discusses the knowledge and skills necessary for an individual to be web literate in the future. What skills, strategies, and dispositions do you (each) have that you believe are important for the future?_

_3\. Paul, you create and share content online. You're a musician and share your work online. How important is it for you to create, share and participate online? Is it important for you to do so in a way that allows you to reflect on your own work?_

_4\. Blaine, what are some challenges and opportunities that arise as individuals like Paul create, share, participate..and possibly reflect openly online? Why is this important?_

_5\. Is/why is it important that we have students not only read, but write the web? Why should students be building and sharing online in K-12 and higher ed?_
