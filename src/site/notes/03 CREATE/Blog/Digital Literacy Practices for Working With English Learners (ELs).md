# Digital Literacy Practices for Working With English Learners (ELs)

Over the past year I've spent time working with Dr. Martha Castaneda from Miami University of Ohio editing [a special themed issue](http://journals.fcla.edu/tapestry/issue/view/4060/showToc) of the [Tapestry Journal](http://journals.fcla.edu/tapestry/index). The journal is released openly online, and provides guidance for literacy and language educators.

The articles in this special issue of Tapestry provide scholars and practitioners with a set of focused theoretical and empirical pieces that explore current digital literacy practices for working with English Learners (ELs). From expanding the theoretical framework and ensuring best practices are followed when teaching digital literacies to ELs to intervention studies examining the use of digital literacies by teachers with their own students as well as for personal cultural and language growth, this special issue will give and provide the reader with questions to ponder and tools necessary to use promising technologies when working with ELs. Please feel free to use the links below to access the publications.
