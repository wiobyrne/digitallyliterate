# Hybrid & Blended Learning - Modifying pedagogy across time, place, path, & pace

Over the past year, I have served as Multiliteracies Department Editor for the [Journal and Adolescent and Adult Literacy](http://www.reading.org/general/publications/journals/jaal.aspx) (JAAL). You can review the work that we have produced and the accompanying video interviews through [this thread](http://wiobyrne.com/tag/jaal/).

## Modifying pedagogy across time, place, path, & pace

For the fifth column, I worked with my colleague and friend [Kristy Pytash](https://twitter.com/kpytash) to discuss opportunities for hybrid and blended learning in K through higher education. We recently published a chapter on [literacy instruction & learning in virtual, blended, and hybrid environments](http://wiobyrne.com/hybrid-learning-environments/). After publishing the chapter, we were involved in a [webinar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B64yyzedgbM) produced by the [MVLRI](http://www.mvlri.org/). In this webinar, we had a series of questions from participants who were trying to understand the challenges and opportunities in virtual and hybrid learning. To help guide educators, Kristy and I decided to collaborate again and write this column.

In this post, we’re sharing the manuscript that was submitted for publication. Please feel free to review the Google Doc below and leave comments in the text. Please also feel free to share widely. We included submitted feedback in our revisions to the publisher before finalizing the manuscript.
