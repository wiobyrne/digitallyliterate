# Spending a Little Time Making the Web

I recently received an invite from [Doug Belshaw](http://about.me/dajbelshaw) to join [Mozilla's Teach the Web MOOC](http://hivenyc.org/teachtheweb/). The open project is part of the #teachtheweb initiative and focuses on building the skills needed to teach digital literacies and web-making tools in the context of the community and classroom.

In reviewing the initial post by [Kevin Hodgson](http://dogtrax.edublogs.org/2013-04-21/joining-in-with-mozillas-teach-the-web-initiative/)...I also started to think about why I'm interested in joining this work. I'm curious about this work for a number of reasons:

- How can I more effectively utilize the power of the reader/writer Web?
- What role do open badges play in my teaching and learning activities?
- How do planning and scaffolding affect MOOC-type learning environments?
- What connections can I make within this community of learners to expand my own thinking?

I'm looking forward to getting started. Feel free to [join](http://hivenyc.org/teachtheweb/) in as well if you're interested.
