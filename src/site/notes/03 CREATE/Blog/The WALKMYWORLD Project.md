# The WALKMYWORLD Project

```
This is the first post we shared about the #WalkMyWorld Project. To review the full project website, click here.

I'd like to invite you all in to a challenge that I've help develop with an awesome group of researchers. In this challenge, we will explore the use of digital texts and tools as a means to connect, collaborate, and share. This social media experiment first started as a outline for future research that Leanne Drapeau,  Greg McVerry, Sue Ringler-Pet and I wanted to present at [NCTE](http://www.ncte.org/). Now we've teamed up with a global cast of colleagues, and we wanted to invite you in. This latest piece of research is the [evolution of a series of projects](http://wiobyrne.com/social-networking-and-writing-documentary-poetry/) over a couple of years in which we've examined the use of digital texts and tools in poetry instruction and response. We will share more about the poetry "angle" of this project...but first, let me explain and issue the challenge.

### #WALKMYWORLD

Over the next ten weeks, we would like you all to share (once a week) with us a "walk" in your "world." There really are no rules to this challenge. The only real "rule" to this challenge is that we ask that you share this publicly on Twitter, and include the hashtag (#walkmyworld) in your post. We also ask that you share an image or video that captures this "walk" in your "world" once a week. The beauty of this challenge is in _what_ you decide to share. In terms of _what_ you share, there are multiple options:

_**Vine**_ - [Vine](https://vine.co/) is a free video-sharing app that is owned and run by Twitter. Vine runs on your [iOs](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/vine/id592447445?mt=8) (iPhone and iPad) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.vine.android) phone or tablet. You'll need to visit the app store for your device and download the app. Sign in using your Twitter credentials and you're all set to start creating, sharing, and viewing Vines.

Once you sign in, the app will lead you through the creation of your first Vine. Keep in mind that these video clips are only six seconds long...and they loop. In effect, you're creating stop-motion animation. The only real way to learn how to create Vine videos is to create them. You should play with the app and create digital video content. As you continue to create you will learn more about best principles associated with creation of Vines. Also, be sure to ask friends how to use the medium...and search online. You can follow [me on Vine](https://vine.co/wiobyrne) if you so chose.

The following video is a great walkthrough of Vine, and how to create high-quality Vines. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp3XkcSA9mc **_Instagram_** \- [Instagram](http://instagram.com/) is a free photo and video sharing site that is owned by Facebook. With Instagram you have a couple more functions that you would with Vine. Instagram will allow you to capture and add effects to photos before you share them. Instagram will also allow you to capture, edit, and share videos of up to  15 seconds in length. Once again, Instagram is available on  [iOs](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/instagram/id389801252?mt=8) (iPhone and iPad) and your [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.instagram.android) phone or tablet. Once you download and install the app on your device you can create an account. Instagram will not lead you through the initial steps of capturing photo and/or video, but it's not that hard to get started. You can follow [me on Instagram](http://instagram.com/wiobyrne) if you'd like.

The following video is a good tutorial to get you around Instagram for the first time. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsYWVK6g3IY The following tutorial will get you started with capturing and sharing video on Instagram. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btN1\_UkYZ5w

_**Share photos directly to** **Twitter**_ - If you're unwilling, or unable to create your own content using Vine or Instagram, then you can always upload photos directly to Twitter. If you're working with children and want to protect their privacy, this might be the perfect option. This [post from wikiHow](http://www.wikihow.com/Share-Photos-on-Twitter) explains how to upload and share photos directly in Twitter. You can share pictures of student work, or images that you find online. If you share pictures that you find online, please remember to share content that [you have permission to use, or is CC licensed](http://wiobyrne.com/creative-commons-licensing-of-open-educational-content/). Also, remember to include the #walkmyworld hashtag in your post.

### Be thoughtful in your posts

Please keep in mind that in this work you are openly posting information to the Internet. I believe that it is important that we [educate, empower, and advocate](http://wiobyrne.com/privacy-identity-and-protecting-yourself-and-your-students-online/) for the use of digital texts and tools as a literacy. I also believe that teachers and students should think critically about how they [create and curate](http://wiobyrne.com/creating-and-curating-your-online-brand/) their online brand. That being said...I want you all be thoughtful, and careful as you select what to share online about yourself. Please do not post or share anything that you feel does not represent you in the best light. For more information about this, please review the following [criteria presented by danah boyd](“Persistence, Replicability, Searchability, and Invisible Audiences.”): persistence, replicability, searchability, and invisible audiences. These criteria are primarily directed at youth and digital culture, but I think they bear importance for this challenge. In short...think carefully before posting content online.

### Play...and then share

In this challenge, you are playing with, creating, and sharing digital content in online spaces. The key element here is to have fun, connect, and experiment with the digital texts and tools. Be sure be thoughtful and protect yourself as you share online. Be sure to include the #walkmyworld hashtag in your posts. Be sure to [search on Twitter](http://visibletweets.com/#query=%23walkmyworld&animation=1) to see what others share...and take a walk in their world.

We'll share more as people begin to join us. Enjoy!
