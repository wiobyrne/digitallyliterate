# Reflection on Learning Event Seven of the WalkMyWorld Project 2015

We’re nearing the end of Learning Event Seven of the #WalkMyWorld Project 2015. You can learn more about Learning Event Seven by [clicking here](https://sites.google.com/site/walkmyworldproject/2015-learning-events/the-mirror).

This week we examined mirrors in our lives and the identities we project online and off. We also shared ideas about where these mirrors may take us. Throughout history, there is some magic and mystery that mirrors and our reflections have been purported to possess. We all tried to capture that in our shares this week.

### What does the mirror reflect?

This learning event we were asked to use the mirror to reflect on ourselves, and reflect on where we'd like to possibly go. Several of us also used the mirror and reflection motif to consider places that we've been.

Laura Krenicki ([@laurasviolin](https://twitter.com/laurasviolin)) shared one of the mirrors or screens that inundates our lives, and the possibility to capture, and re-tell stories.

Kate Hourigan ([@khourigan](https://twitter.com/khourigan)) took a look in the mirror, and reflected on what she found there.

Justin Berutich ([@Coach\_Berutich](https://twitter.com/Coach_Berutich)) used the mirror to share a moving memory from his past. The resultant post was a poignant event that I'll remember for a long time.

In all of these instances, it was interesting to watch as people shared some powerful moments from their past, and potentially from their future as they shared and connected online.

In our work in the various iterations of the #WalkMyWorld project, it's interesting to see what inspires us to open up and share with others. Part of this project is an open research initiative in which we're examining the decisions and habits made as we create and modify representations of our identity online.

These are opportunities that many view as a way to possibly open ourselves up to attack or injury from others. I like to think that we are creating spaces and opportunities to change the course of conduct and behaviors online. We're creating spaces that are acceptable and appropriate to share, connect, and open up in. I think we need to take a look at ourselves individually and collectively to identify opportunities to reflect and find a better way.
