# Week Eleven - Creating and Curating Your Digital Identity

Welcome to week eleven of the Online Research and Media Skills (ORMS) Mentored Open Online Community (MOOC). The [ORMS MOOC](http://wiobyrne.com/join-the-orms-mooc/) has existed in different iterations over the last two years. This current version is developed as an open learning experience for students in ED 6671 ([syllabus here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18rvWMAKhnbKiSgOalGLXsE1TrBpO62mhvQXV1OeU9SY/edit?usp=sharing)). ED 6671 examines opportunities for the use of instructional technologies in an educational context. We’ll not only discuss _what_ to use in your classroom…but also _how_ to use it.

In week eleven of the ORMS MOOC we’ll start our look at Module 5 of the ORMS Model. Once again, you can learn more about the [MOOC here](http://wiobyrne.com/join-the-orms-mooc/)…and access [the actual MOOC here](https://sites.google.com/site/ormsmodel/).

### Digital Identity

This module we'll begin to look at your [Digital Identity](https://sites.google.com/site/ormsmodel/modules/module-5-digital-identity) as we close up our time in the ORMS MOOC. We're interested in the decisions you make as you thoughtfully create and curate your online educational "brand" as you start to build an online learning management system. In this module, we'll think about how you scaffold students using design elements of digital texts and tools.

During this time period I recommend that you read, view, and synthesize all of the [readings](https://sites.google.com/site/ormsmodel/modules/module-5-digital-identity/readings---module-1) and [videos](https://sites.google.com/site/ormsmodel/modules/module-5-digital-identity/video-gallery---module) as well as the [lecture](https://sites.google.com/site/ormsmodel/modules/module-5-digital-identity/digging-deeper---module-5) that I shared. I would also recommend searching online to find what others say about digital identity. Write up a blog post reflecting about what you’ve learned.

Write up a blog post reflecting about what you’ve learned. What could/should online content construction look like in your classroom or discipline?

### Responding to Module 5 of the ORMS MOOC

During Module 5, you have two Newsletter. Post one is a response/reflection to the prompt on the syllabus and the Discussion and Badges page. In your Newsletter and responses to this module, please be sure to link out to anything and everything that you reviewed during the module. It is suggested that you use Storify to document your learning throughout the module.
