# Week Six - Students Collaborating & Co-Constructing Online Information

Welcome to week six of the Online Research and Media Skills (ORMS) Mentored Open Online Community (MOOC). The [ORMS MOOC](http://wiobyrne.com/join-the-orms-mooc/) has existed in different iterations over the last two years. This current version is developed as an open learning experience for students in ED 6671 ([syllabus here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18rvWMAKhnbKiSgOalGLXsE1TrBpO62mhvQXV1OeU9SY/edit?usp=sharing)). ED 6671 examines opportunities for the use of instructional technologies in an educational context. We’ll not only discuss _what_ to use in your classroom…but also _how_ to use it.

In week six of the ORMS MOOC we’ll complete our work in Module 2 of the ORMS Model. Once again, you can learn more about the [MOOC here](http://wiobyrne.com/join-the-orms-mooc/)...and access [the actual MOOC here](https://sites.google.com/site/ormsmodel/). Each module lasts two weeks…you can work at your own pace. On [the syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18rvWMAKhnbKiSgOalGLXsE1TrBpO62mhvQXV1OeU9SY/edit) it has Newsletter listed as being due this week, or next week.

### Online Collaborative Inquiry

This module we have been looking at [Online Collaborative Inquiry](https://sites.google.com/site/ormsmodel/modules/module-2-online-collaborative-inquiry) and thinking about how to encourage our students to collaborate and co-construct (online and offline) information together. We're really talking about social constructivism and active knowledge construction...powerful learning.

At this point in the module, you should have already read/viewed all (and then some) of the materials I shared. You should have shared your reflection out on a blog post and reviewed the work of others.

To obtain the badge and complete this module, you'll need to think about possible ways to integrate online collaborative inquiry into your classroom. You're the expert of your content area...your grade level...your students. If you want your students to engage in this activity...how would you do it?

For the Online Collaborative Inquiry badge, develop a lesson plan, supplemental materials, handouts, videos, etc. Develop any & all materials that you would use with your students that teach this in your classroom. Embed all of this content on your blog or website. Build and share everything in a manner or format that would make sense to use as a teaching material. This means that you're writing it for your students. Build this as if you would actually use it in your lessons.

After you have built it up, please share it out online. Share it out on your various social networks and in our [Google+ Community](https://plus.google.com/communities/109374663190019101967?utm_source=chrome_ntp_icon&utm_medium=chrome_app&utm_campaign=chrome). After you've completed up to this step...go ahead and submit it in our [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ormsclass) to earn [the badge for this module](https://badges.mozilla.org/en-US/badges/badge/Online-Collaborative-Inquiry-Exemplar-Badge).

I'll leave in below the specific details that I share in the metadata for the badge. If you're thoroughly confused...please ask a question in the comments/questions below. Ask questions in the various social networks. Also, take a look at the work already shared by your colleagues.
