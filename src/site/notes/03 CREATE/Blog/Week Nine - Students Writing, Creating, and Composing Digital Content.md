# Week Nine - Students Writing, Creating, and Composing Digital Content

Welcome to week nine of the Online Research and Media Skills (ORMS) Mentored Open Online Community (MOOC). The [ORMS MOOC](http://wiobyrne.com/join-the-orms-mooc/) has existed in different iterations over the last two years. This current version is developed as an open learning experience for students in ED 6671 ([syllabus here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18rvWMAKhnbKiSgOalGLXsE1TrBpO62mhvQXV1OeU9SY/edit?usp=sharing)). ED 6671 examines opportunities for the use of instructional technologies in an educational context. We’ll not only discuss _what_ to use in your classroom…but also _how_ to use it.

In week nine of the ORMS MOOC we’ll start our look at Module 4 of the ORMS Model. Once again, you can learn more about the [MOOC here](http://wiobyrne.com/join-the-orms-mooc/)…and access [the actual MOOC here](https://sites.google.com/site/ormsmodel/).

### Online Content Construction

This module we’ll be looking at [Online Content Construction](https://sites.google.com/site/ormsmodel/modules/module-4-online-content-construction). Online Content Construction was an area that I started to define in my dissertation and subsequent research. I wanted to create a guide for educators as they considered the skills and strategies students used to write, compose, or create digital content. I labeled this as students encoding and decoding meaning by constructing, redesigning, and reinventing texts.

During this time period I recommend that you read, view, and synthesize all of the [readings](https://sites.google.com/site/ormsmodel/modules/module-4-online-content-construction/readings---module-4) and [videos](https://sites.google.com/site/ormsmodel/modules/module-4-online-content-construction/video-gallery---module-4) as well as [the lecture](https://sites.google.com/site/ormsmodel/modules/module-4-online-content-construction/digging-deeper---module-4) that I shared. I would also recommend searching online to find what others say about online content construction. Write up a blog post reflecting about what you’ve learned.

Write up a blog post reflecting about what you’ve learned. What could/should online content construction look like in your classroom or discipline?
