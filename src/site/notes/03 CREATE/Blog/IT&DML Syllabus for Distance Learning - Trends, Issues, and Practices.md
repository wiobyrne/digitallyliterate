# IT&DML Syllabus for Distance Learning - Trends, Issues, and Practices

This post is part of a series of 11 posts in which we’re sharing the syllabi for all 11 courses in the [Instructional Technology and Digital Media Literacy](http://www.newhaven.edu/4486/academic-programs/graduate-programs/instructional-technologies/) (IT&DML) program. Please keep in mind the materials we’re sharing here are the documents and specifics as approved when we initially launched the program. The “real” implementation of these courses is a bit different as we embrace new digital texts and tools.

### Distance Learning: Trends, Issues, and Practices

This course is the seventh in a series of 11 courses in the in the [sequence of courses](http://wiobyrne.com/course-sequence-for-the-instructional-technology-digital-media-literacy-program/). This course focuses on design aesthetics of your digital identity and learning management system (LMS), or course management system (CMS). In this class we focused on becoming a member of your PLN as you become a leader in online spaces.

### Course Description

This course presents a comprehensive overview of contemporary distance learning technologies, both in the sense of a product and a process. The course deals with a number of theoretical issues and practical considerations for practicing educators and for K-12 students. Students will explore conceptual frameworks, guiding principles, critical steps, current technologies, and future trends in their respective subject areas and curricula. Students will also use case studies that will contribute to the development of an in-depth understanding of the important issues by relating theoretical challenges in order to create strong distance learning alternatives.

### Core Objectives

1. Students will be able to synthesize distance learning trends in order to explain the evolution of distance learning technologies.
2. Students will be able to evaluate distance learning technologies for their use in theirs and others’ learning contexts.
3. Students will be able to connect learning theories with their current teaching practices, using those theories to examine the efficacy of these practices.

### Essential Questions

- What are the historical and conceptual foundations of distance education and learning?
- What design and instruction practices are needed in distance learning environments, and how do these affect learning and learners?
- What policies, administration, and management characteristics are needed to attract and suit different audiences?
