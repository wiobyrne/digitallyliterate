# Video Trailer for the WalkMyWorld Project

Over the past two years, I've worked with some of my closest colleagues to develop and present the #WalkMyWorld project. The #WalkMyWorld Project serves two purposes. First, it is an "accidental MOOC" designed to get educators and their students creating, sharing, and playing online as they [create and curate](http://wiobyrne.com/creating-and-curating-your-online-brand/) their digital identity. Second, the project is an open research project. As educators and researchers, we're playing with opportunities to research, write, and create openly online using digital tools.

You can read more about the project [here at our website](https://sites.google.com/site/walkmyworldproject/), or by following [the Newsletter](http://wiobyrne.com/?s=walkmyworld) I've shared over the past two years.

As part of the [K12 Online Conference 2015](http://k12onlineconference.org/2015-schedule/), on Tuesday, October 20th, at 8:00 AM (EDT) I'm releasing a 20 minute video overview of the #WalkMyWorld Project up to this point. The title of the session is "The #WalkMyWorld Project: Exploring the use of digital texts and tools as a means to connect, collaborate, and share."

## Remixing the video trailer

To promote the conference and sessions, we were asked to produce a short video trailer to start the dialogue about our session. Technically...we were asked to stick to a 30-second trailer. I honestly tried to stick to the 30-second limit. After editing, revising, editing, and tweaking...I got the video to just under 2 minutes. We'll call it the Director's Cut of the trailer. :)

To create the trailer, I used Creative Commons licensed video content on Vimeo. I used the following clips:

- https://vimeo.com/89985047
- https://vimeo.com/93875532
- https://vimeo.com/52288584
- https://vimeo.com/129974823
- https://vimeo.com/108026879

I also used the CC-licensed audio track titled "[Classik Electro](https://soundcloud.com/michel-escaillas/classik-electro)" from DiJi Ano as the music for the trailer.
