# What kind of thinking is involved when you Make - teachtheweb

```
TL;DR version: While "making" online content, I engaged in the following activities: Planning, Generating, Organizing, Composing, and Revising.
```

For the first week of "class" in the Mozilla Teach the Web MOOC we were asked to first of all introduce ourselves by creating a "webby" intro using [Popcorn](https://popcorn.webmaker.org/), [Thimble](https://thimble.webmaker.org/en-US/), or [X-Ray Goggles](http://hackasaurus.org/en-US/goggles/). I chose Popcorn since I've never had the opportunity to play with it before. My Popcorn-constructed intro for Week One is available below.

In reflecting on this process, I was also asked to respond to the following prompt: _What kind of thinking is involved when you Make?_

I've written about this process several times here on this blog, and in book chapters, and for conference presentations. Usually I refer to this as Online Content Construction as I see it as being intertwined with other literacy skills and the CCSS.  Much of this understanding is framed by writing research, and (for me) has a connection to the "real-world" classroom. In this reflective piece I'll discuss my thinking process while Making online content. I believe these knowledge, skills, and dispositions also should be exhibited by students as they construct online content.

When I create, construct, or make content, I see many elements coming into play. Initially I considered the overall purpose, and intended audience of the ultimate work product. The purpose of the piece was to introduce myself to the learning community...and the audience is a collection of global educators that (I believe) are all into working & playing with digital tools and content. As a result I chose to make mine a little more personal and really express myself.

After identifying the initial purpose and audience of the work product, I engaged in each of the following five skills as I constructed, reviewed, and revised my work product. I included many elements from my own work and research in this description in an attempt to provide a research-tested, thoughtful examination of the work involved as students construct online content. _This is motivated by my early years teaching and having administrators think that the kids were just "playing" on the computer._

- **_Planning_ - Defined as a student creating internal and external representations of the content they intend to build and ensuring that it is logically appropriate for the task (Flower & Hayes, 1981).** This initial work was relatively easy as I was provided a template of a Popcorn movie that I could remix and make my own. I did pull various photos, videos, and music from online spaces and saved them on my desktop as I prepared to Make.
- **_Generating_ - Defined as the process in which a student creates or translates initial elements of the digital product based on their memory and organizers (Hayes & Flower, 1986; Collins & Gentner, 1980).** Once I understood how to work with the Popcorn maker, I started adding, deleting, and remixing the content in the template. This took some time as I initially tried to figure out exactly what I wanted to "say" with the work product.
- _**Organizing -**_ **Defined as the process in which a student creates or manipulates the hierarchical or relational structure of their work product (Flower & Hayes, 1981).** During this stage I reordered, added, removed, and (re)positioned content in the piece until it matched the plan I my head that I had for what I wanted to "say" in my piece. I also attended to aesthetic decisions about the presentation and ordering of elements of the content (Flower, Schriver, Carey, Haas, & Hayes, 1989).
- _**Composing -**_ **Defined as the process in which a student constructs the online content while weaving elements from the previous three phases into a cohesive composition that is representative of the goals of the inquiry process.** Once I organized my content and placed it all in the timeline I reordered the various elements of multimodal content in order to tell a "story." I did not intend for the work product to basically tell a story about the last couple years of my life...but in the end that is exactly what came out. I thought briefly about adding in a last line indicating that this was "me"..."up until now..." This last part was not included.
- **_Revising -_ Defined as the process in which a student dedicates time to systematically review and examine with the intent of improving the overall work product (Hayes & Flower, 1980).** Once the initial first draft was completed I left it alone for a couple of hours and then came back to it for a final review process. I changed some elements around, and tightened up some of the transitions. I still could revisit the "final" work product and make some changes...but I'm happy for now.
