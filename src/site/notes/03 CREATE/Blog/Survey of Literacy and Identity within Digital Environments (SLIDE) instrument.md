# Survey of Literacy and Identity within Digital Environments (SLIDE) instrument

This post details and shares items from the Survey of Literacy and Identity within Digital Environments (SLIDE) instrument. The SLIDE instrument was used in research about participant activities in the #WalkMyWorld Project and led to [this research and publication](http://wiobyrne.com/social-scholars/) on social scholarship of educators.

The SLIDE was constructed to collect demographic information about participants. The SLIDE instrument also collected information about the knowledge, skills, and dispositions that participants used as they constructed and shared content openly online. Items from the SLIDE also helped us understand participants’ perspectives about work in the project and the impact social scholarship had on their identity construction, and teaching and learning in their classroom.
