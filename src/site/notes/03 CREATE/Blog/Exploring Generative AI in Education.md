# Exploring Generative AI in Education
## Seeking Your Feedback

As a digital researcher, I am fascinated by the transformative potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in education. The emergence of generative AI tools, which can create new content based on their training data, has opened up innovative avenues for learning and creation. To better understand how students and educators are utilizing these tools and their impact on the learning process, I am working with my students (pre-service teachers) to develop a set of self-reflection questions for future research projects.

## What is Generative AI?

Before we dive into the questions, let’s clarify what we mean by “generative AI.” Generative AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that can produce various types of content, including text, images, audio, and more. These tools use machine learning algorithms to analyze vast amounts of data and generate new, original content based on patterns and information they’ve learned. In an educational context, this could include tools for writing assistance, problem-solving, creative ideation, and more.

## The Purpose of This Survey

The primary goal of this survey is to gather insights into how generative AI tools are being used in academic settings, their impact on learning and creativity, and the ethical considerations surrounding their use. Your responses will help shape our understanding of AI’s role in education and inform future research and policy discussions.

## Self-Reflection Questions on AI Use in Education

### 1. Frequency and Purpose of AI Use

- How often do you use generative AI tools for academic work?
- What specific tasks do you typically use AI tools for in your studies?
- How do AI tools integrate into your overall learning process?

### 2. Ownership and Intellectual Contribution

- How do you maintain your unique voice and ideas when using AI-generated content?
- Describe how you balance your own input with AI-generated suggestions.
- Can you provide an example of a project where you clearly delineated your work from AI assistance?

### 3. Quality Assessment and Ethical Considerations

- How do you evaluate the quality and accuracy of AI-generated content?
- What ethical concerns do you have about using AI in academic work?
- How do you approach giving credit to AI tools in your assignments?

### 4. Impact on Learning and Creativity

- How does AI use affect your critical thinking and problem-solving skills?
- In what ways has AI influenced your creative process?
- Are there instances where you deliberately choose not to use AI? Why?

### 5. Personal Growth and Future Implications

- How has your approach to learning changed since you started using AI tools?
- What skills do you think are essential to develop alongside AI use?
- What potential impacts do you foresee AI having on your future career field?

### 6. Societal and Environmental Considerations

- What role do you think AI should play in addressing global challenges?
- What concerns do you have about the societal implications of widespread AI use?
- How do you view the environmental impact of AI technology?

## Your Feedback is Valuable

I am particularly interested in receiving feedback on the clarity, comprehensibility, and relevance of these questions. If you believe these questions don’t cover other important aspects of AI use in education, please share your thoughts. Your insights are crucial in refining these questions and ensuring they effectively capture users’ experiences with generative AI tools.

## Anything Else?

Is there anything else you’d like to share about your experience with or thoughts on generative AI in education that wasn’t covered by the questions above? Your extra insights are welcome and appreciated.

## Next Steps

Your feedback is invaluable to this research, and I am grateful for your time and contributions. You can email your responses and any extra comments to hello@wiobyrne.com. I look forward to hearing from you and incorporating your insights into this important area of study.

Thank you for your participation in shaping the future of AI in education!
