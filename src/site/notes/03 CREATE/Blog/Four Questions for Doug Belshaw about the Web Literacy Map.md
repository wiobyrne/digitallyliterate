# Four Questions for Doug Belshaw about the Web Literacy Map

Our column on [Guiding Students as They Explore, Build, and Connect Online](http://wiobyrne.com/guiding-students-as-they-explore-build-connect-online/) was just published in [JAAL](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jaal.381/abstract). I co-wrote the column with [Greg McVerry](https://twitter.com/jgmac1106) and [Doug Belshaw](https://twitter.com/dajbelshaw/).

As a supplement to the column, we invited a series of experts to spend some time discussing the broader impact of the details presented. The end result is a series of _short_ video segments of the experts responding to a set of four questions about the column. You can review the video interview and four questions used at the bottom of this post.
