# Course Sequence & Syllabi for the Instructional Technology & Digital Media Literacy Program

The [Instructional Technologies & Digital Media Literacy](http://www.newhaven.edu/4486/academic-programs/graduate-programs/instructional-technologies/) (IT&DML) program is designed for educators who understand that 21st Century teachers must embrace and utilize the technological, cultural, and sociological changes that undergird a differently-connected society.  The program is specifically designed to prepare educators with the knowledge, skills, and dispositions needed to effectively and authentically embed instructional technologies into all content areas, for all students.

The program is a hybrid format that includes learning opportunities that are online, face-to-face...and in-between. We utilize Google Apps for the majority of [our learning management system](http://wiobyrne.com/building-an-open-lms-using-google-apps-and-free-tools/). As a result we use a lot of Google Hangouts to keep in touch, and quickly support each other.

There are 11 courses in the sequence. The graphic to explain the layout of courses is available below. To learn more about the program, please follow the [IT&DML thread](http://wiobyrne.com/tag/itdml/) on this blog.
