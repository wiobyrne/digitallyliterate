# IT&DML Syllabus for Foundations of Instructional Technology

This post is part of a series of 11 posts in which we're sharing the syllabi for all 11 courses in the [Instructional Technology and Digital Media Literacy](http://www.newhaven.edu/4486/academic-programs/graduate-programs/instructional-technologies/) (IT&DML) program. Please keep in mind the materials we're sharing here are the documents and specifics as approved when we initially launched the program. The "real" implementation of these courses is a bit different as we embrace new digital texts and tools. 

### Foundations of Instructional Technology

This course is one of the first classes available in the [sequence of courses](http://wiobyrne.com/course-sequence-for-the-instructional-technology-digital-media-literacy-program/). As such this is a foundational course and allows students to work their way into the theory, literature and most importantly work process of the program. Course specifics are available below.

### Course Description

This course frames the broad issues of instructional technology that will recur throughout the program. What do we mean when we talk about "technology" or “technologies”? What is the social construction of technology? Students will explore these definitions as they relate to instruction and consider whether specific technologies are reserved for certain people, certain subjects, and certain educational ends. Students will investigate what rhetorical work technology performs and where "technology" ends and "school and society" begin. Students will also investigate the relationships between technology, learning, and power, examining the consequences of linking the idea of learning to the Internet and other Communication Technologies (ICTs).

### Core Objectives

1. Students will identify and describe the major theories of instructional technology in relation to instructional practices and student engagement.
2. Students will discuss the benefits and limitations of the various theoretical positions that underlie current approaches to instructional technology.
3. Students will define and discuss epistemological principles and major theoretical schools of thought associated with instructional technologies used in the educational setting.
4. Students will identify instructional technology issues relevant for a culturally diverse student population that includes all aspects of diversity and ability.
5. Students will develop appropriate classroom learning environments that enhance the teaching-learning process using ICT tools.
6. Students will create methods for the evaluation and assessment of learning and teaching using ICT tools and instructional technology concepts.
7. Students will articulate how systematic approaches to instructional technologies differ from traditional classroom-based approaches to teaching.
8. Students will apply instructional technology theories and tools to practical developmental and instructional contexts in a K-12 setting.

### Essential Questions

- What are the effects of e-learning, educational technology, learning technologies, and new media on the literacy and learning practices of students?
- What role does instructional technology play in lives of students as they interact in a global marketplace?
- What biases are there toward the foundations of instructional technologies in our schools, society as a while, and in our own personal lives?
- What research is needed and what are the research methods needed to advance the knowledge and use of instructional technologies?
