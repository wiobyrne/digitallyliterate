# Mozilla Web Literacy Formal Request for Comments

I written [several times](http://wiobyrne.com/tag/web-literacies/) about the initiative underway with Mozilla with to develop and release a new [Web Literacy Standard](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Learning/WebLiteracyStandard). The great folks leading the way behind the development of these web literacies have [released](http://dougbelshaw.com/blog/2013-07-29/web-literacy-standard-rfc/) a formal "request for comments" (RFC). To view the announcement on Doug Belshaw's blog, please visit this [page](http://dougbelshaw.com/blog/2013-07-29/web-literacy-standard-rfc/)....or here on his literaci.es [page](http://literaci.es/where-we-are-heading-with-the-web-literacy-standard).

### What does this mean for you?

You're reading this blog because the Internet is the dominant text in your life. Chances are, you also consider yourself to be a web literate individual. In developing these Web Literacies, we would like to develop a series of standards or strands that would identify all of the parts, complexities, and competencies associated with being able to read, write, communicate, socialize, and build online. To make this the best possible set of literacies, Mozilla is sending it out online for public review.

We've been working on these for awhile. And there has been a lot of thick, rich [discussion](http://weblitstd.tumblr.com/) about the import and impact of these literacies. That being said...we've most assuredly missed some things. To review and vet the standards, we ask that you put on your thinking cap...and get involved.

### Get involved!!!

Straight from [Mozilla's page](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Learning/WebLiteracyStandard)...there are several great ways to get involved and give your feedback:

- Use **[this feedback form](http://weblitstd.wufoo.com/forms/mozilla-web-literacy-standard-rfc/)** to give an indication of what you like, any questions you have, and constructive criticsm
- Join us for our regular **[community calls](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Learning/WebLiteracyStandard/Calls)**
- Discuss the standard on the **[Mozilla Webmaker list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mozilla.webmaker)**
- Tweet **[@WebLitStd](http://twitter.com/weblitstd)** and/or use the **[#WebLitStd](https://twitter.com/search/realtime?q=%23weblitstd&src=typd)** hashtag
- Respond to posts on the Web Literacy Standard **[blog](http://weblitstd.tumblr.com/)**

To drill down into the standards, feel free to review the competencies on this [page](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Learning/WebLiteracyStandard/Strands). Once again, we thank you for your involvement. Please do not review these materials and think "my voice doesn't matter", or "I'm not that web savvy." We need everyone to stand up and let us know what it means to be a web literate individual. Standards and competencies like this will help us educate future generations of digital tiny tykes.
