# Overview of the Instructional Technology& Digital Media Literacy Program

The Instructional Technologies and Digital Media Literacy (IT&DML) program is a Sixth Year Certificate program in the State of Connecticut. The website has some of the info about the program: [http://www.newhaven.edu/itdml](http://www.newhaven.edu/itdml)

Some of the specifics include:

- The IT&DML is designed for people who are current CT  teachers or other instructional professionals.
- The IT&DML offers expertise in authentic and effective use of instructional technologies in educational settings. CT  teachers who receive at 6YC are also eligible for a pay increase from school districts in CT  .
- A 6YC is roughly equivalent to a CAGS (Certificate of Advanced Graduate Study) or an Education Specialist (Ed.S.).
- The 11-course sequence is organized into a blended (hybrid) learning format. This means that most of the classes are online, while others are face-to-face. The majority of the classes that take place during the school year are scheduled to meet online.
- The IT&DML is at the forefront of educational initiatives in the effective use of instructional technologies. As a result, all course materials will be presented as open content and will be available online. The entire program will be implemented and accessed through Chromebooks in the classroom.
