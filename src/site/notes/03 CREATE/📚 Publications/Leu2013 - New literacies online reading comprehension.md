# New literacies of online reading comprehension

## Citation

Leu, Donald J.; Everett-Cacopardo, Heidi; Zawilinski, Lisa; McVerry, J. Gregory; O'Byrne, W. Ian (2013). New literacies of online reading comprehension. In C. A. Chapelle (Ed.), *The Encyclopedia of Applied Linguistics* (pp. 4239–4247). Wiley-Blackwell.

## Abstract

*This is an encyclopedia entry; no formal abstract is provided.* The entry presents the New Literacies of Online Reading Comprehension framework, arguing that reading on the Internet requires additional skills, strategies, and dispositions beyond those needed for offline print reading. It addresses the deictic nature of literacy—the idea that what it means to be literate continuously changes as new technologies emerge—and situates online reading comprehension within broader questions of educational equity and access.

## Notes

*Reading notes and annotations to be added.*

*Note: The PDF attached is an uncorrected proof.*
