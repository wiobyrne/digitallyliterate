# Empowering learners in the reader/writer nature of the digital informational space

## Citation

O'Byrne, W Ian (2014). Empowering learners in the reader/writer nature of the digital informational space. *Journal of Adolescent & Adult Literacy*, 58(2), 102–104. https://doi.org/10.1002/jaal.337

## Abstract

*This is a Multiliteracies column piece and does not include a formal abstract.* The column opens with a vignette about Manny, a 10th-grade student failing school who is nonetheless highly literate online — translating Japanese manga, gaming, and building a YouTube audience of 200 subscribers. The column introduces the reader/writer nature of the digital informational space and argues that educators must move learners from content consumers to content curators to content constructors. It also introduces the Online Research and Media Skills (ORMS) model, built on three cornerstones: Online Collaborative Inquiry, Online Reading Comprehension, and Online Content Construction.

## Notes

*Reading notes and annotations to be added.*
