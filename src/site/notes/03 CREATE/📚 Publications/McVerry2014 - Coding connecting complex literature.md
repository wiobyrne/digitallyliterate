# Coding and Connecting Complex Literature

McVerry, J. Gregory; O'Byrne, W Ian (2014). Coding and Connecting Complex Literature. In *Using Technology to Enhance Reading* (Chapter 14, pp. 130–131+).

## Abstract

*This is a book chapter and does not include a formal abstract.* The chapter addresses misconceptions about the Common Core State Standards and literature instruction in ELA classrooms. It argues that CCSS’s emphasis on disciplinary literacies and informational text does not diminish the role of literature; instead, it can liberate ELA teachers to think more broadly about complex texts. The chapter introduces purposeful text annotation (“coding”) as an active, analytical reading practice and explores how digital tools enable students to extend meaning-making beyond the text through connections, multimedia responses, and writing community participation.

## Notes

*Reading notes and annotations to be added.*
