# Teaching, learning, and sharing openly online

## Citation

O'Byrne, W Ian; Roberts, Verena; LaBonte, Randy; Graham, Lee (2014). Teaching, learning, and sharing openly online. *Journal of Adolescent & Adult Literacy*, 58(4), 277–280. https://doi.org/10.1002/jaal.365

## Abstract

*This is a Multiliteracies: Production and Consumption column piece and does not include a formal abstract.* The column opens with a vignette about Randall, an English teacher in rural Washington who has spent 25 years posting his teaching materials openly online and using Creative Commons licensing to clarify attribution. The column explores open learning in K-12 contexts — covering Open Education Resources (OER), Creative Commons licensing frameworks, and the institutional tensions educators face when school districts want to control or restrict what they share publicly online.

## Notes

*Reading notes and annotations to be added.*
