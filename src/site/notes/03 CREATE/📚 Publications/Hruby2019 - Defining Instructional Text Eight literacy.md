# Defining Instructional Text: Eight literacy scholars discuss framing and trade-offs

## Abstract

In this article, we explore some of the challenges and trade-offs of defining and conceptualizing instructional text. A richer and more complex definition of literacy requires a complex theoretical framing of the “multiple realities” that exist within this framing of text as it exists in educational research and practice. This theoretical exploration is provided by the framing of text as provided by eight educators and researchers in literacy education. Across their collective definitions of instructional text, there are tensions exposed that impact literacy and pedagogy.
