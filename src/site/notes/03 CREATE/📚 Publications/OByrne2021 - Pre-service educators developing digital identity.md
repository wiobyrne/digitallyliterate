# Pre-service educators developing a digital identity

O'Byrne, W Ian; Hunter-Doniger, Tracey (2021). Pre-service educators developing a digital identity. *TechTrends*, 65(4), 444–453. https://doi.org/10.1007/s11528-021-00617-5

## Abstract

This article discusses a study on preservice education students and the implementation of digital identities through self-constructed websites in a technology course. Researchers investigated the process of helping educators create a domain of their own while they consider the role of technology and digital identities in their future classrooms. Data revealed themes that focused around building the website and building a digital identity. The researchers contend that there is a continuum of three stages that exist for students to engage in web literate practices. These stages include being consumers, curators, and creators of digital content. These stages are not meant to be viewed as a linear process, but an opportunity to review instructional practices and literacy strategies in learning environments.
