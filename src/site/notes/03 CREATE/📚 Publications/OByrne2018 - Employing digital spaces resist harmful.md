## Abstract

The intersections between learning, technology, and media are often the scene of tumult and change. The forces of learning, technology, and politics are pervasive in the lives of young people. These contexts of learning are fueled by the current political moment, but also informed by historical contexts that impact our youth, regardless of socioeconomics, culture, race, or gender. Educators are struggling with how to discuss these trends, and their impact on the learning and engagement of youth. This study focuses on how local Charleston activists formed groups, and utilized technology and media in order to resist socio-political discourses post Trump.
