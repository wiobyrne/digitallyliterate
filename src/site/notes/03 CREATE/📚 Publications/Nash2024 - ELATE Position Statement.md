## Abstract

As English language arts (ELA) teacher educators committed to growing students’ passion for reading, writing, and thinking critically, we acknowledge the impact that emerging digital technologies have on educational practices. Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is one such technology that has sparked both excitement and concern. This statement, issued by the NCTE Commission on Digital Literacies and Teacher Education (D-LITE) AI working group, offers ten recommendations for incorporating, addressing, and exploring GenAI in ELA teacher education — framed by the understanding that GenAI platforms are first and foremost literacy technologies, and that ELA teacher educators cannot ignore them.

## Notes

This is the NCTE website version of the position statement, issued November 21, 2024. The D-LITE working group developed this document over two years of ongoing conversation, writing, and productive disagreement among 14 commission members. It was first released on the NCTE website and subsequently published in *English Education* (Volume 57, Issue 2, 2025).
