## Abstract

Digital badges are web-enabled tokens of accomplishment that can contain specific claims and evidence about learning and are intended to circulate in social networks. Unlike traditional school grades or transcripts, digital badges can contain specific claims regarding what the earner learned or did, and detailed evidence supporting those claims. This column explores how open digital badges function as credentialing tools in and out of school contexts, using the MOUSE program — a youth development initiative that trains students in economically challenged communities to be technology and web literacy experts — as a case study. The authors argue that digital badges have the potential to break open existing economies for recognizing learning otherwise not found in information gleaned from grades.

## Notes

The Mozilla Open Badges ecosystem was gaining traction when this piece was written, and I was genuinely excited about what badges could do that grades couldn’t. Grades tell you almost nothing about what a learner knows or can do — they’re compressed signals of institutional ranking. A well-designed digital badge, by contrast, can contain specific claims (you can do X), evidence (here’s the artifact that demonstrates it), and context (here’s the program in which you did it). That’s a radically different credentialing logic.

The MOUSE program case study was compelling because it was community-rooted: kids in under-resourced schools becoming the technology experts for their communities. The badges were doing real work there, not just documenting learning but conferring recognized expertise in a visible, shareable form.

What I’ve come to think since then is that badges live or die on the trustworthiness of the issuing institution. The badge ecosystem never fully solved the endorsement problem — a badge from a credible organization carries weight that an identical badge from an unknown one doesn’t. That’s not a fatal flaw, but it limits how far the credential reform potential can go.
