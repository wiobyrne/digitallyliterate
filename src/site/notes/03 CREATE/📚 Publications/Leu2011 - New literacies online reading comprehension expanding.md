# Leu2011 - New literacies online reading comprehension expanding

Leu, Donald J.; McVerry, J. Gregory; O'Byrne, W Ian; Kiili, Carita; Zawilinski, Lisa; Everett-Cacopardo, Heidi; Kennedy, Clint; Forzani, Elena (2011). The new literacies of online reading comprehension: Expanding the literacy and learning curriculum. *Journal of Adolescent & Adult Literacy*, 55(1), 5–14. https://doi.org/10.1598/JAAL.55.1.1

## Abstract

*This is a commentary piece that does not include a formal abstract.* The commentary argues that skill with the new literacies of the Internet and other Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) will become an important determinant of an engaged life in an online age. It identifies three issues that have become especially important and have been largely ignored in public policies regarding Internet use for educational purposes: (1) literacy is now deictic — its nature and meaning continuously changes; (2) effective online information use requires additional online reading comprehension practices, skills, and dispositions; and (3) misalignments in public policy, assessment, and instruction impede our ability to prepare students for the effective use of online information and communication.

## Notes

*Reading notes and annotations to be added.*
