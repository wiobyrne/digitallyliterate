# Moving Across Screens üåü

Learning Event 6 focuses on the challenges and opportunities of teaching, learning, and assessment as we increasingly move across screens. The Internet has reshaped what we consider "text," expanding it to include multimodal forms like images, video, and audio.

### Why It Matters

Texts are no longer limited to print. Digital spaces now blend traditional text with images, video, audio, and other media. Educators must:

- Help students navigate, critique, and synthesize multimodal content.
- Embrace new media to connect course content with real-world contexts.
- Recognize that literacy is social, cultural, and political, and teach students to interrogate texts critically.

### Focus

**Multimodality** is an interdisciplinary approach to communication that acknowledges how meaning is made through diverse modes (e.g., audio, visual, and textual). Each mode has unique affordances, enabling distinct ways of meaning-making.

For example:

- A YouTube video can demonstrate concepts visually, while a podcast emphasizes auditory details.
- An infographic condenses complex information into digestible visuals, whereas a text-heavy document provides in-depth explanations.

Educators must guide students in understanding these modes and the contexts and ideologies embedded in multimodal texts. Critical literacy asks students to question texts:

- Who created the text?
- Who holds power, and who is excluded?
- What values and assumptions underlie the text?

## DO ‚úçÔ∏è

### Engage Students in Multimodal Meaning-Making

Provide opportunities for students to create and interact with multimodal content as evidence of knowledge construction.

#### Self-Check:

Learners engage with multimodal texts in diverse ways, such as:

- Writing summaries of lectures, videos, or readings.
- Taking pictures of notes, slides, or brainstorming sessions.
- Creating audio or video recordings of their reflections or discussions.

Encourage students to:

1. Use pre-existing resources (e.g., videos, digital texts, images) to supplement learning.
2. Produce their own multimodal content to demonstrate understanding.
3. Reflect on the ideological and cultural contexts of the texts they engage with.
