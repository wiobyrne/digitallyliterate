# LE7

## Welcome to Learning Event 7 üéØ

## Show as Opposed to Tell üåü

Learning Event 7 focuses on using **screencaptures, screencasts, and instructional animated GIFs** to enhance instruction by showing instead of telling.

### Why It Matters

Our learners often engage with digital and social spaces for both personal and professional purposes. As educators, balancing traditional pedagogical methods with effective uses of technology is critical for fostering learning.

Assuming students will intuitively navigate new technologies is problematic. By explicitly showing them how to use digital tools, you reduce confusion and ensure alignment with course goals. Creating multimodal resources‚Äîsuch as screencaptures and screencasts‚Äîprovides a reusable and effective way to train and support students.

### Focus

Digital texts enable the creation of instructional materials that supplement course content. Two primary methods include:

1. **Screencaptures**:  
    Static images of your screen that can be annotated and shared.  
    Examples:
    
    - Step-by-step tutorials for software or equipment.
    - Annotated clarifications of course concepts.
    - Essential questions to prime discussions.
2. **Screencasts**:  
    Video walkthroughs of content on your screen.  
    Examples:
    
    - Providing feedback on assignments via narrated walkthroughs.
    - Recording and sharing lectures.
    - Breaking lectures into smaller, focused segments.

## DO ‚úçÔ∏è

### Create Multimodal Content

Develop and share screencaptures, screencasts, or instructional GIFs to guide students as they engage with course content and tools.

#### Self-Check:

Creating screencaptures and screencasts is simple. Follow these steps to get started:

1. **Choose a Tool**:  
    Tools like [Nimbus Capture](https://nimbusweb.me/screenshot.php), [Loom](https://www.loom.com/), [Screencast-o-matic](https://screencast-o-matic.com/home), or [Screencastify](https://www.screencastify.com/) are excellent starting points.
    
2. **Prepare Your Screen**:  
    Clean up your desktop and organize your workspace before recording.
    
3. **Start Small**:  
    Focus on creating brief, targeted screencasts or chunk complex information into manageable segments.
    
4. **Adjust as Needed**:  
    Experiment with your recordings, and don‚Äôt hesitate to re-record if necessary.
    
5. **Share Your Work**:  
    Save and organize your content for future use. Embed or link materials within course resources.
