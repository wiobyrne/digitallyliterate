## Welcome to Learning Event 3 🎯

## Breaking It Down 🌟

Learning Event 3 focuses on **chunking course content**—breaking it into smaller, digestible pieces. This technique helps instructors stay focused on essential material and allows students to better comprehend, learn, and retain information.

### Why Chunking Matters

**Chunking** involves dividing complex information into smaller, manageable units. It leverages short-term memory by grouping related content into meaningful chunks, improving comprehension and retrieval.

#### The Memory Process:

1. **Sensory Memory**: Captures sensory inputs but filters out most data.
2. **Working Memory**: Temporarily holds active thoughts but has limited capacity.
3. **Long-Term Memory**: Stores encoded information in mental frameworks called schemas.

#### Origin of Chunking:

Introduced by [George A. Miller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Armitage_Miller) in 1956, chunking addresses the bottleneck in working memory, which can hold only 4–8 items at a time.

When working memory becomes overwhelmed, learners experience **cognitive overload**, leading to loss of information. Chunking reduces this risk by presenting content in structured, bite-sized pieces.

**How can we organize course content to scaffold learners while building long-term retention?**

## DO ✍️

### Examine, review, and revise the activities and assessments in your course(s) to apply chunking strategies effectively.

#### Self-Check:

Four stages to chunking information:

1. **Start at the top**:  
    Identify the most important content and use it to create course modules. [Learn how to organize content](http://theelearningcoach.com/elearning_design/how-to-organize-content/).
    
2. **Divide modules into lessons**:  
    Break down modules into smaller, related lessons.
    
3. **Chunk at the screen level**:  
    Present only one piece of information per screen for clarity.
    
4. **Check yourself**:
    
    - Is the information "need-to-know" rather than "nice-to-know"?
    - Do visuals reduce cognitive load?
