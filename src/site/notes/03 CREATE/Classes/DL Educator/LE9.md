# LE9

## Welcome to Learning Event 9 🎯

## Don't Reinvent the Wheel 🌟

Learning Event 9 focuses on **leveraging Open Educational Resources (OER) and Creative Commons (CC) licensed materials** in your courses. Why create content from scratch when high-quality, openly licensed resources are already available? Discover, integrate, cite, and remix these resources to enrich your teaching and enhance student learning.

---

### Why Use OER?

**Open learning** encourages collaboration, networked learning, and transparency by enabling others to reuse, revise, remix, and redistribute educational materials. By incorporating OER into your courses, you foster access, creativity, and connection for both educators and learners.

---

### Focus

**What are OER?**  
[Open Educational Resources (OER)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources) are freely available teaching, learning, and research resources, released with licenses that allow for free use, adaptation, and distribution. These include books, courseware, videos, animations, and more.

**Creative Commons Licensing**:  
[Creative Commons (CC) licenses](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/) provide a standardized way for content creators to share their work, granting permissions that go beyond traditional copyright.

#### David Wiley’s 5 Rs of OER:

1. **Retain** – The right to own and control copies of the resource.
2. **Reuse** – The right to use the content in its unaltered form.
3. **Revise** – The right to adapt or modify the content.
4. **Remix** – The right to combine content with other materials to create something new.
5. **Redistribute** – The right to share original, revised, or remixed content with others.

By understanding these principles, educators can maximize the potential of OER to transform teaching and learning.
