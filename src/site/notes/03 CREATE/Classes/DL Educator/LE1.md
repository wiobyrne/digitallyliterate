## Welcome to Learning Event 1 🎯

## Why Are We Here? 🌟

Learning Event 1 focuses on writing or revising learning objectives. These objectives provide clarity for educators and students by defining the expected outcomes of coursework.

### Why Learning Objectives Matter

- **Learning objectives** are statements that define what students will know or do as a result of instruction.
- They clarify the **"why"** behind your course and ensure alignment between goals, activities, and assessments.

If you already have objectives, use this event to revisit their relevance—especially when transitioning to online or blended learning environments. Engage your students by discussing course priorities and how objectives will guide their learning journey.

## DISCUSS 💬

**How can we ensure our course learning objectives are authentic, valuable, and meaningful for students?**

## DO ✍️

### Write, revisit, or revise your learning objectives:

#### Self-Check:

1. Do your objectives:
    - Identify the _knowledge_ or _skill_ you want students to achieve?
    - Specify the _level_ of learning (e.g., Bloom’s Taxonomy)?
    - Use an _action verb_ to describe observable outcomes?
    - Include criteria or context to add clarity for students?
