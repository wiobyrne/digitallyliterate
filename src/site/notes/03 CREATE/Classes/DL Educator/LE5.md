## Welcome to Learning Event 5 üéØ

## Keep it simple üåü

Learning Event 5 focuses on **effectively and simply integrating technology into your courses**. In today‚Äôs digital society, technology can enhance learning experiences, but its integration often feels overwhelming due to rapidly changing tools and uncertainty about their effectiveness.

---

### Why Simplicity Matters

Start small. Thoughtfully embed one tool, app, or service at a time. Consider these questions:

- Does the technology improve student learning?
- Does it align with your course‚Äôs learning objectives?
- Is it necessary, or is it technology for technology‚Äôs sake?

The secret to successful integration is to keep it simple, ensuring the technology supports your educational goals rather than complicates them.

### Technology Integration

Effective technology integration transforms teaching and learning by:

- Increasing engagement and motivation.
- Providing on-the-go access to materials.
- Supporting learner independence and career readiness.
- Simplifying administrative tasks for educators.

#### The SAMR Model

[Dr. Ruben Puentedura](http://hippasus.com/blog/) developed the SAMR framework to describe four levels of technology integration:

1. **Substitution** ‚Äì Replace traditional tools without functional change.  
    _Example_: Printing and submitting a worksheet.
2. **Augmentation** ‚Äì Replace tools with functional improvements.  
    _Example_: Completing a quiz using a Google Form.
3. **Modification** ‚Äì Redesign tasks to enable new approaches.  
    _Example_: Recording an audio podcast for a response.
4. **Redefinition** ‚Äì Create new tasks previously impossible.  
    _Example_: Collaboratively annotating documents and synthesizing content.

The SAMR model encourages educators to thoughtfully select tools and assess their impact on learning activities.

## DISCUSS üí¨

**How does your use of instructional technologies improve student learning in your course(s)?**

---

## DO ‚úçÔ∏è

### Reflect on Your Technology Integration:

Consider the digital tools you currently use during instruction. Evaluate their impact on student learning using the following self-check:

#### Self-Check:

1. How does the technology or application help students grow in their learning?
2. Does it align with and support their learning goals?
3. Are you comfortable integrating the technology or application?
4. Do you have a no-tech Plan B for challenges or failures?

As [Andrew Marcinek](https://twitter.com/andycinek) suggests, **control the controllables**. Stick with what works, but remain open to experimentation and improvement.
