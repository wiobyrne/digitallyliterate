## Welcome to Learning Event 2 🎯

## Beginning with the End in Mind 🌟

Learning Event 2 focuses on **backward design**, a process that emphasizes planning educational experiences with the desired outcomes in mind.

### Why Backward Design?

Backward design helps educators:

- Identify learning objectives and expected outcomes first.
- Develop a sequence of lessons and assessments that align with those objectives.
- Ensure that all instructional activities directly support the desired learning outcomes.

The concept was introduced in Ralph W. Tyler's _Basic Principles of Curriculum and Instruction_ (1947) and popularized by Grant Wiggins and Jay McTighe in _Understanding by Design_ (1998).

By focusing on the end goal, backward design ensures that students actually achieve the objectives identified in [LE1](https://digitallyliterate.net/le1/). This approach aligns activities, assessments, and tools with meaningful learning goals, even when transitioning to online or hybrid teaching.

## DISCUSS 💬

**How will we support learners as they differentiate what is necessary to know from what is nice to know?**

## DO ✍️

### Examine, review, and revise the activities and assessments in your course(s) to align with the principles of backward design.

#### Self-Check:

Backward design consists of three key stages:

![Stages of Backward Design](https://i0.wp.com/educationaltechnology.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/backward-design.png?resize=1140%2C839&ssl=1)

1. **Identify Results Desired:**
    
    - What knowledge, skills, and dispositions should students master?
    - What are the _big ideas_ students should retain?
2. **Determine Acceptable Evidence:**
    
    - How will you know students have achieved the desired outcomes?
    - What assessments will provide evidence of student learning?
3. **Design Learning Experiences:**
    
    - What knowledge and skills are needed to achieve the goals?
    - What instructional activities, methods, and resources are necessary?
