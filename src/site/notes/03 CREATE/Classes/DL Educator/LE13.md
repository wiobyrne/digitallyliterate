## Welcome to Learning Event 13 (#LE13): 🎯

# Formative Assessments for Feedback and Growth 🌟

**Learning Event 13 focuses on using formative assessments to monitor learning, provide actionable feedback, and adjust instruction to meet students’ needs.** Formative assessments emphasize growth and guide students in their learning journey, fostering self-regulation and continuous improvement.

### Why It Matters

Formative assessments are low-stakes opportunities to:

- Check for understanding during the learning process.
- Provide timely, actionable feedback that supports student growth.
- Guide instructional adjustments to address gaps or misconceptions.

Unlike summative assessments, which evaluate learning at the end of a unit, formative assessments are ongoing and help students reflect on their progress.

### Focus

**Formative Assessments:**  
Assessments that occur during instruction to inform teaching and support student learning in real time.

#### Key Concepts:

1. **Formative vs. Summative Assessments:**
    
    - **Formative:** Ongoing, focuses on growth, low-stakes.
    - **Summative:** Final, evaluates outcomes, high-stakes.
2. **Techniques for Real-Time Feedback:**
    
    - Quick polls or quizzes (e.g., Google Forms, Mentimeter, Kahoot).
    - Exit tickets to check understanding at the end of a lesson.
    - Journals or learning logs for reflection and metacognition.
3. **Using Data to Guide Instruction:**
    
    - Identify patterns in student understanding.
    - Adjust pacing, revisit challenging concepts, or provide targeted support.
