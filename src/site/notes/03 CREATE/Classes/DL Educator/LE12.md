## Welcome to Learning Event 12 (#LE12): üéØ

## Decentering Grading Through Collaborative Rubrics üåü

**Learning Event 12 focuses on the use of collaborative rubrics to promote transparency, fairness, and shared responsibility in grading.** This approach, rooted in ungrading principles, challenges traditional grading paradigms by involving students in the assessment process and decentering the educator‚Äôs authority.

### Why It Matters

Traditional grading systems often obscure the criteria for success, creating power imbalances and focusing on outcomes rather than growth. By integrating **collaborative rubrics** and elements of **ungrading**, educators can:

- Empower students to take ownership of their learning.
- Provide clear and actionable feedback.
- Foster an equitable and inclusive learning environment.

Decentering the educator means shifting from an instructor-led evaluation model to one where students participate in defining and assessing quality work.

### Focus

**Collaborative Rubrics:**  
Rubrics co-created with students ensure transparency and relevance, aligning grading criteria with shared goals and values.

#### Key Concepts:

1. **Components of an Effective Rubric:**
    
    - Clear and measurable criteria.
    - Levels of performance with descriptive indicators.
    - Alignment with learning objectives.
2. **Developing Rubrics Collaboratively:**
    
    - Engage students in defining success.
    - Use rubrics as a tool for dialogue about learning.
    - Ensure the rubric reflects diverse perspectives.
3. **Incorporating Ungrading Practices:**
    
    - Focus on feedback over scores.
    - Use rubrics to guide reflection and self-assessment.
    - Center growth, not perfection, as the goal.

    _‚ÄúWithout much critical examination, teachers accept they have to grade, students accept they have to be graded, students are made to feel like they should care a great deal about grades, and teachers are told they shouldn't spend much time thinking about the why, when, and whether of grades.‚Äù_

## DO ‚úçÔ∏è

### Develop a Collaborative Rubric

#### Steps:

1. **Identify a Learning Objective:**  
    Select a project or assignment for which you need a rubric.
    
2. **Engage Students:**  
    Facilitate a discussion to identify criteria for success.
    
3. **Build the Rubric Together:**  
    Draft levels of performance and descriptive indicators collaboratively.
    
4. **Test and Reflect:**  
    Use the rubric for an assignment and gather student feedback to refine it.
    

#### Self-Check:

- Does the rubric reflect shared values and learning goals?
- Are the criteria clear and meaningful to students?
- How does the rubric facilitate growth and self-reflection?
