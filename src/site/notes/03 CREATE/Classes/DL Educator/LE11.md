## Welcome to Learning Event 11 🎯

## Designing Authentic Assessments 🌟

**Learning Event 11 focuses on creating assessments that reflect real-world tasks and encourage students to apply their knowledge and skills in practical ways.** Authentic assessments prioritize creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving, enabling students to connect learning to real-life contexts.

---

### Why It Matters

Traditional assessments often emphasize rote memorization and recall, which may not prepare students for real-world challenges. Authentic assessments, in contrast, allow students to:

- Apply what they’ve learned to meaningful, real-world problems.
- Demonstrate higher-order thinking and creativity.
- Develop transferable skills that benefit them in their personal and professional lives.

### Focus

**Authentic Assessment:**  
Assessments designed to mirror tasks students might encounter in their careers or daily lives, promoting the application of skills and knowledge in real-world contexts.

#### Key Concepts:

1. **Aligning Assessments with Objectives:**  
    Ensure assessments directly measure course learning objectives.
    
2. **Incorporating Real-World Scenarios:**  
    Design tasks that reflect genuine challenges and environments students may face.
    
3. **Differentiating Traditional vs. Authentic Assessments:**
    
    - **Traditional:** Multiple-choice tests, true/false quizzes.
    - **Authentic:** Case studies, project-based tasks, role-playing scenarios.

## DO ✍️

### Create a Project-Based Authentic Assessment

#### Steps:

1. Identify a key learning objective from your course.
2. Develop a real-world task or problem that aligns with this objective.
3. Define clear success criteria for the task.
4. Incorporate opportunities for creativity and critical thinking.

#### Self-Check:

- Does the assessment reflect a real-world challenge?
- Are the criteria and expectations clear and transparent?
- How does the task encourage higher-order thinking skills?
