## Welcome to Learning Event 14 (#LE14): 🎯

# Leveraging Peer and Self-Assessment 🌟

**Learning Event 14 explores strategies for incorporating peer and self-assessment into courses to foster reflection, collaboration, and metacognitive skills.** These practices encourage students to take ownership of their learning and develop critical thinking abilities through evaluation and constructive feedback.

---

### Why It Matters

Traditional assessments often emphasize teacher-led evaluation, limiting opportunities for students to engage actively in the assessment process. Incorporating peer and self-assessment:

- Encourages students to reflect on their work and learning processes.
- Develops collaboration and feedback skills.
- Supports metacognitive growth and self-regulation.

These approaches empower students to become active participants in their learning journey.

**Peer and Self-Assessment:**  
Assessment strategies where students evaluate their own or their peers' work, fostering accountability and deepening understanding of course content and objectives.

#### Key Concepts:

1. **Benefits and Challenges:**
    
    - **Benefits:** Promotes reflection, enhances collaboration, and provides diverse perspectives.
    - **Challenges:** Requires clear guidelines to ensure constructive and fair feedback.
2. **Structuring Activities for Feedback:**
    
    - Provide detailed rubrics or guidelines for evaluating work.
    - Scaffold feedback with sentence starters or question prompts.
    - Encourage positive, specific, and actionable comments.
3. **Encouraging Self-Assessment and Growth:**
    
    - Guide students to evaluate their progress against course objectives.
    - Integrate self-assessment into reflective journaling or goal-setting activities.
    - Foster a growth mindset by focusing on improvement over perfection.
