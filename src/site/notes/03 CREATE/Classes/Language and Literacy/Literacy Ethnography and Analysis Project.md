# Literacy Ethnography and Analysis Project

### **Overview**

This project asks you to conduct an ethnographic study of a community’s literacy practices. You will explore how identity, culture, and communication shape those practices and reflect broader socio-cultural dynamics, with a focus on race, equity, and inclusion (REI). The community you choose can be from your own life, academic discipline, local area, or another context that interests you. This project will allow you to apply course concepts, analyze evidence, and reflect critically on the intersections of literacy, culture, and social justice.

---

### **Goals**

- **Understand socio-cultural dimensions of literacy:** Examine how cultural identity and social structures influence literacy practices.
    
- **Analyze assimilation and accommodation:** Investigate how communities navigate the tension between adopting dominant literacy norms and preserving cultural practices.
    
- **Engage in critical thinking and communication:** Use evidence to analyze and justify your claims about literacy practices and their broader implications.
    
- **Address REI objectives:** Explore how systemic oppression, privilege, and resistance manifest in literacy practices and propose actionable solutions.

### **Steps to Complete the Project**

#### **Step 1: Choose a Community or Context**

Select a community to study based on your interests. This could include:

- A cultural or linguistic community (e.g., Gullah Geechee culture, immigrant or refugee communities).
    
- A professional or academic discipline (e.g., literacy in STEM fields, digital literacy in tech).
    
- A group connected to your personal experiences or identity (e.g., gamers, activists, local organizations).
    

Consider choosing a community where you have access to gather observations, conduct interviews, or review related materials.

---

#### **Step 2: Research and Gather Evidence**

Using ethnographic methods, collect evidence about the community’s literacy practices. This evidence can include:

- **Observations**: Attend events, meetings, or other contexts where literacy practices are evident. Take detailed notes.
    
- **Interviews**: Speak with community members about their experiences, challenges, and goals related to literacy.
    
- **Artifacts**: Analyze texts, images, or other materials that represent the community’s literacy practices (e.g., newsletters, social media posts, signage).
    
- **Secondary Sources**: Use resources such as the Avery Research Center or academic articles to provide historical or cultural context.
    

---

#### **Step 3: Analyze Your Findings**

Use course concepts to analyze the evidence you’ve gathered. Questions to guide your analysis include:

- How do identity, culture, and communication shape the community’s literacy practices?
    
- What tensions exist between assimilation and accommodation in their practices?
    
- How are systemic inequities, privilege, or resistance reflected in their literacy practices?
    
- How do your findings connect to broader social, cultural, or historical themes?
    

Apply relevant theories and frameworks, such as sociolinguistics, critical race theory, or culturally sustaining pedagogy, to deepen your analysis.

---

#### **Step 4: Reflect and Recommend**

Reflect on what you’ve learned and its implications for equity and inclusion in literacy education or practices. Consider:

- What insights have you gained about fostering equity in literacy?
    
- How might your findings inspire or inform solutions for addressing inequities or fostering inclusivity?
    
- What steps could the community or broader society take to support more equitable literacy practices?

#### **Step 5: Choose a Format for Your Final Product**

Select a format that best conveys your findings and analysis. Options include:

- **Written Ethnography**: A 2000-2500 word paper detailing your research, analysis, and reflections.
    
- **Multimedia Presentation**: A narrated video, digital story, or podcast combining visuals, audio, and analysis (7-10 minutes).
    
- **Photo Essay**: A series of images with captions and analysis illustrating your findings.
    
- **Other Format**: Propose a creative format (e.g., infographic, website) that aligns with your project goals. Approval required.
