# TEDU 325 Final Assignment Planning

Given the goals of the course, the REI international/global focus, and the emphasis on assimilation and accommodation in cognition and literacy/social practices, **Option 2: Literacy Ethnography and Analysis** would be the best fit. Here's why:

---

### **Why Option 2 Fits My Goals**:

1. **Global and Local Focus**:  
    Students analyze literacy practices within a specific community (e.g., Gullah Geechee culture, immigrant populations, or international contexts), bridging local and global dimensions of REI.
    
2. **Intersection of Assimilation and Accommodation**:  
    The ethnographic approach highlights how literacy practices evolve as groups come together, showcasing the tension between assimilation (adopting dominant literacy norms) and accommodation (preserving cultural practices).
    
3. **Focus on Race and Social Hierarchies**:  
    By examining a specific community, students can explore how systemic oppression or resistance is reflected in literacy practices, connecting directly to SLOs 1 and 2.
    
4. **Critical Thinking and Evidence**:  
    The ethnographic study requires gathering real-world evidence (e.g., interviews, observations), analyzing it through social science frameworks, and connecting findings to larger issues of equity and inclusion.
    
5. **Connection to the Avery Research Center**:  
    Students could use resources from the Avery Research Center to ground their work in the historical and cultural significance of Black education, slavery, and Gullah Geechee literacy practices.

### **Revised Option 2: Literacy Ethnography and Analysis**

**Overview**: Students conduct an ethnographic study of a community's literacy practices, analyzing how identity, culture, and communication shape those practices and reflect broader socio-cultural dynamics.

**Process**:

1. **Choose a Community or Context**:
    
    - Gullah Geechee literacy practices and their resistance to assimilation.
    - Literacy in immigrant or refugee communities (local or global focus).
    - Digital literacy among marginalized groups.
2. **Conduct Observations/Interviews**:
    
    - Gather evidence on literacy practices, challenges, and community goals.
    - Use resources like the Avery Research Center to contextualize findings.
3. **Analyze Findings**:
    
    - Apply course concepts (e.g., sociolinguistics, culturally sustaining pedagogy).
    - Explore how assimilation/accommodation, social hierarchies, and systemic oppression manifest in literacy practices.
4. **Reflect and Recommend**:
    
    - Reflect on the implications for equity and inclusion in literacy education.
    - Propose actionable solutions or teaching practices that align with antiracist and culturally sustaining pedagogies.

**Formats**:

- Written ethnography (2000-2500 words).
- Multimedia presentation (e.g., narrated video, digital storytelling).
- Photo essay documenting literacy practices with captions and analysis.

**Rubric**:

1. **Depth of Analysis** (40%): Connection to course concepts and critical examination of evidence.
2. **Integration of Evidence** (30%): Use of interviews, observations, and secondary sources.
3. **Connection to Broader Contexts** (20%): Alignment with global and local REI themes.
4. **Clarity and Creativity** (10%): Presentation quality and engagement.

## Five Potential Options

Five alternative final project options that align with the stated goals of the **GenEd social science signature assessment**:

---

### **Option 1: Critical Literacy Case Study**

**Overview**: Students will develop a case study analyzing a literacy-related issue, connecting it to socio-cultural dimensions, identity, and communication, while proposing evidence-based solutions.

- **Process**:
    1. Select a literacy-related issue (e.g., digital literacy gaps, bilingual education challenges, antiracist curriculum design).
    2. Analyze the issue using course readings, theories (e.g., sociolinguistics, critical race theory), and relevant data.
    3. Present evidence to support a claim or solution tied to antiracist language pedagogy or equity.
    4. Connect findings to personal, academic, or professional goals.
- **Formats**: Written report, podcast, or infographic.
- **Rubric**: Evaluation will prioritize depth of analysis, integration of evidence, and clarity in connecting to broader contexts.

---

### **Option 2: Literacy Ethnography and Analysis**

**Overview**: Students will conduct an ethnographic mini-study exploring literacy practices within a specific community, analyzing their findings through social science frameworks.

- **Process**:
    1. Observe and/or interview participants in a community context (e.g., family, workplace, school) to document literacy practices.
    2. Analyze how identity, culture, and communication intersect within this context, citing course concepts and evidence.
    3. Reflect on the implications for equity and antiracist pedagogy.
    4. Present findings and recommendations.
- **Formats**: Written ethnography, photo essay, or video presentation.
- **Rubric**: Focus on research quality, application of course theories, and critical thinking.

---

### **Option 3: Antiracist Literacy Advocacy Project**

**Overview**: Students will design a campaign or resource advocating for equity in literacy education, incorporating course concepts and evidence.

- **Process**:
    1. Identify a literacy equity issue (e.g., systemic inequities in access to books or digital tools).
    2. Research the issue, gathering evidence and examples.
    3. Design an advocacy campaign or resource (e.g., lesson plan, community workshop, public awareness poster).
    4. Justify design choices based on antiracist language pedagogy and social science theories.
- **Formats**: Campaign materials (brochure, slideshow, digital toolkit) or written proposal.
- **Rubric**: Emphasis on innovation, connection to evidence, and practical applicability.

---

### **Option 4: Media Analysis on Literacy and Identity**

**Overview**: Students will analyze a media artifact (e.g., film, book, social media campaign) through the lens of literacy, identity, and socio-cultural dimensions.

- **Process**:
    1. Choose a media artifact related to literacy or language use.
    2. Analyze how it portrays identity, culture, and communication, using course concepts and evidence to support claims.
    3. Critique its alignment with or challenge to antiracist principles.
    4. Reflect on the artifactâ€™s relevance to broader social issues.
- **Formats**: Analytical essay, video essay, or podcast.
- **Rubric**: Focus on critical thinking, evidence-based analysis, and integration of course themes.

---

### **Option 5: Collaborative Digital Resource on Literacy and Equity**

**Overview**: Students will collaborate to create a digital resource (e.g., website, e-book) exploring the relationships between literacy, culture, and equity.

- **Process**:
    1. Choose a unifying theme (e.g., fostering inclusive classrooms, dismantling literacy barriers).
    2. Each group member contributes a section based on research and course theories, supported by evidence.
    3. Include a reflective piece connecting contributions to personal or professional goals.
    4. Compile sections into a cohesive resource.
- **Formats**: Group website, e-book, or digital toolkit.
- **Rubric**: Evaluation includes depth of individual contributions, coherence of the group resource, and critical use of evidence.

---

### **Common Features for All Projects**

1. **Evidence-Based Analysis**: Each project requires students to present evidence supporting a claim, aligning with the critical thinking SLO.
2. **Personal and Broader Connections**: Projects must tie personal experiences or goals to broader societal and global issues.
3. **Choice in Format**: Flexibility ensures accessibility while fostering creativity.
4. **Reflection Component**: Students reflect on their learning and connect it to future goals.
