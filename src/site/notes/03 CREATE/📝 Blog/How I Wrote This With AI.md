# How I Wrote This With AI

[[03 CREATE/🎯 Projects/🟢 Active/Homelab Series/Homelab Journey Overview\|Homelab Journey Overview]]

This first post in the *AI + Homelab Meta Series* explains the workflow, tools, and messy partnership behind building both the **Homelab** and the **writing process** that documented it.

## 🧰 Tools + Workflow
- Obsidian for note development and version tracking  
- Claude (MCP) for structural feedback and linking  
- ChatGPT for fact-checking and revision  
- WordPress + Grammarly for final polish  
- Digital Garden for sharing drafts and rough cuts  

## 💬 Meta Insight
Reflect on how AI helped conceptualize the “meta” layer — the *director’s cut* — that reframed this project as a study in co-authorship.

## ✍️ Draft Progress
- [ ] Outline main sections  
- [ ] Add images/screenshots from Obsidian workflow  
- [ ] Include credits to the AI model’s suggestion of meta-layer writing

## first draft

# 🧠 How I Wrote This With AI
*A behind-the-scenes look at building and documenting a homelab — with a little help from my algorithmic co-authors.*

---

When I started writing about my **Homelab Project**, I thought I was documenting a technical build — hardware, containers, automation, and workflows. What I didn’t expect was that the writing itself would become an experiment in **collaboration, cognition, and creativity** with generative AI.  

This post kicks off a short *“making-of”* series about how I built this homelab — and how I wrote about it *with* AI. It’s not just a process log; it’s a reflection on learning, co-authorship, and the strange productivity of thinking alongside machines.

---

## 🧰 Tools + Workflow

I didn’t plan this as a multi-model collaboration, but that’s how it unfolded. Here’s how the pieces fit together:

- **Obsidian** — the creative core. Every post starts as a note here. I use it to track drafts, revisions, metadata, and the messy thought trails behind each idea.  
- **Claude (via MCP)** — my structural editor and linker. Claude helps me identify patterns across notes, refine structure, and connect threads that I might overlook.  
- **ChatGPT** — my writing partner. I use it to brainstorm, check sources, and tighten prose while keeping my own tone intact.  
- **Grammarly + WordPress** — the polish layer. Once a post leaves Obsidian, these tools catch clarity issues and ensure the writing is accessible to my audience.  
- **Digital Garden** — my public drafting space. I publish the rough cuts here so others can see the work-in-progress — the thinking, revising, and rethinking in motion.  

This workflow isn’t linear. It’s recursive — a looping, layered process where tools talk to each other (and to me) in a kind of asynchronous dialogue.

## 💬 The Meta Layer

Somewhere along the way, the AI I was using to help *write about* the homelab suggested that I also *write about the writing itself.*  

That one idea reframed everything.  

It turned this project from a simple documentation task into a **meta-level inquiry** — a “director’s cut” of the creative process. I started to see each model not just as a tool, but as a **collaborator with a different cognitive style**:  
- Claude sees structure.  
- ChatGPT iterates and clarifies.  
- I curate, contextualize, and narrate.  

Together, we built not just content, but commentary — a conversation about how humans and AI might co-author new kinds of knowledge.

## 🪞 Why Share the Rough Cuts?

Because writing with AI can make the process *look* seamless — but it’s anything but.  

In reality, there’s revision fatigue, prompt misfires, missing context, and the occasional philosophical crisis about authorship. By publishing the **rough drafts** in my [Digital Garden](https://digitallyliterate.net/), I want to expose that process — not to demystify it entirely, but to show that creative work with AI is still human work: iterative, uncertain, and deeply personal.

## 🔗 What’s Next

This post begins a four-part reflective series on the *AI side* of the Homelab project:

1. **🧠 How I Wrote This With AI** — The workflow, the tools, and the messy process.  
2. **🧩 When the AI Forgets** — What happens when your thought partner loses the thread.  
3. **🤝 Using AI as a Research Partner** — How to treat models as collaborators in inquiry.  
4. **🔁 What I Learned Building (and Writing) With AI** — Lessons at the intersection of building, thinking, and co-authoring.

Each post mirrors the same pattern I used to build the lab itself: design → test → fail → rebuild → reflect.

## ✍️ Process Notes (for the curious)

- Drafted and organized in **Obsidian**  
- Structured and cross-linked with **Claude (MCP)**  
- Revised and fact-checked with **ChatGPT**  
- Final edits via **Grammarly** + **WordPress**  
- Published iteratively in my **Digital Garden**  

AI didn’t *write* this — we *wrote* it.  
And that, more than the homelab itself, might be the real experiment here.
