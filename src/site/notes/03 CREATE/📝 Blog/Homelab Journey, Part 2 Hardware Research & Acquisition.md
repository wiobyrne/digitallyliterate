# Homelab Journey, Part 2: Hardware Research & Acquisition
## Building the Foundation

[[03 CREATE/ðŸŽ¯ Projects/ðŸŸ¢ Active/Homelab Series/Homelab Journey Overview\|Homelab Journey Overview]]

### Core Questions
- What equipment did I start with (CPU, RAM, drives, NICs)?  
- Did I repurpose old machines or build from scratch?  
- How did I balance cost, power, noise, and expandability?  
- What would I do differently with hindsight?

### Drafting Notes
- Research sources or forums consulted  
- Final build list or bill of materials  
- Setup photos or diagrams  
- Early testing / burn-in experiences
