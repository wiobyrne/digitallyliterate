# The Pacific Northwest Tree Octopus Saga Continues

A recent "debate" erupted last week over some research that was conducted during the Teaching Internet Comprehension to Adolescents (TICA) grant by Dr. Leu, Dr. Reinking, and others (Amy Carter, Jill Castek, Julie Coiro, Laurie A. Henry, Jackie Malloy, Kathy Robbins, Angela Rogers, and Lisa Zawilinski). This work was detailed in various publications and presented at numerous conferences over the past several years.
