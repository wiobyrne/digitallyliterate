# 📝 Blog

This is the archive of my blog writing — articles, essays, and posts that have been published over the years. These represent the public-facing output of my research, teaching, and thinking about digital literacy, education, and technology.

## How the Blog Connects to the Garden

Blog posts often draw from the deeper work happening in the garden:
- **[[03 CREATE/🌲 Evergreens/🌲 Evergreens\|🌲 Evergreens]]** provide the foundational frameworks behind many posts.
- **[[02 DEVELOP/🌿 Plants/🌿 Plants\|🌿 Plants]]** sometimes surface as exploratory blog entries before they fully mature.
- **[[03 CREATE/📧 Newsletter/📧 Newsletter\|📧 Newsletter]]** issues often share themes with blog content, reaching a different audience.
