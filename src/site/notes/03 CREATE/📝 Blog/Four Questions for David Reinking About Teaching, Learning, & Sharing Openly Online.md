# Four Questions for David Reinking About Teaching, Learning, & Sharing Openly Online

Our column on teaching, learning, and sharing openly online was [just published](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jaal.365/abstract) in [JAAL](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jaal.365/abstract). I co-wrote the column with Verena Roberts, Randy LaBonte, and Lee Graham. In this case we share the challenges and opportunities associated with open, open educational resources, and open learning.

As a supplement to the column, we invited in a series of experts to spend some time discussing the broader impact of the details presented. The end result is a series of¬†_short_ video segments of the experts responding to a set of four questions about our column. You can review the video below. At the bottom of this post I share the questions and supplemental materials from the discussion.

1. _How do you frame open, and what are the implications for literacy and education?_
2. _I see one of the challenges to the use of online open texts being a privileging of printed, traditional texts over online resources. Do you see these challenges, and how do you see the intersection?_
3. _For instructors, academics, and educators in higher ed, how do you view the role of open (open access, open ed resources) impacting these spaces?_
4. _I routinely blog, and share my work online. There is a debate in academia as to the role of scholars and researchers openly blogging, and publishing their work online. What is your position on this issue?_
