# WALKMYWORLD Curated Content on Storify for Week Nine

For week nine, learning event nine of the #WALKMYWORLD project, we were to collect, curate, and share all of the work that we shared during the project.

Below you will find the elements that I saved in Storify and the final segment where I try to indicate what this all means. Enjoy.
