# IT&DML Syllabus for Digital Portfolio

This post is part of a series of 11 posts in which we‚Äôre sharing the syllabi for all 11 courses in the¬†[Instructional Technology and Digital Media Literacy](http://www.newhaven.edu/4486/academic-programs/graduate-programs/instructional-technologies/)¬†(IT&DML) program. Please keep in mind the materials we‚Äôre sharing here are the documents and specifics as approved when we initially launched the program. The ‚Äúreal‚Äù implementation of these courses is a bit different as we embrace new digital texts and tools.

### Digital Portfolio

This course is the final course of the¬†[sequence of courses](http://wiobyrne.com/course-sequence-for-the-instructional-technology-digital-media-literacy-program/). This is meant to be a culmination of the work completed over the course of the entire IT&DML program. Students are to complete, and revise content on their blogs, and [learning Hub](http://wiobyrne.com/use-google-sites-for-educators-to-build-your-own-digital-learning-hub/). The final element will include a "broadcast" as they present their work over the course of the program.¬†

### Course Description

This course will serve as a capstone or culminating course for the Sixth Year Certificate. Students will develop digital portfolios, defined as a purposeful collection of student work that illustrates efforts, progress and achievement in the program objectives. Students will be expected to demonstrate mastery of instructional technological tools as well as mastery of the pedagogical and intellectual content, synthesizing them into a portfolio that demonstrates their significant mastery of instructional technologies and media literacies.

### Core Objectives

1. Students will create a digital portfolio that effectively demonstrates their mastery of instructional technological tools, as related to education, schooling, and pedagogy.
2. Students will synthesize their program learning about pedagogical practices, intellectual content, and critical literacy perspectives within their digital portfolio.

### Essential Questions

- What are the knowledge, skills, and dispositions necessary for educators to create a professional digital portfolio?
- What information, design elements, degrees of interactivity, and production skills are necessary to design and publish a digital portfolio?
- What is the expected/anticipated audience of your portfolio, the purpose of the portfolio, and what design elements make this possible?
