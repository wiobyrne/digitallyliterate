## What Runs on the Lab?

[[03 CREATE/ðŸŽ¯ Projects/ðŸŸ¢ Active/Homelab Series/Homelab Journey Overview\|Homelab Journey Overview]]
### Core Questions
- What core services did I deploy first, and why?  
- Did I prefer LXC containers, Docker, or full VMs?  
- How do I manage updates and dependencies?  
- Which apps deliver the most value or headaches?

### Drafting Notes
- App stack list (e.g., Jellyfin, Nextcloud, Grafana, Nginx Proxy Manager)  
- Notes on container orchestration or automation  
- Integrations between apps (reverse proxy, monitoring)  
- Screenshots or dashboard captures
