# Storify and Curiosity

I've been meaning to test out Storify for some time now. I finally took the time to sign up two days ago, feel free to check me out¬†[here](http://storify.com/wiobyrne). Storify will pull info from various social network feeds and compile a "story" from all of this. I also plugged Storify up to my account on¬†[IFTTT](http://ifttt.com/dashboard)¬†so all of my Tweets automagically get added to Storify.

In about 20 minutes I pulled together a quick story on the Curiosity rover and the landing on Mars. It has captivated my attention for the past 48 hours...and I felt the need to build something. I have to say that it was pretty cool to cull the various social networks and online nooks and crannies to see what people were saying about the landing.

The final project can be viewed here:¬†[http://storify.com/wiobyrne/the-nature-of-curiosity](http://storify.com/wiobyrne/the-nature-of-curiosity)

As of yet I can't get the embed code working...for now. I think Storify could be a cool online reading and writing activity with a nice critical literacy appeal to it. In a sense you're skimming through online information to see what others view to be the "truth" about a current issue. I'll continue to play with it and share more later. I'll also do a write-up on IFTTT for everyone later.
