# Homelab Journey, Part 7: Advanced Configurations
## Experimentation & Growth

[[03 CREATE/🎯 Projects/🟢 Active/Homelab Bloging/Homelab Journey Overview\|Homelab Journey Overview]]
### Core Questions
- Have I configured GPU passthrough or other PCIe devices?  
- Any automation or Infrastructure-as-Code (Ansible, Terraform)?  
- Am I running local AI workloads or LLMs?  
- What’s broken, been rebuilt, or reimagined?

### Drafting Notes
- Hardware acceleration configuration  
- Automation scripts and playbooks  
- AI model hosting experiments  
- Notes on trial, error, and iteration
