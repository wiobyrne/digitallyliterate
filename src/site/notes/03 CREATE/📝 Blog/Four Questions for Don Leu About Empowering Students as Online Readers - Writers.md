# Four Questions for Don Leu About Empowering Students as Online Readers - Writers

My column on Empowering Learners in the Reader/Writer Nature of the Digital Informational Space was just published in [Volume 58, Issue 2](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jaal.2014.58.issue-2/issuetoc) of [JAAL](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1002/(ISSN)1936-2706). In this column I make the case that educators have the opportunity to empower learners as not only readers, but writers of online information. To do this we need to move students (and ourselves) from content consumers, to content curators, to content construction.

As a supplement to this column I invited five experts to spend some time discussing the broader impact of the details presented. The end result are short video segments of the experts responding to four questions about the implications of this work. Down below you can¬†find the questions and video from one of the sessions.
