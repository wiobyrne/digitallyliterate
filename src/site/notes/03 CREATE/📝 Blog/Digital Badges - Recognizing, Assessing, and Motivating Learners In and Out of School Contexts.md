# Digital Badges - Recognizing, Assessing, and Motivating Learners In and Out of School Contexts

This¬†week my third¬†column as Multiliteracies Department Editor for [JAAL](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1002/(ISSN)1936-2706) was published. The column, titled¬†[Digital Badges: Recognizing, Assessing, and Motivating Learners¬†In and Out of School Contexts](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jaal.381/abstract)¬†provides an overview of digital and open badges in teaching, learning, and assessment.

Digital badges are web-enabled tokens of accomplishment that contain specific claims and evidence about learning and achievement along with detailed evidence supporting those claims. Badges traditionally consist of an image and relevant metadata (e.g., badge name, description, criteria, issuer, evidence, date issued, standards, and tags).

This column features findings from recent research examining the design principles for open digital badges that emerged across the 30 organizations awarded grants to develop badge content in the 2012 Badges for Lifelong Learning Initiative. The column focuses on the principles identified in the research (recognition, assessment, and motivation) on one student in the MOUSE outreach program. Results provide guidance for educators in and out of traditional learning contexts.

We uploaded a pre-publication draft of the column to allow for review, remix, and commentary. Please [click here for the Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mAzcVYdrNCPO1y3IyRRuVwOQ9G7hO59ZGuW1Rz1W8-g/edit), or review below.

As a multimodal supplement to the column I assembled a group of experts and asked them four questions each about the column. You can review the videos below, and click through to learn more about each of the interviews.
