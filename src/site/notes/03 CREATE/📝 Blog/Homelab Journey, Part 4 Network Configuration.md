# Homelab Journey, Part 4: Network Configuration
## Designing the Digital Neighborhood

[[03 CREATE/🎯 Projects/🟢 Active/Homelab Series/Homelab Journey Overview\|Homelab Journey Overview]]
### Core Questions
- What’s my network layout (router, switch, VLANs, firewall)?  
- How did I handle DNS, DHCP, and SSL/TLS?  
- What solutions manage remote access (VPN, Tailscale, etc.)?  
- How do I visualize or map this network?

### Drafting Notes
- Network diagram and addressing schema  
- Configuration challenges (e.g., VLAN tagging, routing loops)  
- Integration with Proxmox bridges or Docker networks  
- Lessons about simplicity vs segmentation
