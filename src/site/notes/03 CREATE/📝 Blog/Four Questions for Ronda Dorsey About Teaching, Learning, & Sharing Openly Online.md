# Four Questions for Ronda Dorsey About Teaching, Learning, & Sharing Openly Online

Our column on teaching, learning, and sharing openly online was [just published](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jaal.365/abstract) in [JAAL](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jaal.365/abstract). I co-wrote the column with Verena Roberts, Randy LaBonte, and Lee Graham. In this case we share the challenges and opportunities associated with open, open educational resources, and open learning.

As a supplement to the column, we invited in a series of experts to spend some time discussing the broader impact of the details presented. The end result is a series of¬†_short_ video segments of the experts responding to a set of four questions about our column. You can review the video below. At the bottom of this post I share the questions and supplemental materials from the discussion.

### Four Questions for Ronda Dorsey

[Ronda Dorsey](https://twitter.com/openarian)¬†is an open education advocate, [self-described](http://about.me/rdorsey) "higher ed improver." Ronda is multifaceted and any attempt that I'll give to describe her will be incomplete. Follow her online, and get to know her. :)

- _How do you define/describe "open", and how is it linked to teaching and learning?_
- _Why Open? Why should teachers try to make this happen in their classrooms?_
- _What effect does this have on student engagement and learning?_¬†
- _How can educators start designing in opportunities to share in their classroom?_
