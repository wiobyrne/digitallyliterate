# Bots, Trolls, and the Future: Why Kids Should Lead the Way

In this digital age, we are surrounded by artificial intelligence and technology - from virtual assistants in our phones to chatbots on websites. While these advancements have made our lives easier, they have also given rise to a new breed of online users ‚Äì bots and trolls. Amidst this rapidly changing digital landscape, it is becoming increasingly evident that our young ones ‚Äì the digital natives ‚Äì may hold the key to navigating these waters.

But first, let's understand who these online characters are. Bots are programs designed to perform specific tasks automatically. These tasks range from posting repetitive comments on social media platforms to mimicking human behavior online. While not all bots are harmful, some can be used maliciously for spamming or spreading misinformation.

Trolls, on the other hand, are real individuals who cause disruption and conflict online by posting inflammatory or off-topic messages in an attempt to provoke reactions from others. They thrive on creating chaos and enjoy seeing people getting frustrated or upset.

The challenges posed by bots and trolls are real and pressing. They can distort public discourse, spread fake news and misinformation, harass individuals, affect mental health, and even influence elections. This is where our children come in.

Take for example the students of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland Florida who were thrust into an unwanted spotlight following a mass shooting incident on their campus in February 2018. These students transformed their grief into action by launching a powerful campaign for gun control laws that resonated across America.

Despite being targeted by trolls and bots spreading false information about them, these young activists remained unfazed. They demonstrated impressive resilience and savvy understanding of social media platforms. Leveraging Twitter to amplify their voices while debunking falsehoods spread about them proved their ability to navigate through the onslaught of bots and trolls.

This is evidence that kids today possess an inherent knowledge of the digital world that many adults struggle to understand. They have grown up with technology, and it has become an integral part of their lives. It's almost as if they have an inbuilt 'digital sixth sense'.

Educating young people about responsible digital citizenship, including how to deal with bots and trolls, should be a priority. They need to be aware of the potential risks and how to protect themselves online. But equally, they should be encouraged to use their digital skills for positive change.

It is clear that children are capable of leading the way in our increasingly digitized world. They are born into a reality where technology is deeply woven into the fabric of their everyday lives, and as such, they navigate it with a level of ease and familiarity that many adults lack. 

Children today are not only tech-savvy users but also creative innovators and problem solvers who can use digital tools to make meaningful contributions to society. It is essential that we nurture this potential and equip them with the necessary skills to be successful in the digital age.

In this effort, educational institutions play a crucial role. Schools need to move beyond traditional teaching methods and integrate technology into their curriculum in a way that fosters creativity, critical thinking, collaboration and communication. This will not only prepare students for future jobs but also empower them to become active contributors to their communities.

Moreover, it is important to bridge the digital divide by ensuring equal access to technology for all children, regardless of their socioeconomic background. This involves investing in infrastructure, providing affordable internet access and offering training programs for both students and teachers.

As we move further into the 21st century, let us remember that our children are not just passive consumers of technology but active creators who hold the key to our digital future. We must provide them with the opportunities they need to thrive in this new reality.
