# IT&DML Syllabus for Online Content Construction & Remixing

This post is part of a series of 11 posts in which we‚Äôre sharing the syllabi for all 11 courses in the¬†[Instructional Technology and Digital Media Literacy](http://www.newhaven.edu/4486/academic-programs/graduate-programs/instructional-technologies/)¬†(IT&DML) program. Please keep in mind the materials we‚Äôre sharing here are the documents and specifics as approved when we initially launched the program. The ‚Äúreal‚Äù implementation of these courses is a bit different as we embrace new digital texts and tools.

### Online Content Construction &¬†Remixing

This course is the tenth¬†in a series of 11 courses in the¬†in the¬†[sequence of courses](http://wiobyrne.com/course-sequence-for-the-instructional-technology-digital-media-literacy-program/). This course is meant to be a "fun" course in which students play, explore, and write/construct/remix online texts. This class is at the end of the sequence because we believe students need the full wealth of experiences in the program before they go online to fully create, and push their boundaries when considering the reader/writer nature of remix and mash-up culture. ¬†The class is framed around Online Content Construction (OCC). OCC is a cornerstone that I developed in my dissertation, and have continued to unpack and describe in subsequent writings and research.

### Course Description

Online content construction (OCC) is a process by which K-12 students construct and redesign knowledge by actively encoding and decoding meaning on the world through the use of ever shifting multimodal convergent media production tools. Remixing, or mashups call for a rearrangement, or reconstruction of online content that is already available online and constructed by others. This allows individuals to provide social commentary or critique what is considered ‚Äútruth‚Äù online. When guided by Critical Literacy and New Literacies frameworks they allow for activism on the part of the individual.

OCC will give students opportunities to learn powerful new tools for teaching and learning by combining technologies such as video, audio, graphics, interactivity, and text. Students in this course will learn how to identify, choose, plan for, construct, and integrate online content into instruction. Students will be able to identify and evaluate multimodal resources (e.g. authoring tools, educational software, Internet sites), be able to incorporate online content into instruction, know operations of hardware and software that support media (e.g. Digital cameras, digital video, scanners, authoring tools, presentation tools), and know legal and ethical issues associated with convergent media tools and production.

### Core Objectives

1. Students will be able to identify, select and use appropriate convergent media tools to construct online content for teaching and learning in their classrooms.
2. Students will be able to identify and evaluate software and hardware for appropriate classroom use.
3. Students will debate and critique the ethical and legal issues associated with online content construction in and out of their educational settings.
4. Students will evaluate the affordances of the various online content construction tools and determine the most appropriate for use with students and other educators.
5. Students will construct and implement rubrics used to assess multimodal and convergent media productions in an educational context.

### Essential Questions

- What are the knowledge, skills, and dispositions students use as they plan out, and construct online content?
- What affordances are given to students as they remix, or mash-up existing online content?
- What instructional methods can be used to scaffold students as they construct online content?
