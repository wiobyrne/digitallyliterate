# Preparing for the MA NLI 2012

We are quickly approaching the week of festivities for the Massachusetts New Literacies Institute 2012.

For those of you that are unaware, we bring in 100 teachers from all over the State, and 10 teacher leaders. The week is a gigantic workshop/conference/professional development extravaganza. We have a great schedule of keynotes, digging deeper sessions, and focused trainings on various digital texts and tools (DT&T) that teachers of all grade levels...and all content areas should be able to use in their classroom.

The website for the MA NLI 2012 is [http://mnli12.wikispaces.com/](http://mnli12.wikispaces.com/)

I'm hard at work right now preparing my materials for my DT&T sessions. I will be presenting on Evernote, iMovie, and Pedagogical uses for Twitter.

Feel free to check out the work so far, and use the materials I've pulled together for my Evernote session: [http://mnli12.wikispaces.com/Evernote](http://mnli12.wikispaces.com/Evernote)

We hope to have a healthy Twitter back-channel running, so follow us at [#mnli12](https://twitter.com/#!/search/realtime/%23mnli12)

We also will be looking to videotape as many sessions as we have hands...and post these to our YouTube Channel: [http://www.youtube.com/user/MNLIvideos](http://www.youtube.com/user/MNLIvideos)

If you're a teacher in MA, and would love to learn new ways to use your iPads, computers, and Web 2.0 tools in your classroom...we still have seats available. Please visit the [registration page](http://mnli12.wikispaces.com/Registration) if you're interested in attending.
