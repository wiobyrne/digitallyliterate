# Four Questions for Kathryn Kennedy about hybrid & blended learning in education

Our column on [Hybrid & Blended Learning: Modifying pedagogy across time, place, path, & pace](http://wiobyrne.com/hybrid-blended-learning-modifying-pedagogy-across-time-place-path-and-pace/) was just published in [JAAL](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jaal.463/abstract). I co-wrote the column with¬†[Kristy Pytash](https://twitter.com/kpytash).

As a supplement to the column, we invited a series of experts to spend some time discussing the broader impact of the details presented. The end result is a series of¬†_short_¬†video segments of the experts responding to a set of four questions about the column. You can review the video interview and four questions used at the bottom of this post.
