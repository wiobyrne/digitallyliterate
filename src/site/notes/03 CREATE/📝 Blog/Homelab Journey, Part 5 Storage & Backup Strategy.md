## Building for Resilience

[[03 CREATE/ðŸŽ¯ Projects/ðŸŸ¢ Active/Homelab Series/Homelab Journey Overview\|Homelab Journey Overview]]
### Core Questions
- How did I design redundancy (ZFS, RAID, etc.)?  
- Whatâ€™s my backup workflow and retention policy?  
- Have I tested restores or disaster recovery?  
- How do I handle offsite or cloud backups?

### Drafting Notes
- Architecture diagrams for backup flow  
- Experience with Proxmox Backup Server or alternatives  
- Reflections on data loss or near-misses  
- Automations for snapshots and cleanup
