# Application for the Web Literacy Ninja Badge - Donatello of the Web Lit Ninja Turtles

This page serves as my application for the Web Literacy Ninja Badge as offered by [Doug Belshaw](https://plus.google.com/105664854995907257058/posts/MEpb4B6KuJ6). The badge, and the requisite criteria are available [here](http://badges.p2pu.org/en/badge/view/402/). To review my work to submit for this open badge I consulted the Web Lit Map available [here](https://webmaker.org/literacy) and pasted in the descriptors below.

I am applying for this meta level badge, and have titled my badge the "Donatello of the Web Lit Ninja Turtles." In this submission I look to earn the open badge as having reached the highest level of Web Literacy-dom. I would also like to engage others to join me on this quest and help reunite the TMNT of Web Lit.

I think that I'm still thinking, learning, building, and breaking in online spaces. I'll continue to do so until I die, or the FCC/MPAA/RIAA breaks the Internet for good.
