# Safeguarding Your Digital World Creating a Personal Threat Model

When it comes to cybersecurity, thereâ€™s no one-size-fits-all solution. We use technology differently, and we each have different risks to consider. That's why it's helpful to **create a personal threat model**.

Creating a personal threat model isn't just for cybersecurity professionals or the paranoid. It's a practical exercise that helps anyone identify and address their unique digital risks. This comprehensive guide will walk you through the process of developing your own threat model to better protect what matters most.

## Whatâ€™s a threat model?

A [threat model](https://initiativeforliteracy.org/uderstanding-your-personal-threat-model/) is a personalized assessment of potential risks to privacy and security based on individual circumstances and vulnerabilities.

A threat model is a list of the most probable threats to your security and privacy endeavors. Since it's impossible to protect yourself against **every** attack, you should focus on theÂ **most probable** threats, [explains Privacy Guides](https://www.privacyguides.org/en/basics/threat-modeling/).

Itâ€™s a simple way to figure out:

- What do you want to protect?
    
- Who do you want to protect it from?
    
- How much effort are you willing to put into protecting it?
    

In other words, it's about **thinking smarter**, not just working harder.

## Creating Your Own Threat Model

Creating a personal threat model empowers you to take control of your digital security methodically and informally. Rather than reacting to security fears or implementing random protections, you can focus your efforts where they matter most for your unique situation.

Assessing your digital risks requires a systematic analysis of your digital footprint and potential vulnerabilities. Here's how to approach this process:

### Assess Your Personal Digital Risks

#### Step 1: What do you want to protect?

To create your personal threat model, start by listing the important things you use and store digitally. Think about:

- **Accounts** (Email, banking, social media, work accounts)
    
- **Personal information** (Your Social Security number, driver's license, medical records)
    
- **Photos and documents** (Family photos, important work files)
    
- **Devices** (Phone, laptop, tablet)
    

ðŸ“‹ **Tip:** Focus first on the stuff that would hurt the most if it got stolen, lost, or exposed. For each asset, consider where it's stored, who has access to it, and what currently prevents others from accessing it

#### Step 2: Who are you protecting it from?

Different people face different threats. Ask yourself:

- Am I mainly worried about **hackers** looking for easy targets?
    
- Am I concerned about **companies** collecting too much data?
    
- Am I at risk from **someone I know** (like an ex-partner)?
    
- Am I worried about **government surveillance**?
    

ðŸ“‹ **Tip:** After identifying your assets, consider what threats they might face. Knowing who might want your information helps you decide what to focus on.

#### Step 3: How bad would it be if it happened?

Not everything needs the same level of protection.  
Think about:

- Would this be **annoying**, **very stressful**, or a **major disaster**?
    
- Could it cost you **money**, **reputation**, or **personal safety**?
    

ðŸ“‹ **Tip:** This helps you prioritize where to spend your time and energy. This helps you focus your efforts where they'll have the most benefit.Â This is why prioritization is essential.

#### Step 4: How much effort are you willing to make?

Letâ€™s be real, perfect security takes work. Youâ€™ll need to balance **convenience** and **protection**. Ask yourself:

- Am I willing to use two-factor authentication (even if it's a little slower)?
    
- Can I manage using a password manager?
    
- Will I back up my data regularly?
    

**ðŸ“‹** **Tip:** It is simply not possible to defend yourself against every conceivable threat, and even attempting such a task would make using the internet all but impossible. Small steps still make a big difference.

### Document Your Findings

Your digital security is a journey, not a destination. By developing and regularly updating your personal threat model, you confidently build the adaptability needed to face evolving digital risks. Creating an effective threat model requires clarity about what you're protecting and who your adversaries might be.

Create [a simple document](https://microsoft.github.io/code-with-engineering-playbook/security/threat-modelling-example/) (chart, table, flowchart, or map) that connects your assets to threats, likelihood, impact, and planned mitigations. This document becomes your personal security roadmap. You can keep this note offline, and perhaps use pen and paper if that works best for you.

This pragmatic approach acknowledges that perfect security is unattainableâ€”the goal instead is to identify and prioritize the most relevant risks.

### Implement Your Personal Threat Model

Once you've developed your threat model, it's time to put it into action:

- **Prioritize Your Security Measures.** Focus on addressing high-impact, high-likelihood threats first. The same principle applies to your personal digital securityâ€”build good practices from the ground up.
- **Select Appropriate Tools and Techniques.** Based on your threat assessment, select security tools that address your specific needs. These might include using a password manager, enabling two-factor authentication, or using encrypted messaging apps.
- **Balance Security and Usability.** Balancing security, privacy, and usability is one of the first and most difficult tasks you'll face on your privacy journey. The more secure something is, the more restricting or inconvenient it generally is.
- **Regular Review and Updates**. Schedule regular reviews of your threat model, especially after significant life changes or when new technologies enter your digital ecosystem.

## Final Thought

By understanding what you're protecting, who you're protecting it from, and how determined those adversaries might be, you can build a security strategy that's both effective and sustainable. Focusing on the threats that matter to you narrows down your thinking about the protection you need, so you can choose the tools that are right for the job. A recognition of trade-offs is vital.Â Your threat model should be realistic about what measures you're actually willing to implement in your daily life.

Building a personal threat model isnâ€™t about being paranoid. Itâ€™s about thinking about the digital breadcrumbs you leave behind as you work and interact.Â Even a little planning now can save you a lot of stress later. Start small, stay consistent, and stay safe out there.
