# Digitally Literate Episode 004 - Writing and Publishing Openly Online

Yesterday we held the fourth episode of Digitally Literate. The show is a "monthly", hour-long netcast that we produce using a Google Hangout-on-Air. The Digitally Literate show focuses on ‚Äúmeta-level‚Äù issues associated with literacy, education, and (sometimes) technology. The goal is to produce a discussion forum in which a panel of experts discuss challenges and opportunities that exist in these intersections within teaching and learning. In this dialogue we try to provide some context for smart and savvy educators and students.

### Writing and Publishing Openly Online

This episode examines the opportunities and challenges that exist as we write and publish openly online. In [previous episodes](http://wiobyrne.com/tag/digitally-literate/) we took an initial look at the "[open attitude](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNuC2L_T4K8)" and [teaching & learning in the open](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGN11Ja7DJk). In this episode we dive into what happens as we write and publish openly online. We were joined by [Doug Belshaw](https://plus.google.com/u/0/+DougBelshaw/posts), [Gideon Burton](https://plus.google.com/u/0/+GideonBurton/posts), [Rick Ferdig](https://plus.google.com/u/0/101498776003848694475/posts), [Charlotte Pierce](https://plus.google.com/u/0/+CharlottePierce/posts), [Kristy Pytash](https://plus.google.com/u/0/115685637740131195273/posts), and [Verena Roberts](https://plus.google.com/u/0/108390509469829218014/posts).
