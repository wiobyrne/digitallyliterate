# Tools I‚Äôm Using to Build My Digital Garden

When I set out to create my digital garden, I knew I needed tools that would support flexibility, interconnection, and growth. After experimenting with various platforms and workflows, I landed on **Obsidian** as the backbone of this project. In this post, I‚Äôll share why I chose Obsidian, the key plugins and tools I‚Äôm using, and some tips to help you get started.

### Why I Chose Obsidian

Obsidian is a powerful, markdown-based note-taking tool that allows you to create a local, interlinked network of notes. Here‚Äôs why it‚Äôs a perfect fit for building a digital garden:

1. **Control and Ownership**
    
    - My notes are stored locally as markdown files, giving me complete control over my content.
        
    - I can back up, move, or share my notes without being tied to a proprietary platform.
        
2. **Interconnected Notes**
    
    - Obsidian makes it easy to link ideas together, creating a web of related content that grows organically over time.
        
    - This aligns perfectly with the non-linear, evolving nature of a digital garden.
        
3. **Powerful Customization**
    
    - With its community plugins and themes, I can customize Obsidian to fit my workflow and needs.
        
4. **Scalable Workflow**
    
    - Whether I‚Äôm adding quick ideas (seeds) or fully developed concepts (evergreens), Obsidian supports content at every stage.

### The Tools and Plugins I‚Äôm Using

Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the tools and plugins I‚Äôve incorporated into my Obsidian workflow to build and publish my digital garden:

#### **1. Core Obsidian Setup**

- **Obsidian Sync**: For syncing notes across devices securely.
    
- **Markdown Notes**: The foundation of my digital garden‚Äîplain text files are fast, portable, and future-proof.
    

#### **2. Key Plugins**

- **Obsidian Canvas**: Great for visualizing ideas and brainstorming connections between notes.
    
- **Dataview**: Allows me to query and display notes dynamically (e.g., show all seeds, plants, or evergreens in specific folders).
    
- **Templater**: I use this for note templates to ensure consistency. My templates include seeds (early-stage ideas), plants (developing ideas), and evergreens (polished concepts).
    
- **Backlinks** (Core Feature): This lets me easily see where ideas are connected across my notes, building a web of interconnected thoughts.
    
- **Digital Garden Plugin**: This is what I use to publish my notes directly to my website. It‚Äôs seamless and requires minimal technical setup.
    

#### **3. Supporting Tools**

- **Readwise**: For syncing highlights and notes from books, articles, and podcasts directly into Obsidian.
    
- **GitHub**: To manage and publish my digital garden. It connects with the Digital Garden plugin for easy updates.
    
- **Visual Studio Code**: Sometimes I use this for markdown cleanup and larger organizational tasks.

### How These Tools Support My Workflow

The beauty of this setup is how well the tools complement one another. Here‚Äôs how they support my goals:

1. **Organizing Ideas**
    
    - My notes are organized into stages: **Seeds** (ideas), **Plants** (developing), and **Evergreens** (refined thoughts).
        
    - I use Templater to quickly create new notes with consistent formatting.
        
2. **Building Connections**
    
    - Backlinks and Dataview help me identify and explore relationships between notes. For example, a note on digital literacy might connect to a specific newsletter, book highlight, or blog post idea.
        
3. **Publishing Seamlessly**
    
    - The Digital Garden plugin allows me to push notes to my website with just a few clicks.
        
    - Markdown simplicity ensures my content remains clean, readable, and easy to manage.
        
4. **Repurposing Content**
    
    - Readwise helps me bring in highlights and quotes, which I can easily repurpose into blog posts, newsletters, or new digital garden entries.

### Tips for Getting Started

If you‚Äôre inspired to start your own digital garden, here are a few tips to help you:

1. **Start Small**
    
    - Focus on a handful of ideas or notes to begin with. It‚Äôs better to start small and grow over time.
        
2. **Use Templates**
    
    - Consistent templates for different stages of notes (like seeds, plants, and evergreens) will help you stay organized.
        
3. **Embrace Imperfection**
    
    - A digital garden is always evolving. Don‚Äôt feel pressured to publish perfectly polished content.
        
4. **Leverage Backlinks**
    
    - Whenever you create a new note, think about how it connects to existing ideas.
        
5. **Experiment with Tools**
    
    - Obsidian is incredibly flexible. Play around with plugins and workflows until you find what works best for you.

### What‚Äôs Next?

This week, I‚Äôll record two videos to walk you through this process:

1. **How to Set Up Obsidian**: A step-by-step guide for anyone new to the tool.
    
2. **A Tour of My Obsidian Vault**: An inside look at how I organize my notes and workflows.
    

I may include these videos here or share them as standalone resources‚Äîlet me know what you‚Äôd find most helpful!

In the next blog post, I‚Äôll dive into how I‚Äôm designing the structure of my digital garden, including how I organize notes, create connections, and plan for future growth. If you‚Äôre building along with me, I‚Äôd love to hear how you‚Äôre approaching your own setup.

Let‚Äôs keep cultivating ideas together‚Äîone note at a time.
