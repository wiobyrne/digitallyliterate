# Children give you the opportunity to face life

Children give you the opportunity to face life. Life is hard. With children, there is no longer a focus on self


---

Every day, we wake up and face the world. This world, while filled with beauty and wonder, is also filled with hardships and challenges. Life, as we know it, is hard. It throws curveballs at you when you least expect them and tests your mettle in ways that you could never have imagined.

But there‚Äôs something that has the potential to change our perspective towards life - children. When we become parents, our lives undergo a complete transformation. Suddenly, there's a little person who's wholly dependent on us for their survival. This new responsibility can be daunting but it also gives us an opportunity to face life in a whole new way.

When you have children, your focus shifts from yourself to them. Your priorities change, your perspectives broaden and you're forced out of your comfort zone. Your personal desires and needs often take a back seat as the needs of your child take precedence.

This shift doesn't mean that you lose yourself or give up on your dreams or aspirations; instead it means that you learn to balance things out in a better way. You learn to be more patient, more understanding and more resilient. You learn to appreciate the little moments of joy amidst the chaos of parenting - that infectious laughter of your child, their first word or their innocent questions about life.

At times it may feel like an uphill task - managing work commitments while ensuring that your children are well taken care of; dealing with sleepless nights and mountains of laundry; handling tantrums while trying to keep calm yourself.

But amidst all these trials comes immense growth. Children push us beyond our known boundaries ‚Äì they help us discover strengths we never knew we had; they teach us lessons about life that no book or teacher ever could. They help us understand what empathy truly means when comforting them after a nightmare or when they fall down scraping their knee.

Children remind us to live in the moment. In their world, there's no worry about the past or the future, just the joy of the present. They teach us to find happiness in simple things ‚Äì a beautiful sunset, a butterfly fluttering by or a rainbow after a rain. 

With children, life is unpredictable and yet incredibly beautiful. Every day brings new challenges but also new learnings and moments of pure joy. So while it‚Äôs true that life may become more difficult with children, it also becomes meaningful and fulfilling.

Children give us an opportunity to truly face life - with all its ups and downs. They remind us that while life is hard, it's also filled with moments worth living for. They help us shift our focus from our own selves to something bigger than us, teaching us selflessness and unconditional love in its truest form.

In conclusion, having children may throw you into the deep end of responsibilities and challenges but it also opens up a world of love, learning and personal growth that nothing else can offer. So embrace this journey of parenthood - for every hard day there will be countless moments of joy; for every challenge faced there will be immense growth. After all, through our children we get an opportunity to face life in its rawest form - beautiful yet challenging; exhausting yet fulfilling.
