# The Journey - Learning Event Eight WalkMyWorld 2015

Welcome all to Learning Event Eight¬†in the #WalkMyWorld Project. For the full write-up on this eighth¬†learning event, please [click here](https://sites.google.com/site/walkmyworldproject/2015-learning-events/the-journey). This blog post will share the information presented in the original post on the [#WalkMyWorld Project website](https://sites.google.com/site/walkmyworldproject/), but add a bit of extra information and guidance.

### Where does this journey take us?

In the last learning event we asked that you share a look in the mirrors that inhabit your world. We asked that you consider where these mirrors may take you. This learning event, we think about the journey along the way, and what we learn in the process.

Specifically, we're asking what journey (or journeys) have you taken to get this point? What trials and tribulations have you encountered along the path? What great deeds and stories will you return to to give the world to make it a better place?

### What do we learn about ourselves in the journey?

In many of our cultural narratives there is a pattern of events which [Joseph Campbell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Campbell) called the monomyth. The [monomyth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monomyth) is frequently referred to as the hero's journey. It should be noted that there is controversy about the hero's journey [rewriting privilege](http://goodmenproject.com/featured-content/heros-journey-vs-heroines-journey-rewriting-privilege/)¬†in narratives. For a good overview of the monomyth, the journey, and personal archetypes in the narrative, please review [this page](http://www.thewritersjourney.com/hero's_journey.htm#Hero).

In our own lives, we may engage on our own journey. Campbell [identified](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hero_with_a_Thousand_Faces) this as events in which you venture forth from the world of the common day into a region of supernatural wonder. You encountered fabulous forces and won decisive victories. You return from this mysterious adventure with new powers and knowledge to share with¬†friends, family, and students.

In considering your journey, you could think of your weeks in the #WalkMyWorld project as a kind of voyage¬†that you have taken with us. What wonders have you encountered along the way? What challenges and opportunities¬†have you overcome in this voyage? What knowledge, skills, and dispositions¬†will you bring back from this journey?

### How do I do this?

Watch the following video from Matthew Winkler discussing what makes a hero. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhk4N9A0oCA

Watch the following video by Tim Adams on what makes an anti-hero. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEjgDeSnBMs

Think about the journey that you are about to complete. You might think of this journey in the #WalkMyWorld project, or you might consider an alternate journey in your life. What journey speaks the most to you? What journey would you like to share with others? What challenges and opportunities have you experienced along the journey? What skills and expertise will you share with others after your journey?
