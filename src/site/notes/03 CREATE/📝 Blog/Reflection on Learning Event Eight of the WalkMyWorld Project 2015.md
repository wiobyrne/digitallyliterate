# Reflection on Learning Event Eight of the WalkMyWorld Project 2015

We‚Äôre nearing the end of Learning Event Eight¬†of the #WalkMyWorld Project 2015. You can learn more about Learning Event Eight¬†by [clicking here](https://sites.google.com/site/walkmyworldproject/2015-learning-events/the-journey).

This week we examined the voyages that we have each taken in the #WalkMyWorld project...and possibly in our own lives. We considered the role of heroes and anti-heroes in our cultures. Each of us developed a hero, or anti-hero based on what we have learned in the process of our journeys.

### Capturing the heroes in our lives

Throughout this learning event, there have been a ton of awesome pieces shared that are equal parts reflective and empowering. Usually in these reflective pieces in each learning event, I try to synthesize the major themes across the materials shared in the week.

This week I would rather embed the tweets below and let the work speak for itself. The tweets I'm sharing are by no means a representative sample of the work shared in the learning event. I grabbed and shared pieces that spoke to me.

Enjoy. https://twitter.com/SSWithMcGrath/status/576768679720972288 https://twitter.com/cpastor24/status/576554981358202880 https://twitter.com/annar2389/status/576563582147670016 https://twitter.com/BrandlMusic/status/576534634315542528 https://twitter.com/off\_beat\_music/status/576160807458889728 https://twitter.com/khourigan/status/576116006277550082

The last piece I'd like to share is an awesome lip sync video from Melvina Kurashige ([@mkurashige](https://twitter.com/mkurashige)). I'm hoping that she and her set of heroes put together a "behind the scenes" post showing the process used. https://twitter.com/mkurashige/status/576791704444899328

Thank you to everyone for connecting and reflecting this week, and throughout the project. It's been a lot of fun seeing how everyone responds to the prompts with their own content and work. The shared content is really moving, and it often sticks to me for a couple of days. Thanks again.
