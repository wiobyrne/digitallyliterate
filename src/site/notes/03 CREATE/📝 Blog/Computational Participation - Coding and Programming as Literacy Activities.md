# Computational Participation - Coding and Programming as Literacy Activities

Over the past two years I have served¬†as Multiliteracies Department Editor for the¬†[Journal and Adolescent and Adult Literacy](http://www.reading.org/general/publications/journals/jaal.aspx) (JAAL). You can review the work that we have produced and the accompanying video interviews through [this thread](http://wiobyrne.com/tag/jaal/).

### Computational Thinking and Computational Participation

For this column, I worked with [Quinn Burke](http://teachered.cofc.edu/faculty-staff-listing/burke-quinn.php) and [Yasmin Kafai](http://scholar.gse.upenn.edu/kafai) to discuss opportunities for coding and programming in a literacy-based classroom. We make the case for coding as a new literacy and the potential of teaching code to middle school and high school novices through a series of workshops. ¬†Through the workshop process, we argue that children not only develop the logic and problem-solving to think computationally, but also to socialize with each other through their coded stories, developing a wider appreciation of what it means to participate computationally.

In this post, we‚Äôre sharing the manuscript that was submitted for publication. You can [access the published version here](https://www.academia.edu/20080137/Computational_Participation_Understanding_Coding_as_an_Extension_of_Literacy_Instruction).
