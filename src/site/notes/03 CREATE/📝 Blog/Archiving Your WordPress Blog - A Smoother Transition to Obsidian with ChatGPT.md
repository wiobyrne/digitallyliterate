Archiving Your WordPress Blog: A Smoother Transition to Obsidian with ChatGPT
<p>As a content creator, I know the importance of preserving and making my Newsletter accessible and integrated into my broader knowledge management workflow.

<p>The process started easily enough as I downloaded an archive (in XML format) of my Newsletter. After that, the prospect of automating this conversion process to markdown proved to be a challenge. Despite my best efforts, I grappled with technical hurdles and uncertainties, unable to seamlessly bridge the gap between WordPress and Obsidian.</p>
