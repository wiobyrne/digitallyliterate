# Week Ten - Online Content Construction

Welcome to week ten of the Online Research and Media Skills (ORMS) Mentored Open Online Community (MOOC).¬†The [ORMS MOOC](http://wiobyrne.com/join-the-orms-mooc/)¬†has existed in different iterations over the last two years. This current version is developed as an open learning experience for students in ED 6671¬†([syllabus here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18rvWMAKhnbKiSgOalGLXsE1TrBpO62mhvQXV1OeU9SY/edit?usp=sharing)). ED 6671 examines opportunities for the use of instructional technologies in an educational context.

In week ten of the ORMS MOOC we‚Äôre completing our work in Module 4 of the ORMS Model. Once again, you can learn more about the [MOOC here](http://wiobyrne.com/join-the-orms-mooc/)‚Ä¶and access [the actual MOOC here](https://sites.google.com/site/ormsmodel/).

### Online Content Construction

As detailed in [the post last week](http://wiobyrne.com/week-nine-students-writing-creating-and-composing-digital-content/), in this module we‚Äôll be looking at [Online Content Construction](https://sites.google.com/site/ormsmodel/modules/module-4-online-content-construction). Online content construction has a special place in my heart. I view it as the composing, creating, making, or writing side of digital content. You can read much more about my thinking on this in [the post about creation as opposed to the construction of digital content](http://wiobyrne.com/construction-andor-creation-of-online-content/).

At this point in the module, you should have already read/viewed all (and then some) of the materials I shared. You should have shared your reflection out on a blog post and reviewed the work of others.

To obtain the badge and complete this module, you‚Äôll need to think about possible ways to integrate online content construction into your classroom. You‚Äôre the expert of your content area‚Ä¶your grade level‚Ä¶your students. If you want your students to engage in this activity‚Ä¶how would you do it?

### Make this happen in your classroom

For the Online Content Construction badge, develop a lesson plan, supplemental materials, handouts, videos, etc. Develop any & all materials that you would use with your students that teach this in your classroom. Embed all of this content on your blog or website. Build and share everything in a manner or format that would make sense to use as a teaching material. This means that you‚Äôre writing it for your students. Build this as if you would actually use it in your lessons.

After you have built it up, please share it out online. Share it out on your various social networks and in our [Google+ Community](https://plus.google.com/communities/109374663190019101967?utm_source=chrome_ntp_icon&utm_medium=chrome_app&utm_campaign=chrome). After you‚Äôve completed up to this step‚Ä¶go ahead and submit it in our [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ormsclass) to earn [the badge for this module](https://badges.mozilla.org/en-US/badges/badge/Online-Content-Construction-Exemplar-Badge).
