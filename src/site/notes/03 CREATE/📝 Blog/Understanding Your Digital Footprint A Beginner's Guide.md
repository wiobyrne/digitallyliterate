# Understanding Your Digital Footprint A Beginner's Guide

*Part 5 of the Digital Resilience Series*

Whenever you search for something, click a link, or post online, you leave behind a little trail. Your digital footprint is a kind of online breadcrumb trail that can tell others a lot about you.

But here's the thing: much of this happens without you even realizing it.

In today's connected world, understanding and managing your digital footprint is one of the best ways to protect your privacy and feel more in control of your online life. Don't worry—you don't need to be a tech expert to get started.

## What Is a Digital Footprint?

Your digital footprint is everything you leave behind when you go online. It includes things you choose to share, and things collected about you without you knowing. This data trail can be categorized into two main types:

### Active Digital Footprint

This includes things you do on purpose—stuff you know you're sharing:

✍️ Posts, comments, and likes on social media  
📸 Uploading photos or videos  
📝 Filling out online forms or signing up for accounts  
🛒 Shopping online or writing reviews  
💳 Using banking apps or doing online finance tasks  

These are intentional actions that create a data trail.

### Passive Digital Footprint

This is the stuff that's collected behind the scenes, often without you realizing it:

🍪 Cookies that track your visits  
🌐 IP address logging (your device's unique identifier)  
📍 Location tracking from your phone  
🧠 "Browser fingerprinting" (your device settings and habits)  
📑 Your browsing history and search habits  

Even just visiting a website can leave a trail others can see or use.

## How to Find Out What's Online About You

Want to see what your digital footprint looks like? Here's a simple way to start:

### 1. Google Yourself (The Right Way)

Use a private browsing window so the results aren't personalized to you.

**Steps:**
- Open an Incognito or Private browser tab
- Search for your full name in quotes (e.g., "Jane Smith")
- Try other searches like:
  - "Jane Smith Chicago"
  - Your email address, usernames, or phone number
- Don't stop at the first page—check 3–5 pages of results
- Look at both web and image results

### 2. Check Your Social Media from a Stranger's View

- Log out of your accounts and look at your profile from the outside
- On Facebook, use the "View As" feature to see what others see
- Review privacy settings and limit what's public
- See which apps are connected to your social accounts
- Download your data archive to see what each platform stores about you

### 3. See What Data Brokers Know About You

A data broker is a company that collects, analyzes, and sells personal information about consumers. You may not know the names of these data brokers, but they likely know about you. They aggregate information from public records, purchase histories, online activities, and other sources to create detailed profiles.

Here's a list of some prominent data brokers that may have information about you:

- Acxiom
- Epsilon
- Experian
- Equifax
- Radaris
- BeenVerified

**Pro Tip**: Visit the IntelTechniques Workbook for an updated list of these companies and step-by-step instructions for removing your info.

## Tools That Help You Understand and Manage Your Digital Footprint

You don't need to be tech-savvy to take control. Here are a few easy-to-use tools:

### See Who's Tracking You

- **Ghostery or Privacy Badger** (browser add-ons): Show who's collecting your data as you browse
- **Google Alerts**: Set one up with your name to get emails when new info about you appears online
- **"View As" Tools** on Facebook and other networks let you preview your public profile

### Beginner-Friendly Privacy Tools

- **Mine (saymine.com)**: Scans your inbox to show which companies have your data and lets you request deletion
- **Spokeo**: A people-search tool that shows what others can find about you
- **Have I Been Pwned (haveibeenpwned.com)**: See if your email was part of a data breach

## Quick Clean-Up Routine (Every 3 Months)

🔎 Google yourself and review the results  
🔐 Update social media privacy settings  
🧽 Delete old accounts you no longer use  
📱 Remove apps you don't use from your phone  

## Easy Privacy Upgrades

🌐 Use Firefox or Brave instead of Chrome  
🍪 Decline optional cookies on websites  
📧 Use a different email for online shopping than for personal use  
📡 Use a simple VPN when using public Wi-Fi (like at cafes or airports)  

## What's Next: How Technology Keeps Expanding Your Footprint

Even if you're careful, newer tech keeps adding more layers to your digital identity.

### 📱 Smart Devices (IoT)

Smart speakers, thermostats, and fitness trackers collect data about your routines and preferences.

### 👁️ Biometric Data

Face recognition, voice ID, even how you walk—these are biometric identifiers that are harder to change than a password if leaked.

### 🤖 AI & Predictions

Today's tech can analyze your behavior to predict your interests, habits, even health conditions—often without telling you.

## Final Thoughts

Your digital footprint is bigger than you might think, but you have the power to shape it. With a few small steps, you can protect your privacy, clean up your online presence, and feel more confident using the web.
