# IT&DML Syllabus for Critical Issues & Research in New Literacies

This post is part of a series of 11 posts in which we‚Äôre sharing the syllabi for all 11 courses in the¬†[Instructional Technology and Digital Media Literacy](http://www.newhaven.edu/4486/academic-programs/graduate-programs/instructional-technologies/)¬†(IT&DML) program. Please keep in mind the materials we‚Äôre sharing here are the documents and specifics as approved when we initially launched the program. The ‚Äúreal‚Äù implementation of these courses is a bit different as we embrace new digital texts and tools.

### Critical Issues & Research in New Literacies

This course is the fifth¬†in a series of 11 courses in the¬†in the¬†[sequence of courses](http://wiobyrne.com/course-sequence-for-the-instructional-technology-digital-media-literacy-program/). This course focuses on the theory and practice involved in new literacies and New Literacies...as well as the [ORMS model](http://wiobyrne.com/tag/orms/). This class is a modified version of the class that I taught and developed over the past couple of years.

### Course Description

This course is designed to provide a context in which pre-service and in-service teachers can explore the research and practice in the rapidly emerging area of the New Literacies of the Internet and other communication technologies (ICTs). This course comprises a theoretical dimension that focuses on literacy as a social practice and a practical dimension that includes hands-on use of a range of new digital technologies and new literacy practices. Attention will be paid to developing effective ways of taking up new literacies in classroom contexts.

### Core Objectives

1. Students will explain in depth, central principles that define the new literacies, broadly conceived, as well as the more specifically focused new literacies of online reading comprehension.
2. Students will integrate the new literacies of the Internet and other communication technologies into classroom reading, writing, and content area instruction in effective ways.
3. Students will design and develop an exemplary classroom webpage that includes effective integration of the new literacies of online reading comprehension.
4. Students will evaluate the online reading comprehension skills of K-12 students.
5. Students will explore, in depth, one aspect of either new literacies or Internet integration into the classroom.

### Essential Questions

- What are the knowledge, skills, and dispositions students need while successfully reading and constructing online content?
- What pedagogy and instructional strategies are needed to scaffold all students to be able to successfully read and write using online texts?
- What assessment tools can be used or developed to measure these new literacies?
