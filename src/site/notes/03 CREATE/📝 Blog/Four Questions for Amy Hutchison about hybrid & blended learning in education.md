# Four Questions for Amy Hutchison about hybrid & blended learning in education

Our column on [Hybrid & Blended Learning: Modifying pedagogy across time, place, path, & pace](http://wiobyrne.com/hybrid-blended-learning-modifying-pedagogy-across-time-place-path-and-pace/) was just published in [JAAL](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jaal.463/abstract). I co-wrote the column with¬†[Kristy Pytash](https://twitter.com/kpytash).

As a supplement to the column, we invited a series of experts to spend some time discussing the broader impact of the details presented. The end result is a series of¬†_short_¬†video segments of the experts responding to a set of four questions about the column. You can review the video interview and four questions used at the bottom of this post.

1. What is hybrid/blended learning?
2. What effect does this have on pedagogy, and interactions in the classroom?
3. What do teachers need to know to make this happen?
4. Things are always changing in the classroom (shift happens, etc.), what might the future look like in terms of place, space, and technology...how do teachers and students prepare for this eventuality?
