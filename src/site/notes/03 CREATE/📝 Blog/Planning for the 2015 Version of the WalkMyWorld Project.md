# Planning for the 2015 Version of the WalkMyWorld Project

We had a great meeting today to discuss upcoming plans and goals for the #WalkMyWorld project. I've documented much of our previous work with the project on this [website](http://wiobyrne.com/tag/walkmyworld/). You can also review materials from the previous year, and research that we've conducted as a result of the project on the [project website](https://sites.google.com/site/walkmyworldproject/).

This project, and the research has been conducted in the open, and this year we wanted to begin planning for the project out in the open as well. Would you like to join us and help develop and facilitate this "accidental MOOC"? Please join us...we'd love to have you.

You can review the video from our Hangout below. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k74\_kXppI-Q The Google Doc that we'll use to plan and script out the learning events for the 2015 version of the #WalkMyWorld project is also available below. Please feel to jump in and leave a comment or question. Please also join us in January as we start allowing others to take a walk in our own world.
