# AI Coders

Imagine if your computer could write its own programs and fix any problems with them by itself. That's what some new AI tools are starting to do! Some people think this is awesome and will help us do even bigger things in the future. But others aren't so sure because they don't think computers can really understand how programming works deep down. Either way, it looks like how we make software might change a lot soon!

Questions:

1) How does training an AI model on underlying logic differ from training it on examples?
2) How will this shift change the job market for software engineers?
3) How close are we to achieving artificial general intelligence?
4) What challenges might arise in managing AI-generated code?
5) What are the implications of AI writing more and more of our software?
