## Draft

The year was 2023. The world had changed dramatically in just a few short years. The education system had been completely overhauled, and not in the way many would have liked. Schools were empty, playgrounds silent, and the streets devoid of laughter or chatter of young children. Kids no longer went to school, they didn't socialize - they just sat at home.

It all started with a technological innovation that promised to revolutionize education, a virtual reality system known as "EduSphere". It was touted as the ultimate learning tool that allowed kids to learn at their own pace from home. However, it ended up replacing traditional schools entirely.

Every child on their eighth birthday received an EduSphere unit from the State. From then on, they were plunged into a world of virtual lessons and exams, without any human interaction or physical activity. Their days consisted of academics, virtual meals and sleep - an endless cycle without any room for friendships or fun.

In this new world order, children became more like machines than human beings‚Äîhighly efficient at absorbing information but devoid of emotions or social skills. They lived in silos with their families but never interacted with other kids their age.

The government saw this as an achievement - literacy rates were at an all-time high; crime rates among youngsters had plummeted; obesity was no longer an issue since meals were regulated by the EduSphere. But what they overlooked was the emotional and psychological cost it had on the children.

Parents watched helplessly as their children grew distant and detached. Attempts to connect with them outside of the EduSphere were met with disinterest or confusion by kids who knew nothing beyond their virtual classrooms.

In this dystopian society lived 10-year-old Adam. He often found himself staring longingly out his window watching birds fly freely in the sky while he felt trapped within his own home. His parents tried their best to engage him in games or conversations, but Adam felt out of place.

Adam craved for something more. He missed the sound of laughter, the joy of playing with friends, the thrill of exploring the world beyond screens. He yearned for a time he had never known - a time where children ran freely under the open sky, where learning was fun and not an isolating task.

One day, while scrolling through an old digital archive in his EduSphere, Adam stumbled upon a concept foreign to him - friendship. Intrigued, he dug deeper and discovered stories about real schools, playgrounds, and kids socializing.

The realization hit him hard. He understood what he had been missing all these years - human connection.

Adam decided to rebel against the system. He began by disconnecting from his EduSphere lessons an hour early each day to interact with his parents. They taught him games that they used to play as kids and told him stories about their school days.

Word quickly spread among other children about Adam's rebellion. They were fascinated by this new concept of 'play' and 'socializing'. One by one they began disconnecting from their EduSphere units for a part of their day to experience this newfound joy.

As more children joined the rebellion, they grew bolder and started venturing out of their homes to meet each other ‚Äì something that hadn't happened in years. The empty parks echoed with laughter again; vacant streets buzzed with chatter and games; children experienced true childhood again.

The government wasn't pleased at first but couldn't ignore the positive effect it had on the young generation's mental health. The resilience shown by these young rebels led to a reconsideration of their education policies.

The Isolation Generation refused to be isolated any longer; they tore down walls built around them and reclaimed their right to be just kids again.
