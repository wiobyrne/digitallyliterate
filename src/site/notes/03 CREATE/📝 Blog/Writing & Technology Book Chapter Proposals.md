# Writing & Technology Book Chapter Proposals

An announcement went out about the same time I was starting up the semester looking for chapter proposals for a new book on writing and technology coming out soon. I've never written a chapter by myself, but was very much intrigued as it would provide me with an opportunity to further expand my thinking on online content construction as I see it playing out in my dissertation.

At the same time, I was contacted by my colleagues Greg McVerry and Sue Ringler-Pet. The three of us have spent the last couple of years presenting at NCTE on the use of multimodal content construction as a means to help students and teachers discuss and experience poetry. We decided the chapter would be a good place for us to¬†compile¬†these resources into one chapter that teachers could use as they consider our work and ideas.

I have embedded the two chapter proposals which were submitted...and accepted for the upcoming book. Now...we just need to write them...
