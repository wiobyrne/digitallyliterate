# Video Overview of the Online Research & Media Skills MOOC

I put together a video overview in which I talk through some of the elements of the Online Research and Media Skills (ORMS) Mentored Open, Online Community (MOOC).

The [ORMS MOOC](http://wiobyrne.com/join-the-orms-mooc/)¬†examines opportunities for the use of instructional technologies in an educational context. We‚Äôll not only discuss _what_ to use in your classroom‚Ä¶but also _how_ to use it. My thinking is that if you can say that you've embedded all three cornerstones of the ORMS model (online collaborative inquiry, online reading comprehension, online content construction) in your classroom...I think you've authentically, effectively embedded instructional technologies.

The video below shares all of the information I have been sharing over [these threads](http://wiobyrne.com/tag/ormsmooc/). This video is meant to act as a supplement for participants that don't learn simply by reading my long, boring Newsletter. :)

You can learn more about the [MOOC here](http://wiobyrne.com/join-the-orms-mooc/)...and access [the actual MOOC here](https://sites.google.com/site/ormsmodel/).
