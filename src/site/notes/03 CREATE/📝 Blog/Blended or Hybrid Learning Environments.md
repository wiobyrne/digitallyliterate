# Blended or Hybrid Learning Environments

I'll be speaking today the the Literacy Institute II for the CT Department of Education today. In today's session we'll be examining exactly what is a hybrid, or blended learning environment. The group of high school educators is beginning to examine the skills and structure that are necessary to create a mix between and online and offline learning environment for students.

Part of this is a challenge because we're talking about a number of factors that will influence the overall design of your blended or hybrid learning environment. School access, home access, student ability, and administration support all play a role in determining your environment. The biggest factor may ultimately be time. Time that the educator invests in building, testing, and revising this environment. In many ways we need to move to an "engineering" model of education. This calls for teachers to design, build, test, and revise the learning environment...and then build, test, and revise again...and again...

I'll leave participants today with three steps to get started as they plan, build, and test their blended or hybrid learning environments:

1\. Start a [Digital Learning Hub](http://wiobyrne.com/use-google-sites-for-educators-to-build-your-own-digital-learning-hub/)

2\. Create digital copies of learning materials

3\. Build hybrid classroom online and iterate

The PPT for today's session is available below.
