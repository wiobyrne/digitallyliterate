# When the AI Forgets

[[03 CREATE/🎯 Projects/🟢 Active/Homelab Bloging/Homelab Journey Overview\|Homelab Journey Overview]]

Exploring the moments where AI models lost context — and how that mirrors the fragility of human attention, memory, and project continuity.

## 🧠 Themes
- Context drift and continuity loss  
- Human-AI co-memory in long-term projects  
- What forgetting reveals about learning  

## 🧩 Possible Angle
Compare “AI forgetting” to reconfiguring a server — data loss, sync issues, and rebuilding trust in the system.
