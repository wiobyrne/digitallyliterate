## Core Claim

Digital literacies research has evolved from technical competencies to encompass complex sociocultural practices, critical engagements, and material-technological entanglements. **Ontological and epistemological assumptions underpin methodological choices**—understanding these assumptions is essential for designing research and evaluating claims.

## Historical Evolution

### Phase 1: Functional Literacy (1980s–2000s)

**Focus**: "Digital literacy" as extension of computer/information literacy

**Key characteristics**:
- Emphasis on technical skills and cognitive processing
- Measurable competencies
- Individual acquisition model
- Gilster (1997) as foundational text

**Underlying assumptions**:
- Literacy as neutral skill
- Technology as tool to be mastered
- Context-independent competencies

### Phase 2: Sociocultural Turn (2000s–2010s)

**Focus**: Shift toward New Literacy Studies frameworks

**Key characteristics**:
- Situated practices over decontextualized skills
- Identity construction
- Multimodal meaning-making
- Street (1995), Gee (1999) as foundations

**Underlying assumptions**:
- Literacy as social practice
- Context shapes meaning
- Multiple literacies for multiple contexts

### Phase 3: Critical/Transformative Wave (2010s–Present)

**Focus**: Integration of equity theories and critical pedagogy

**Key characteristics**:
- Power imbalances in digital spaces
- Design justice principles
- Freire (1970) influence
- Attention to marginalization

**Underlying assumptions**:
- Literacy is political
- Research should serve transformation
- Justice as methodological concern

### Phase 4: Post-Digital/Emergent (Emerging)

**Focus**: Material-technological entanglements, post-qualitative inquiry

**Key characteristics**:
- Human-nonhuman assemblages
- Algorithmic agency
- Speculative methods
- New materialism influences

**Underlying assumptions**:
- Agency distributed across human and nonhuman actors
- Categories like "digital" and "literacy" are unstable
- Research methods must evolve with phenomena

## Research Paradigms

### Positivist-Experimental Designs

**Ontology**: Single, objective reality exists and can be measured

**Epistemology**: Knowledge through observation, measurement, hypothesis testing

**Methods**:
- Randomized controlled trials
- Quasi-experimental designs
- Standardized assessments
- Large-scale surveys

**Strengths**:
- Generalizable findings
- Policy-relevant at scale
- Clear causal claims (when well-designed)

**Limitations**:
- May miss contextual nuance
- Privilege measurable over meaningful
- Risk of reductionism

**Questions it answers well**:
- Does intervention X improve outcome Y?
- What is the prevalence of skill Z?
- Are there significant differences between groups?

### Interpretive Designs

**Ontology**: Multiple, constructed realities exist

**Epistemology**: Knowledge through understanding meaning-making

**Methods**:
- Ethnography
- Case study
- Narrative inquiry
- Phenomenology

**Strengths**:
- Rich contextual understanding
- Participant perspectives centered
- Captures complexity

**Limitations**:
- Limited generalizability
- Time-intensive
- Researcher positionality challenges

**Questions it answers well**:
- How do participants experience X?
- What meanings do people make of Y?
- What are the situated practices of Z?

### Critical Designs

**Ontology**: Reality shaped by power structures that can be transformed

**Epistemology**: Knowledge is political; research should serve emancipation

**Methods**:
- Critical discourse analysis
- Participatory action research
- Critical ethnography
- Design-based research with equity focus

**Strengths**:
- Addresses power and inequality
- Connects to social change
- Centers marginalized perspectives

**Limitations**:
- May be dismissed as "advocacy"
- Tension between research and activism
- Complexity of power analysis

**Questions it answers well**:
- How do power structures shape X?
- Whose interests are served by Y?
- How can Z be transformed for justice?

### Post-Qualitative Designs

**Ontology**: Reality as processual, relational, emergent

**Epistemology**: Knowledge as entangled, partial, always becoming

**Methods**:
- Diffractive analysis
- Speculative inquiry
- Assemblage mapping
- Artistic/creative methods

**Strengths**:
- Captures emergence and complexity
- Attends to nonhuman actors
- Methodological innovation

**Limitations**:
- Difficult to communicate to policy audiences
- Newer, less established
- Can seem abstract

**Questions it answers well**:
- What is emerging in this assemblage?
- How do human and nonhuman actors co-constitute X?
- What might become possible?

## Choosing a Paradigm

### Alignment Questions

1. **What is the nature of the phenomenon?**
   - Stable and measurable → positivist
   - Meaning-laden and contextual → interpretive
   - Power-structured and changeable → critical
   - Emergent and entangled → post-qualitative

2. **What kind of claims do you want to make?**
   - Causal, generalizable → positivist
   - Descriptive, contextual → interpretive
   - Transformative → critical
   - Speculative, generative → post-qualitative

3. **Who is the audience?**
   - Policymakers → often positivist
   - Practitioners → often interpretive
   - Advocates/activists → often critical
   - Scholars → any, depends on field

4. **What are your commitments?**
   - Objectivity/neutrality → positivist
   - Understanding → interpretive
   - Justice → critical
   - Experimentation → post-qualitative

### Mixed and Integrated Approaches

Many digital literacies researchers combine paradigms:
- Sequential designs (qualitative exploration → quantitative testing)
- Concurrent designs (multiple methods simultaneously)
- Critical quantitative approaches
- Participatory mixed methods

The key is **coherence**—ontological and epistemological assumptions should align across the design.

## Tensions in the Field

### Functional vs. Critical

- Skills acquisition vs. power analysis
- Individual competence vs. systemic change
- Measurable outcomes vs. transformation

### Local vs. Generalizable

- Rich case studies vs. scalable findings
- Context-sensitivity vs. transferability
- Depth vs. breadth

### Present vs. Emerging

- Studying current practices vs. anticipating futures
- Established methods vs. methodological innovation
- Known phenomena vs. emergent possibilities

---

## Open Questions

- How do we study phenomena (AI, algorithms) that are opaque and rapidly changing?
- What methods are appropriate for researching human-AI entanglements?
- How do we maintain critical edge while producing policy-relevant findings?
- What does "rigor" mean across different paradigms?
