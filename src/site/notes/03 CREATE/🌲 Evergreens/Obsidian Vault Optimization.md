# Obsidian Vault Optimization

*Strategic recommendations for navigation, scalability, and workflow efficiency*

---

## Executive Summary

A well-optimized vault follows the **CONSUME → DEVELOP → CREATE → META** flow with clear developmental stages (🌱🌿🌲), consistent naming conventions, and streamlined processing workflows.

---

## Recommended Folder Structure

```
01 CONSUME/
├── 📥 Inbox/           # Quick capture only
├── 📚 Books/
├── 📰 Articles/
├── 🎙️ Podcasts/
├── 👥 People/
└── 🔄 Processing/      # Items being actively processed

02 DEVELOP/
├── 🌱 Seeds/          # Early-stage ideas
├── 🌿 Plants/         # Active development
├── 🗂️ MOCs/           # Maps of Content
└── 📋 Indexes/

03 CREATE/
├── 🌲 Evergreen/      # Mature, reusable notes
├── 📝 Blog/
├── 📧 Newsletter/
├── 🎯 Projects/
└── 📊 Presentations/

04 META/
├── 🛠️ System/         # Templates, guides, settings
├── 📈 Tracking/       # Changelogs, reviews
└── 🔗 Assets/
```

## Processing Pipeline

```
📥 Inbox → 🔄 Processing → 🌱 Seeds → 🌿 Plants → 🌲 Evergreen
```

### Inbox Discipline
- Inbox = temporary holding only (24-48 hours max)
- Add `Processing` folder for items being actively worked on
- Weekly inbox should be empty

---

## Naming Conventions

### File Naming Standards

| Content Type | Format | Example |
|--------------|--------|---------|
| Concepts | Title Case with Spaces | "Digital Literacy Framework" |
| Projects | YYYY-MM Project Name | "2024-12 Digital Garden Setup" |
| People | First Last | "Derek Sivers" |
| Templates | Template - Type | "Template - Book Note" |
| MOCs | MOC - Topic | "MOC - AI Research" |

### Folder Naming
- Use emojis sparingly but consistently for visual navigation
- Keep folder names short (under 15 characters when possible)
- Use descriptive names over abbreviations

---

## Tag System

### Tag Hierarchy

```yaml
# Content Type
tags: [fleeting-note, permanent-note, index-note]

# Domain/Topic (max 3 per note)
tags: [digital-literacy, ai-research, education-policy]

# Status (exactly one)
status: [🌱_seed, 🌿_plant, 🌲_evergreen]

# Action Required (optional)
action: [needs-review, needs-expansion, ready-to-publish]
```

### Tag Best Practices
- Lowercase, dash-separated format
- Maximum 3 domain tags per note
- One status indicator
- Consistent across vault

---

## Note Development Stages

### Stage 1: Capture (📥 Inbox)
- Raw thoughts, highlights, quick captures
- No formatting requirements
- Maximum 48-hour residence time

### Stage 2: Processing (🔄 Processing)
- Add proper YAML frontmatter
- Link to existing notes
- Identify development path
- Move to appropriate development stage

### Stage 3: Development Stages

| Stage | Characteristics | Word Count |
|-------|----------------|------------|
| 🌱 Seeds | Single insight, question, or observation | 500-3,000 |
| 🌿 Plants | Multiple connected ideas, partial development | 5,000+ |
| 🌲 Evergreen | Complete thoughts, ready for publishing | 10,000+ |

---

## Review Systems

### Weekly Reviews
- Inbox processing (should be empty)
- Seeds ready for development
- Plants ready for evergreen status
- Evergreen notes needing updates

### Monthly System Reviews
- Tag cleanup and standardization
- Folder organization assessment
- Template updates
- Archive old projects

---

## Digital Garden Integration

### Publishing Workflow
```
🌲 Evergreen → Review for Publishing → Add dg-publish: true → Auto-sync to Garden
```

### Quality Gates Before Publishing
- [ ] Proper YAML frontmatter
- [ ] Internal links resolved
- [ ] Grammar/style check
- [ ] Audience-appropriate content

---

## Project Management

### Recommended Project Structure
```
03 CREATE/🎯 Projects/
├── 🟢 Active/
│   ├── 2024-12 Digital Garden/
│   └── 2025-01 Course Development/
├── 🟡 On-Hold/
├── 🔴 Archived/
└── 📋 Project Registry.md    # Master project list with status
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)
1. Create new folder structure
2. Implement inbox discipline
3. Standardize file naming for new notes

### Phase 2: Migration (Week 3-4)
1. Gradually move notes to new structure
2. Update tags to new system
3. Create review workflows

### Phase 3: Optimization (Week 5-6)
1. Fine-tune workflows based on usage
2. Create automation where possible
3. Document final system in Guide.md

---

## Expected Outcomes

After implementation:

1. **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Clear categories reduce decision fatigue
2. **Improved Discoverability**: Better organization makes finding notes easier
3. **Faster Processing**: Streamlined workflows reduce friction
4. **Scalable Growth**: System handles increased volume without breaking down
5. **Better Publishing Pipeline**: Clear path from idea to published content

---

## Key Principle

> The goal is creating a system that works *with* your natural workflows rather than against them, while providing the structure needed for long-term scalability and effectiveness.
