## Core Claim

Wicked problems—complex, interconnected societal issues with no clear solution—provide the ideal pedagogical scaffold for authentic learning. When students work on problems that are **real, local, and resistant to easy answers**, shortcuts become harder and less valued. The learning itself becomes the point.

## What Makes a Problem "Wicked"

Wicked problems (Rittel & Webber, 1973) are characterized by:

- **No definitive formulation**: The problem can be framed multiple ways
- **No stopping rule**: You never "solve" it completely
- **No true/false solutions**: Only better or worse responses
- **Unique instances**: Every wicked problem is essentially unique
- **Interconnected causes**: Pull one thread and others move
- **Multiple stakeholders**: Different groups have different interests
- **Consequences are irreversible**: Stakes are real

**Examples**: Climate change, educational equity, cultural preservation, health disparities, digital divides

## The Pedagogical Power

### Why Wicked Problems Work

| Traditional Assignment | Wicked Problem Assignment |
|------------------------|---------------------------|
| Single correct answer | Multiple valid approaches |
| Decontextualized | Embedded in real community |
| Individual work | Requires collaboration |
| Teacher as authority | Teacher as co-inquirer |
| Easy to shortcut | Shortcuts don't help |
| Content coverage | Capacity building |

### What Students Learn

Through wicked problems, students develop:

- **Ethical reasoning**: No answer is value-free
- **Systems thinking**: Everything connects
- **Tolerance for ambiguity**: Comfort with uncertainty
- **Stakeholder analysis**: Whose interests matter?
- **Interdisciplinary fluency**: No single discipline suffices
- **Action orientation**: Analysis without action is incomplete

## The STEAM Ethics Toolkit Framework

A four-component structure for engaging wicked problems through STEAM:

### 1. Ethical Awareness
*Identifying ethical issues in STEAM disciplines*

- What makes this a problem?
- Who is affected?
- Who benefits from the status quo?
- What values are at stake?

### 2. Ethical Analysis
*Applying frameworks to examine issues*

- What do different ethical lenses reveal? (justice, care, consequences, rights)
- What trade-offs exist between values?
- What would each STEAM discipline notice?

### 3. Ethical Argumentation
*Developing and defending positions*

- What stance am I taking, and why?
- What evidence supports this position?
- What are the strongest counterarguments?
- How do I respond to them?

### 4. Ethical Action
*Proposing solutions and responses*

- What can actually be done?
- Who needs to be involved?
- What are unintended consequences?
- How do we balance innovation with responsibility?

## STEAM as Ethical Lens

Each discipline contributes a distinct perspective:

| Discipline | Contribution to Wicked Problems |
|------------|--------------------------------|
| **Science** | Data, systems, environmental factors, evidence |
| **Technology** | Tools, innovation, access, digital dimensions |
| **Engineering** | Design, infrastructure, scalability, constraints |
| **Arts** | Storytelling, awareness, cultural expression, voice |
| **Mathematics** | Patterns, models, quantification, prediction |

**The insight**: No single discipline is sufficient. Wicked problems require **interdisciplinary integration**—and attending to tensions between disciplinary perspectives.

## Case Study: Gullah Geechee Culture

A model wicked problem for STEAM ethics:

### The Context
Gullah Geechee communities in the Lowcountry face:
- Land displacement and development pressure
- Cultural preservation challenges
- Environmental justice issues
- Systemic inequities in resources and recognition

### Why It Works Pedagogically

- **Local and real**: Students can visit, engage, learn from community members
- **Complex causation**: Historical, economic, environmental, cultural threads
- **Multiple stakeholders**: Descendants, developers, preservationists, government
- **No easy answer**: Preservation vs. development, tradition vs. adaptation
- **STEAM-rich**: Environmental science, cultural technology, design, storytelling, data

### Ethical Questions It Raises

- Who gets to decide what happens to land and culture?
- What does "preservation" mean, and who defines it?
- How do outsiders engage respectfully without extracting?
- What responsibilities do STEAM professionals have?

## AI as Inquiry Partner

Generative AI can support wicked problem inquiry:

**Useful prompts**:
> "What are the ethical challenges involved in [wicked problem]? Consider multiple stakeholder perspectives."

> "What might be unintended consequences of [proposed solution]?"

> "What would a [justice / care / utilitarian] ethical framework say about this situation?"

**Critical reflection questions**:
- What insights did AI provide that I hadn't considered?
- What did AI miss or oversimplify?
- Did I agree or disagree with AI's suggestions? Why?
- How did my thinking change through this process?

The goal: **AI as thought partner, not answer machine**. Students should interrogate AI outputs, not accept them uncritically.

---

## Connection to Authentic Assessment

Wicked problems address the "cheating problem" differently than detection tools:

- When the problem is genuinely complex, there's nothing to copy
- When the problem is local, generic AI answers don't fit
- When reflection is required, process matters as much as product
- When stakes feel real, shortcuts feel unsatisfying

This is what the note on [[03 CREATE/🌲 Evergreens/AI Detection and Authentic Assessment\|AI Detection and Authentic Assessment]] argues: **With systems focused on authentic assessment on real-world wicked problems, cheating is harder and not valued by students.**

## Open Questions

- How do we select wicked problems that are appropriately scoped for a course?
- How do we ensure engagement doesn't become extractive (studying communities without benefiting them)?
- What's the balance between student choice and instructor scaffolding?
- How do we assess work on problems with no right answer?
