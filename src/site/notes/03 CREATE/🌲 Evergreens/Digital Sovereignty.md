## Core Claim

Digital sovereignty means having control over your own digital destiny—your data, devices, and online tools. It's the principle that **you, not a corporation**, decide what happens with your information.

If you're not paying for a service, you are often the product. Every click and upload can be recorded. The question isn't whether to accept this tradeoff—it's whether you realize you're making it.

## The Problem: The Big Tech Data Grab

Large tech companies offer free services, but their business model is collecting and monetizing your data:

### How It Works

- **Email and Messages**: Gmail stores emails on Google's servers. Until 2017, Google scanned email contents to serve ads. Even now, they analyze data for features and spam filtering—and have been caught tracking searches and locations even in "incognito" mode.

- **Advertising Profiles**: Everything you do builds a profile: web searches, videos watched, what you "like," where you go. Companies use this to target ads or train AI. Google's AI assistant can read your emails and docs to answer questions.

- **Political and AI Manipulation**: Your data isn't only used for ads. Cambridge Analytica showed how social data can influence elections by creating psychological profiles from Facebook friends. AI companies train on millions of books without permission.

### The Evidence

- Texas won a $1.375 billion settlement against Google in 2025 for secretly logging locations, incognito searches, voiceprints, and facial geometry
- Cambridge Analytica harvested data from up to 87 million Facebook profiles without consent
- An AI chatbot maker paid $1.5 billion after using pirated books for training

These cases show that personal data—communications and creations—can easily be taken and used if we're not careful.

## What Digital Sovereignty Looks Like

For an individual, digital sovereignty means:

1. **Encrypted communications** so only you and the recipient can read them
2. **Services that don't log or sell personal info**
3. **Data stored under favorable laws** (e.g., Switzerland's constitutional privacy protections rather than US Patriot Act)
4. **Consent-based data collection** (opting in rather than being tracked by default)

In practice, it's independence from Big Tech. Instead of relying on one company's walled garden, you build a digital life where **you make the rules**.

## The Tools

### Proton Mail

- **End-to-end encryption**: Only you and your recipient can read messages
- **Zero-access encryption**: Proton cannot decrypt your inbox
- **Swiss jurisdiction**: Constitutional privacy protections, forbidden from mass surveillance
- **No ads or tracking**: Funded by subscriptions, not data harvesting

When a Proton user emails another Proton user, encryption happens automatically. For non-Proton addresses, password-protected emails secure the message.

### Signal

- **End-to-end encrypts everything**: texts, voice calls, video calls, attachments, group chats
- **Minimizes metadata**: Only needs phone number to register
- **No ads, no tracking pixels, no Facebook-level data collection**
- **Run by a nonprofit foundation**
- **Open-source code**: You don't have to trust the company—the code is public

The fact that intelligence agencies reportedly use Signal for sensitive communications speaks to its security.

## Getting Started (Practical Steps)

1. **Create new accounts**: Set up Proton Mail and install Signal. Use strong passwords and enable two-factor authentication.

2. **Migrate what matters**: Proton's "Easy Switch" can import old emails and contacts from Gmail. Forward incoming Gmail to Proton during transition.

3. **Notify contacts selectively**: You can announce your new address without constantly highlighting your old Gmail.

4. **Secure search and browsing**: Consider DuckDuckGo or Startpage for search, Brave or Firefox for browsing.

5. **Start Signal with close contacts**: Help them set it up. Pick important group chats first.

6. **Go at your own pace**: I shifted gradually—email first, then messaging, then search. Even just switching email is a significant win.

## Why This Matters

### The Stakes

- **Your data is yours**: Every message and photo should belong to you first. Encryption ensures only intended people can see it.
- **Companies don't get unlimited power**: Lawsuits show that leaving info with Big Tech is risky. Digital sovereignty means not accepting "take it or leave it" policies.
- **It's easier than ever**: Tools like Proton and Signal are user-friendly. You can use Signal out of the box with almost no impact to your privacy.

### The Broader Vision

This isn't paranoia—it's self-respect. Once you switch, there's a quiet freedom in knowing your conversations are private and your data isn't being used against you.

Digital sovereignty is ultimately about having power over your own "digital destiny." We can reclaim that power, bit by bit.

## Open Questions

- How do you bring people along without sounding paranoid or preachy?
- What's the balance between privacy and convenience—where are acceptable tradeoffs?
- How do you explain encryption to someone who thinks "I have nothing to hide"?
- When jurisdictions matter (Swiss law vs. US law), how do you communicate that simply?

## Key Formulations (Preserve These)

> "If you're not paying for a service, you are often the product."

> "Digital sovereignty means you decide what happens to your digital footprint. You aren't just a product for others to exploit."

> "Digital rights are human rights in our connected world."
