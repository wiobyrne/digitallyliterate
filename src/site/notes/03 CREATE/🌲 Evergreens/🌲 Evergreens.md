# Evergreen Notes

Evergreen notes are ideas that have been developed, tested, and refined over time. They represent my most considered thinking on a topic — the kind of notes I'd feel comfortable sharing, citing, or building on.

In the growth model of this garden:

- 🌱 **Seeds** are fragments and questions
- 🌿 **Plants** are developing connections
- 🌲 **Evergreens** are sturdy, reusable ideas

These notes aren't finished — nothing in a garden is. But they've been tended enough to stand on their own.

## What you'll find here

- Frameworks for thinking about digital literacy and education
- Arguments about AI, privacy, and technology ethics
- Pedagogical approaches and classroom strategies
- Theories connecting research to practice

## How to explore

Browse the file tree, or search for a topic. Each evergreen links to the seeds and plants that helped shape it, and to other evergreens that connect.
