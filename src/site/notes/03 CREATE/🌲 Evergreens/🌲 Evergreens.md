# 🌲 Evergreens

**Evergreens** are the finished products of my digital garden. These are the mature, polished, and ready-to-use frameworks that have grown from **[[02 DEVELOP/🌱 Seeds/🌱 Seeds\|🌱 Seeds]]** and been cultivated as **[[02 DEVELOP/🌿 Plants/🌿 Plants\|🌿 Plants]]**. They are my core insights and expertise, organized here for easy use.

You can review all current evergreens at the bottom of this note.

## The Cultivation Process
An evergreen note reaches its final form when it is:
- **Structurally Complete**: The framework has a clear, organized architecture and is fully documented.
- **Evidence-Based**: It is thoroughly supported by research, case studies, and real-world application.
- **Refined and Polished**: The content has been edited and refined to a professional, publication-ready standard.
- **Practically Tested**: The framework has been applied and tested, and its value has been validated.
- **Fully Integrated**: It is linked and contextualized within the larger network of my garden.
