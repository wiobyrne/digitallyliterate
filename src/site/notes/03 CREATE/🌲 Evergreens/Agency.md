# Agency

## Definition

**Agency** in the context of AI-mediated literacy practices refers to the student's capacity to make intentional, informed decisions about how to engage with AI tools. It encompasses:

- **Control** over the direction and scope of AI interactions
- **Choice** about when and how to use AI assistance
- **Responsibility** for evaluating and validating AI outputs
- **Authorship** in determining what appears in final work

Agency is not about avoiding AI, but about maintaining deliberate control over the collaboration.

---

## Theoretical Foundation

This conceptualization of agency draws from:

1. **Sociocultural theory** - Learners as active constructors of knowledge (Vygotsky, 1978)
2. **Critical literacy** - Agency as resistance to passive consumption (Freire, 1970)
3. **Human-computer interaction** - User agency in automated systems
4. **Mollick & Mollick (2023)** - Students must remain the "human in the loop"

## Dimensions of Agency in AI-Literacy Practice

### 1. Agency over Knowledge Base ([[03 CREATE/📊 Presentations/LRA 2025/Framework Component: Inputs (M&M)\|Framework Component: Inputs (M&M)]])
- Selecting sources that challenge or expand AI's context
- Curating materials that reflect critical perspectives
- Framing problems in ways that resist AI's defaults

### 2. Agency over Cognitive Task ([[03 CREATE/📊 Presentations/LRA 2025/Framework Component: Prompts (M&M)\|Framework Component: Prompts (M&M)]])
- Crafting complex prompts that demand thinking
- Constraining AI to prevent over-delegation
- Asking for critique, synthesis, or comparison (not just summary)

### 3. Agency over Output Evaluation ([[03 CREATE/📊 Presentations/LRA 2025/Framework Component: Outputs (M&M)\|Framework Component: Outputs (M&M)]])
- Critically assessing quality and bias
- Recognizing hallucinations or errors
- Deciding what merits trust

### 4. Agency over Final Product ([[03 CREATE/📊 Presentations/LRA 2025/Framework Component: Integration (M&M)\|Framework Component: Integration (M&M)]])
- Modifying, transforming, or rejecting AI text
- Maintaining ownership of intellectual work
- Ensuring human voice remains central

### 5. Metacognitive Agency ([[03 CREATE/📊 Presentations/LRA 2025/Framework Component: Reflection (M&M)\|Framework Component: Reflection (M&M)]])
- Articulating reasons for decisions
- Reflecting on ethical dimensions
- Positioning self as knowledge authority

## Indicators of High vs. Low Agency

| Indicator | High Agency | Low Agency |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| **Prompts** | Complex, constraining, directive | Generic, open-ended |
| **Integration** | Heavy modification/transformation | Copy-paste verbatim |
| **Evaluation** | Critical assessment, fact-checking | Uncritical acceptance |
| **Reflection** | Explicit boundary articulation | Minimal metacognition |
| **Stance** | "I used AI as a tool" | "AI did this for me" |

---

## Agency vs. Delegation

**Important distinction:**
- **Agency** = Intentional, bounded delegation with oversight
- **Over-delegation** = Relinquishing responsibility and critical evaluation

Students with high agency may delegate extensively while maintaining control through prompt design, evaluation, and transformation.

## Relationship to Other Concepts

- [[03 CREATE/🌲 Evergreens/Boundary-work\|Boundary-work]] - Agency is enacted through boundary-setting actions
- [[03 CREATE/🌲 Evergreens/Epistemic Stance\|Epistemic Stance]] - Agency reflects how students position themselves as knowers

## Evidence in This Study

[Add examples from student data showing high/low agency]

### Example: High Agency in Prompts
```
"Act as a critical reviewer of this argument. Identify logical
fallacies and suggest counterarguments."
```
(Demands thinking, sets constraints, maintains oversight)

### Example: Low Agency in Integration
```
[AI output inserted verbatim with no modification]
```
(No transformation, no voice, minimal authorship)

## Pedagogical Implications

Fostering agency in AI-literacy requires:
1. Explicit instruction in prompt design
2. Structured reflection on decision-making
3. Emphasis on human responsibility
4. Models of critical evaluation
5. Practice with modification and transformation
