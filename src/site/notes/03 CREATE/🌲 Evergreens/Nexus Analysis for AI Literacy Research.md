# Nexus Analysis for AI Literacy Research

## Overview

Nexus Analysis, developed by **Scollon and Scollon (2004)**, provides a methodological framework for examining AI-mediated literacy practices. Combined with **Wertsch's (1991) Mediational Means** concept, this approach treats digital interaction logs not as static transcripts but as time-stamped traces of social action.

---

## Core Constructs of Nexus Analysis

### 1. Historical Body

The accumulation of prior experiences, habits, and dispositions that participants bring to any social action.

**In AI literacy research:**
- Prior educational history (years of prohibition-oriented schooling)
- Previous experience with AI tools
- Professional identity formation
- Source curation patterns reflecting "grounding truths"

### 2. Interaction Order

The patterns of social arrangement and roles that govern how people interact in specific situations.

**In AI literacy research:**
- Turn-taking patterns between human and AI
- Prompt constraint and evolution
- Latency as "chronometric signal of deliberation"
- Recursive prompting behaviors

### 3. Discourses in Place

The broader cultural, institutional, and technological narratives circulating in the research setting.

**In AI literacy research:**
- Institutional AI policies (or lack thereof)
- Professional ethics surrounding authorship
- Cultural narratives about "cheating" and assistance
- Tensions between efficiency and authenticity

## The SPOC Model

A multi-dimensional analytical framework operationalizing Nexus Analysis for AI interaction study:

| SPOC Dimension | Focus Question | Critical AI Literacy Link | Observable Behavior |
|----------------|----------------|---------------------------|---------------------|
| **S**ource Selection | Did the student bound the AI's knowledge base? | Transparency & Accountability | Uploaded relevant domain-specific texts; references sources in prompts |
| **P**rompting Depth | Did the student use AI for cognitive enhancement? | Continuous Learning & Innovation | Iterative refinement; layered contextual prompts; professional personas |
| **O**utput Evaluation | Did the student demonstrate skepticism? | Exploration & Evaluation | Follow-up prompts for verification; bias detection; cross-referencing |
| **C**ritical Integration | Did final work maintain human voice? | Human-Centered Approach & Agency | Substantial revision; personal examples; rejection of generic content |

## Digital Trace Data Analysis

### Key Methodological Traces

1. **Latency**
   - The temporal gap between AI output and student intervention
   - Not "idling" but a chronometric signal of deliberation, critical reading, or repair labor
   - The "physical trace of cognitive friction in action"

2. **Prompt Evolution**
   - Longitudinal shift in prompt architecture and constraint
   - Reveals "trajectory of agency" - whether students mature toward orchestrated collaboration or default to algorithmic passivity

3. **Edit Distance**
   - Quantified divergence between raw AI output and final artifact
   - Forensic measure of "interpretive control"
   - Captures the "labor of re-authoring"

## Mapping Data to Theoretical Constructs

| Coding Component | Nexus Construct | Analytic Focus |
|------------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Inputs | Historical Body | Prior literacy habits, source curation, professional background |
| Prompts | Interaction Order | Constraint-setting, turn-taking, epistemic stance assertion |
| Outputs | Discourses in Place | Tool constraints, citation accuracy, "AI voice" |
| Integration | Boundary Work | Human transformation, rejection, synthetic re-authoring |
| Reflection | Societal Discourses | Ethical justification, legitimacy concerns, professional identity |

---

## Methodological Principles

1. **Process over Product**: Analysis focuses on interactional traces rather than final artifacts alone
2. **Visible Orientations**: Evidence must be interactionally visible, not inferred
3. **Digital Nexus Analysis**: Acknowledging analysis of mediated interaction rather than physical observation
4. **Triangulation**: Combining JSON logs with ethnographic reflections and participant annotations

---

## Practical Applications

### For Researchers
- Use time-stamped interaction logs (JSON format) to capture granular turn-by-turn evidence
- Code for pauses, revisions, and source-grounding behaviors
- Treat latency combined with high edit distance as "smoking gun" for critical AI literacy

### For Instructional Designers
- Design learning environments that make the "evaluative loop" visible
- Create structured reflection prompts that surface boundary work
- Build in pause-and-probe moments for deliberate AI engagement
