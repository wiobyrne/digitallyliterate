# Active Reading with Hypothesis

*A complete guide to web annotation for active, engaged reading*

---

## What is Hypothesis?

Hypothesis is a free, open-source annotation tool that lets you highlight and comment on any web page or PDF. Think of it like writing in the margins—but on the internet.

You can:
- Take private notes while reading online
- Join a group (like a class) to share highlights and responses
- Build a visible trail of thinking—"digital breadcrumbs"

> To annotate any page, use the Chrome extension, or simply paste the link into https://via.hypothes.is/

---

## Getting Started

1. **Create an account:** Go to https://hypothes.is/
2. **Install the Chrome extension** *(recommended)* or use `via.hypothes.is` as a prefix on any link
3. **Sign in and open the sidebar** by clicking the extension or visiting the "via" link
4. **Join your class group** if provided—this keeps annotations private to your learning community

---

## The Two Primary Annotation Types

- **Highlight** – marks a passage, like using a highlighter
- **Annotate** – lets you add a note (text, links, markdown, even images) to that highlight

> Use **tags** to connect themes, topics, or group research efforts.

---

## Active Reading Strategy (Tag-Based System)

Since Hypothesis doesn't use highlight colors, use **tags** and **annotation conventions** to replicate color-coded active reading.

| Purpose | Tag(s) | What to Write |
|---------|--------|---------------|
| **Main Ideas / Takeaways** | `main-idea`, `takeaway` | Summarize the author's central argument |
| **Vocabulary / Definitions** | `vocab`, `define` | Include the definition in your note |
| **Questions / Confusion** | `question`, `unclear` | Write your question; return later to answer |
| **Answered Questions** | `answered`, `resolved` | Reply to your own question with the answer |
| **Supporting Ideas / Connections** | `subpoint`, `connection` | Explain cross-textual connections |

Use multiple tags if needed (e.g., `main-idea, literacy`).

## Good Annotation Example

> **Highlight:** "Digital agency refers to one's ability to make choices in digital spaces."
>
> **Annotation:** This is the key takeaway from the section. It connects to our work on student autonomy.
>
> **Tags:** `main-idea`, `digital-agency`

---

## Classroom Implementation

### Minimum Requirements
- **Annotate at least 3 key passages per reading**
- For each passage, add:
  - An explanation of its significance
  - A connection to a class theme or another reading
- Use tags to label themes and annotation types

### Thematic Collection Activity
Choose a major theme and use Hypothesis to collect and annotate passages from different readings that relate to that theme. Share annotated collections for class discussion.

## Annotating YouTube Videos

YouTube videos can't be directly annotated, but you can annotate transcripts.

### Option 1: Use DocDrop
1. Copy the YouTube URL
2. Go to https://docdrop.org/
3. Paste the link—it generates a transcript page with Hypothesis enabled
4. Annotate the transcript as you would a normal article

### Option 2: YouTube Transcript Method
1. Open the video
2. Click the three dots (⋮) below the video → **Show transcript**
3. Copy the transcript to a Google Doc or paste into https://youtubetranscript.com/
4. Annotate using Hypothesis via the Via proxy tool

### Option 3: Embedded Video Pages
If a page has a YouTube video embedded with notes below it, annotate the surrounding text. Use timestamp references (e.g., "@2:34 — This is where they mention digital agency.")

---

## Reading Notes in Hypothesis

When you open the app, you have several options:

- **User icon** (top right): Sign out, modify account, or review public annotations
- **Share icon**: Share the page with Hypothesis prefix for collaborative annotation
- **"Public" link**: View/create public annotations or switch to a private group
- **Eye icon**: Hide/reveal highlights and annotations from others
- **Document icon**: Create a page-level note (vs. highlighting specific text)

---

## Tips for Success

- Revisit your annotations often—especially your questions
- Use **tags** consistently so you can filter by theme
- Keep notes clear and in *your own words*—this aids retention
- Your public annotation stream is available at `https://hypothes.is/stream?q=user:USERNAME`
