# 3Cs of consumption, creation, and critique

## Overview

The 3Cs framework represents a foundational approach to media literacy education that emphasizes active engagement with media content across three critical dimensions: consumption, creation, and critique. Rather than treating audiences as passive recipients of media messages, this framework positions learners as active participants who can thoughtfully engage with, produce, and analyze media in all its forms.

This comprehensive approach to media literacy education recognizes that in our digital age, individuals are simultaneously consumers, creators, and critics of media content. The 3Cs framework provides educators with a structured yet flexible approach to developing students' media literacy competencies while fostering critical thinking, creativity, and civic engagement.

## **Core Definition**  
The 3Cs of consumption, creation, and critique refer to three interconnected practices involved in media literacy: consuming (critically engaging with existing media content), creating (producing original media content), and critiquing (analyzing and evaluating media messages, structures, and impacts).

## **Explain Like I'm 5**  
Imagine you have a toy box filled with building blocks. First, you carefully look at and play with the toys that are already there (consumption). Then, you use those blocks to build something completely new and exciting (creation). Finally, you step back and think about which toys work best, which ones might be missing, and how your creation could be even better (critique).

## Theoretical Foundation

### Historical Context
The 3Cs framework builds upon decades of media literacy scholarship, drawing from:
- **Critical Media Literacy**: Paulo Freire's critical pedagogy applied to media education
- **Constructivist Learning Theory**: Students building knowledge through active engagement
- **Participatory Culture**: Henry Jenkins's work on collaborative media creation
- **Digital Citizenship**: Responsible participation in digital communities

### Pedagogical Principles
The framework is grounded in several key educational principles:
- **Active Learning**: Students engage directly with media rather than passively receiving instruction
- **Scaffolded Development**: Skills build progressively across the three domains
- **Authentic Assessment**: Learning demonstrated through real-world media practices
- **Social Construction**: Knowledge developed through collaborative inquiry and discussion
