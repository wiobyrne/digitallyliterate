# Privacy

## Overview

Privacy in the digital age represents one of the most fundamental rights and complex challenges of our interconnected world. Far from being merely about "having something to hide," privacy encompasses individual autonomy, democratic participation, human dignity, and the ability to develop authentic relationships and identities. As digital technologies become increasingly pervasive in every aspect of human life, understanding and protecting privacy has become essential for individual wellbeing, social justice, and democratic society.

Digital privacy involves the intersection of technology, law, ethics, and human behavior, requiring individuals, organizations, and societies to navigate complex tradeoffs between convenience, security, innovation, and fundamental rights. This comprehensive framework examines privacy from multiple perspectives, providing practical guidance for protecting personal information while engaging meaningfully in digital environments.

## **Core Definition**  
Privacy refers to an individual's fundamental right to control their personal information and determine how it is collected, used, shared, and stored. This includes the ability to maintain personal boundaries, protect sensitive information, and exercise autonomy over one's digital identity and personal data.

## **Explain Like I'm 5**  
Imagine privacy as your personal diary that you keep in a special box. You decide who gets to read it, what parts they can see, and when they can look at it. Privacy means you have the power to say "yes" or "no" when someone wants to know something about you, just like you can choose whether to share your toys or keep them private.

## Theoretical Foundations

### Historical Perspectives

**Warren and Brandeis (1890)**: The foundational legal concept of privacy as "the right to be let alone," emerging from concerns about newspaper intrusion into private life.
