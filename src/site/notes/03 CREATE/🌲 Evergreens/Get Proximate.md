# Get Proximate

## Core Principle
**To address societal problems effectively, get proximate—understand the human dynamics close to you and take action on what you can comprehend through authentic relationship and direct experience.**

## Foundational Definition  
Getting proximate means **intentionally moving closer** to the people and communities affected by particular issues in order to better understand and address their needs through sustained relationship-building, deep listening, and shared experience.

## The Proximity Imperative
As global challenges require local solutions, and as democratic institutions depend on informed civic participation, proximity becomes not just beneficial but essential for creating sustainable, equitable communities.

**The Path to Justice**: Proximity work requires patience, humility, and sustained commitment. Like all meaningful social change, its impact may not be immediately visible but accumulates over time through transformed relationships, shifted power dynamics, and communities empowered to create their own solutions.
