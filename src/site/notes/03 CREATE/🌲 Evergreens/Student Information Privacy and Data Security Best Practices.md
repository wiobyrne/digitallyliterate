# Student Information Privacy and Data Security Best Practices

## Summary
The Software & Information Industry in February 2014, released five industry “best practices” to aid in protecting student information privacy and data security. The guidelines were designed to advance the effective use of technology in education and include: use for educational purposes, transparency, authorization, security, and data breach notification.

## Core Content
- **Educational Purpose:** Personal Identifiable Information (PII) of students should only be collected for educational purposes as directed by the institution adhering to state and federal laws.
- **Transparency:** Providers should disclose what kinds of PII are collected from students and how this information is used or shared with third parties in their contracts or privacy policies.
- **Authorization:** Collection, usage or sharing of student PII should only be done as per the provider's privacy policies and contracts with the educational institutions they serve, or with consent from students or parents as authorized by law.
- **Security:** Providers should have security policies and procedures designed to protect student information against risks such as unauthorized access/use or inappropriate destruction/modification/disclosure.
- **Data Breach Notification:** In case of a data breach, providers should have reasonable policies and procedures including notifying educational institutions. If there is a substantial risk of harm from the breach or a legal duty to provide notification, they should support institutions in notifying affected individuals.
