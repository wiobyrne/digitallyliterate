# COIL and Global Pedagogy Framework

*A four-stage educator development pathway for international teaching and cross-border collaboration*

---

## What is COIL?

**Collaborative Online International Learning (COIL)** is a pedagogical approach that connects students and faculty from different countries through shared coursework, projects, and dialogue. Unlike study abroad programs, COIL brings global perspectives into regular courses without requiring travel.

---

## Four-Stage Educator Development Pathway

### Stage 1: Awareness
- Introduction to global pedagogy concepts
- Understanding digital divide implications
- Recognizing cultural and linguistic diversity in learning

### Stage 2: Exploration
- Platform selection and evaluation (using AAPP Framework)
- Identifying potential partner institutions
- Developing translanguaging strategies

### Stage 3: Implementation
- Co-designing curriculum with international partners
- Managing time zones, technology access, and cultural expectations
- Building authentic assessment for cross-cultural collaboration

### Stage 4: Advocacy
- Mentoring other faculty in COIL practices
- Contributing to Faculty Learning Communities (FLCs)
- Publishing and presenting on global pedagogy

---

## Faculty Learning Community (FLC) Structure

FLCs provide ongoing support for educators developing global pedagogy skills.

### Meeting Cadence
- Monthly gatherings (90 minutes)
- Rotating facilitation among members
- Mix of skill-building and reflection

### Core Topics for FLC Sessions
1. Platform equity audits (Access, Accessibility, Privacy, Pedagogy)
2. Translanguaging and multilingual support strategies
3. Designing for asynchronous collaboration across time zones
4. Assessment approaches that honor diverse ways of knowing
5. Navigating institutional barriers to international partnerships

## Equity-Centered Course Design Checklist

Before launching a COIL module, audit your design:

### Access
- [ ] Do all students have reliable internet access?
- [ ] Are materials available offline or low-bandwidth?
- [ ] Have you accounted for device diversity?

### Accessibility
- [ ] Are all materials screen-reader compatible?
- [ ] Do videos have captions in multiple languages?
- [ ] Are synchronous sessions recorded for later viewing?

### Privacy
- [ ] Does the platform comply with international data regulations?
- [ ] Are student data shared across borders appropriately?
- [ ] Have you discussed digital privacy with students?

### Pedagogy
- [ ] Does the design honor diverse epistemologies?
- [ ] Are assessment criteria culturally responsive?
- [ ] Is there space for translanguaging and multimodal expression?

## Translanguaging in Global Classrooms

Translanguaging acknowledges that multilingual learners draw on their full linguistic repertoire, not just the "target" language.

### Practical Strategies
- Allow code-switching in discussion forums
- Invite students to submit drafts in their strongest language first
- Use collaborative translation as a learning activity
- Value multilingual glossaries created by students

---

## Platform Selection Considerations

When choosing technology for international collaboration:

| Criterion | Questions to Ask |
|-----------|------------------|
| **Accessibility** | Is it available in all partner countries? Blocked anywhere? |
| **Data Privacy** | Where is data stored? What are the privacy policies? |
| **Cost** | Are there fees that disadvantage some students? |
| **Usability** | Does it work on low-bandwidth connections? |
| **Openness** | Can you export student work? Is it federated? |

### Recommended Approaches
- Prefer open, federated platforms where possible
- Avoid tools that require specific payment methods not available globally
- Test with partner institutions before launch

## Key Challenges and Solutions

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| Time zone coordination | Asynchronous-first design with optional synchronous "office hours" |
| Language barriers | Translanguaging support; collaborative translation |
| Technology access | Low-bandwidth options; offline materials |
| Cultural misunderstandings | Explicit cultural exchange activities; reflection prompts |
| Assessment equity | Multiple pathways to demonstrate learning |
