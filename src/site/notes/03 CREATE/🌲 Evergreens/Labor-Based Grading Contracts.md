# Labor-Based Grading Contracts

## Philosophy

Labor-based grading contracts prioritize deep engagement and clinical reflection over point accumulation. The approach is grounded in the belief that:

- Literacy and classroom management are social practices tied to power, identity, and relationships
- Student agency, growth, and risk-taking matter more than external compliance
- Grade anxiety undermines genuine learning
- Professional practice requires iteration, not perfection

---

## Core Evaluation System

### Satisfactory / Needs Revision

Following an "ungrading" philosophy, individual assignments are not given numerical scores. Instead, all work is evaluated as either:

| Evaluation | Meaning |
|------------|---------|
| **Satisfactory** | Meets the professional criteria outlined in the assignment prompt |
| **Needs Revision** | Does not yet meet the criteria, but can be revised |

**Key principle**: There is no partial credit. Work is revised until it meets the standard.

## Grade Bundle Structure

Think of your grade as a **building process**, not a competition:

- Everyone begins with the foundation
- To earn a higher grade, you add additional layers of work
- You choose the tier you aim for and complete the required labor

### Tier 1: Foundation (Grade C)

Complete these core tasks:
1. Weekly "See" Log (Readings & Observation)
2. Simulations/Modules (e.g., IRIS modules, SchoolSims)
3. Short Online Exams (Praxis/certification preparation)

**What This Demonstrates**: You have mastered foundational concepts and core course expectations.

### Tier 2: Engagement (Grade B)

Tier 1 PLUS:
4. Audio/Reflection component (e.g., PERMA lens, voice notes)
5. Community-Building component (e.g., collaborative video, peer engagement)

**What This Demonstrates**: You have engaged in deeper reflection and collaborative meaning-making.

### Tier 3: Capstone (Grade A)

Tiers 1 & 2 PLUS:
6. Principles & Practices Demo (Multimedia Teaching Resource)
7. Final Portfolio (polished professional artifact)

**What This Demonstrates**: You have created professional leadership resources for the field.

## The Rules of the Contract

### Satisfactory Standard
To count toward your selected bundle, an assignment must meet the specifications outlined in the assignment prompt.

### Revision Policy
If an assignment is marked "Needs Revision," you have **one week** to revise and resubmit to meet the Satisfactory standard.

### "Life Happens" Allowance
You may miss **two weekly deadlines** for any reason without penalty. No explanation is required.

### Attendance & Activity
- Missing a weekly Sunday deadline (beyond your allowance) counts as an absence
- Inactivity for more than five consecutive days triggers contract review
- More than two missed deadlines beyond allowance puts contract "out of fulfillment"

---

## Final Grade Claim

At the end of the semester, you submit a **Final Reflection & Grade Claim**:

1. Review your work across the semester
2. Provide evidence that you completed your chosen grade bundle
3. Formally claim the letter grade you have earned

The instructor's role is to **verify the claim**, not to surprise you with a grade.

## Implementation in D2L/OAKS

### Creating the Grade Scheme

1. Access **Grades** > **Schemes** tab
2. Create new scheme with thresholds:

| Symbol | Start % | Color |
|--------|---------|-------|
| Satisfactory | 100% | Green |
| Needs Revision | 0% | Yellow |

3. Optional: Add "Incomplete" or "Missing" symbol at 0%
4. Apply scheme to assignment folders

### Grading Workflow

- Enter **100** for satisfactory work (displays as "Satisfactory")
- Enter **0** or leave empty for work needing revision (displays as "Needs Revision")
- Add revision feedback in comments

---

## Communicating to Students

### Addressing Unfamiliarity

Sample framing:

> "I know that ungrading or labor-based grading can feel unfamiliar. My teaching is grounded in the belief that literacy and classroom management are social practices tied to power, identity, and relationships. Because of that, I prioritize your agency, growth, and risk-taking over external compliance or point accumulation."

### Key Messages

- **You are in control**: You choose how much labor to take on and which grade to aim for
- **Revision is expected**: "Needs Revision" is not failure - it's part of the learning process
- **The work, not the points**: Focus on learning and professional practice rather than grade accumulation
- **No surprises**: Your final grade is claimed based on completed labor, not instructor judgment

---

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Reduces grade anxiety**: Students focus on learning rather than point-chasing
2. **Normalizes revision**: All professional work involves iteration
3. **Honors different capacities**: Students choose tiers based on current life circumstances
4. **Builds professional habits**: Work-until-satisfactory mirrors professional expectations
5. **Transparent expectations**: Clear criteria eliminate ambiguity

---

## Potential Challenges

| Challenge | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Students unfamiliar with approach | Provide video explanation, FAQ, ongoing discussion |
| "Gaming" the minimum tier | Tier 1 represents genuine foundation; additional tiers are opportunities, not requirements |
| Students miss deadlines | "Life Happens" allowance plus clear communication about fulfillment |
| Determining "Satisfactory" | Clear rubrics/checklists for each assignment |
