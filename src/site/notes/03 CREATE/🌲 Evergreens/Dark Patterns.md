# Dark Patterns

## **Definition**  
Dark Patterns are deceptive techniques used in websites and apps designed to trick users into doing things they might not otherwise do, such as buying or signing up for something.

## **Explain Like I'm 5**  
Let's say you're playing a game and it tells you that you can get a free toy if you press a big, flashy button. But when you press it, it actually signs you up for a monthly toy subscription that costs money. That's what dark patterns do – they trick you!

## **Digging Deeper**
Dark Patterns are manipulative design tactics used in user interfaces (UI) to deceive users. They often take advantage of the gap between user understanding and system functionality, leading users towards actions that may not be in their best interest. These tactics can include confusing language, hidden costs or subscription details, misleading visual cues, and other forms of manipulation. Dark patterns exploit cognitive biases and can lead to negative user experiences and unethical outcomes.

For example, one common dark pattern is 'bait-and-switch', where the user sets out to do one thing but is steered towards another action by the design of the interface.

## **Applications**  
- **E-commerce websites**: Some online retailers use dark patterns to trick customers into buying more items or signing up for recurring purchases.
- **Social media platforms**: Dark patterns may be used to keep users engaged for longer periods or make it difficult to change privacy settings.
- **Online subscriptions**: Some services use dark patterns to make it hard for customers to cancel subscriptions.
