# AI Illiteracy

## Overview

AI illiteracy represents a critical gap in 21st-century literacy skills, encompassing the lack of understanding about artificial intelligence systems, their capabilities, limitations, and societal implications. As AI becomes increasingly integrated into daily life, education, and professional contexts, AI illiteracy poses significant risks to individual agency, democratic participation, and equitable access to opportunities.

AI illiteracy is not simply about technical knowledge; it encompasses understanding how AI affects decision-making, recognizing AI-generated content, comprehending algorithmic bias, and developing critical thinking skills for navigating an AI-mediated world. Addressing AI illiteracy is essential for preparing citizens to participate effectively in an increasingly automated society.

## **Definition**  
AI illiteracy refers to a lack of understanding about artificial intelligence systems, their capabilities, limitations, and societal implications, resulting in an inability to critically evaluate, appropriately use, or effectively navigate AI-mediated environments.

## **Explain Like I'm 5**  
Imagine AI is like a very smart helper that can answer questions, make pictures, and solve problems. AI illiteracy is when people don't understand how these helpers work, what they're good at, what they can't do, or when they might make mistakes. It's like not knowing that a calculator can do math but can't tell you if your answer makes sense in real life.
