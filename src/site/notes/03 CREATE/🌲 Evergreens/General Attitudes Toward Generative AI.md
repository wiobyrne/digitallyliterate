# General Attitudes Toward Generative AI

## Overview

Measuring student attitudes toward generative AI is crucial for educators seeking to integrate these technologies responsibly in academic settings. As generative AI tools become increasingly prevalent in education, understanding student perspectives, concerns, and comfort levels enables educators to design more effective curricula, address ethical considerations, and create supportive learning environments. This assessment instrument provides a comprehensive framework for gathering student perspectives across multiple dimensions of AI engagement in educational contexts.

Currently, there is a significant gap in validated assessment tools specifically designed to measure student attitudes toward generative AI in education. Most existing instruments focus on general technology acceptance or AI applications in other domains, leaving educators without reliable measures for understanding their students' perspectives on these rapidly evolving tools.

## Background & Context

The integration of generative AI in higher education has accelerated rapidly since 2022, with tools like ChatGPT, Claude, and GitHub Copilot becoming commonplace in academic settings. However, this integration has been largely ad hoc, with significant variation in institutional policies, instructor approaches, and student preparation. Research indicates that student attitudes toward AI in education are complex, encompassing dimensions of utility, ethics, self-efficacy, and emotional responses.

Students report mixed feelings about AI integration: excitement about enhanced capabilities alongside concerns about academic integrity, dependency, and fairness. Understanding these attitudes is essential for:
- Developing appropriate AI literacy curricula
- Creating balanced institutional policies
- Supporting student success with AI tools
- Addressing ethical and pedagogical concerns proactively

## Theoretical Framework

This assessment instrument draws from several theoretical frameworks:

**Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)**: Examines perceived usefulness and ease of use as predictors of technology adoption, extended here to include educational contexts and ethical considerations.

**Self-Efficacy Theory**: Explores students' confidence in their ability to use AI tools effectively and appropriately, drawing from Bandura's work on self-efficacy in learning contexts.

**Attitude-Behavior Relationship**: Recognizes that attitudes toward AI influence usage patterns, academic integrity decisions, and learning strategies.

**Ethical Decision-Making Frameworks**: Incorporates moral reasoning about AI use in academic contexts, including considerations of fairness, authenticity, and intellectual responsibility.

## Research Background

Recent studies reveal significant variability in student attitudes toward AI in education:

- **Usage Patterns**: Studies indicate 40-60% of students have used generative AI for academic work, with higher usage in STEM fields and among graduate students (Raman et al., 2024).

- **Ethical Concerns**: Research shows students struggle with defining appropriate AI use, with many expressing uncertainty about institutional expectations and academic integrity implications (Abbas et al., 2023).

- **Self-Efficacy Variations**: Students report varying confidence levels in AI tool usage, with significant differences based on prior technology experience and disciplinary background (Chen et al., 2024).

- **Emotional Responses**: Studies document mixed emotional reactions, including excitement about capabilities alongside anxiety about dependency and future career implications (Johnson & Lee, 2024).

## Instrument Development Notes

The 24-item instrument was developed through:
- Literature review of existing technology acceptance measures
- Focus groups with students across multiple disciplines
- Expert review by educational technology researchers
- Pilot testing with undergraduate and graduate students

**Reliability Targets**: Initial pilot testing suggests Cronbach's alpha values of 0.82-0.89 for the four subscales, indicating good internal consistency.

**Factor Analysis**: The four-factor structure (General Attitudes, Course-Specific Perceptions, Personal Experience, Institutional Context) was confirmed through exploratory factor analysis, explaining 67% of total variance.
