# Idea Capture and Development Workflow

*A system for capturing ideas and developing them into mature, publishable content*

---

## The Development Pipeline

```
📥 Inbox → 🌱 Seeds → 🌿 Plants → 🌲 Evergreen
```

Ideas progress through stages of development, from raw captures to authoritative reference material.

---

## Stage 1: Immediate Capture (📥 Inbox)

**When**: You have a quick thought, insight, or question
**How**: Create new note in Inbox folder
**Template**: None—just capture!

### Capture Format
```markdown
# [Descriptive title of the idea]

[Raw thought, question, or insight]

Source: [Where this came from - conversation, book, observation]
Context: [Why this matters or what triggered it]
Related: [Any obvious connections to existing knowledge]
```

**Time Investment**: 30 seconds to 2 minutes maximum

### Key Principles
- Speed over structure
- Capture now, process later
- Maximum 48-hour residence time in inbox

---

## Stage 2: Daily Processing (📥 → 🌱)

**When**: During daily inbox review (5-10 minutes)
**Decision Point**: Is this worth developing into a Seed?

### Promote to Seed If:
- Novel or interesting concept
- Potential for development
- Connects to your knowledge domains
- Worth future exploration

### Other Actions:
- **File elsewhere**: If it's reference material (→ CONSUME folders)
- **Add to existing note**: If it extends current content
- **Delete**: If no longer relevant

---

## Stage 3: Seed Development (🌱)

**When**: Ready to explore the idea properly
**How**: Apply Seed metadata and develop

### Key Activities
- Proper YAML metadata
- Initial research and connections
- Questions for exploration
- Development planning

**Target**: 500-3,000 words of exploration

### Seed Characteristics
- Single insight, question, or observation
- Initial connections identified
- Questions documented for future exploration
- Not yet structured into a framework

---

## Stage 4: Plant Growth (🌿)

**When**: Seed reaches 5,000+ words and has framework potential
**How**: Promote to Plant with structured analysis

### Key Activities
- Framework development
- Practical applications
- Comprehensive connections
- Professional quality analysis

**Target**: 5,000+ words with clear structure

### Plant Characteristics
- Multiple connected ideas
- Emerging structure/framework
- Active development in progress
- Beginning to be useful to others

---

## Stage 5: Evergreen Maturity (🌲)

**When**: Plant reaches 10,000+ words and authoritative status
**How**: Promote to Evergreen as definitive reference

### Key Activities
- Authoritative analysis
- Extensive cross-references
- Publishing-ready quality
- Network centrality

**Target**: 10,000+ words, professional quality

### Evergreen Characteristics
- Complete thoughts, ready for publishing/sharing
- Authoritative reference on the topic
- Central node in knowledge network
- Stable but can still be updated

---

## Content Type Decision Tree

### External Content (Direct to Templates)
| Content Type | Destination |
|--------------|-------------|
| Book | Book Template |
| Paper | Paper Template |
| Video | Video Template |
| Web Article | Webpage Template |
| Person | People Template |

### Original Ideas (Inbox Pipeline)
```
Quick Idea → Inbox (no template)
           ↓ (daily review)
         Seed Template
           ↓ (development)
         Plant Template
           ↓ (maturity)
       Evergreen Template
```

---

## Template Usage Guidelines

### When to Skip Templates
- **Inbox capture**: Speed over structure
- **Quick references**: Just need to save a link
- **Meeting notes**: Use Meeting Template instead

### When Templates are Essential
- **Development pipeline**: Seeds, Plants, Evergreens
- **Structured content**: Books, Papers, formal analysis
- **Publishing preparation**: Blog posts, newsletters
- **System management**: Reviews, processing sessions

---

## Processing Time Guidelines

| Stage | Time Investment |
|-------|-----------------|
| Inbox capture | 30 seconds - 2 minutes |
| Seed creation | 10-30 minutes |
| Plant development | 1-3 hours |
| Evergreen creation | 3-8 hours |

---

## Practical Example

### Quick Idea (Inbox Capture)
```markdown
# Students struggling with AI tool evaluation

Noticed in class today - students can use ChatGPT but can't
assess if the output is good. They need evaluation frameworks,
not just prompting skills.

Source: ENGL 101 class observation
Context: Assignment review session
```

### Later → Seed Development
```markdown
---
title: "AI Output Evaluation Frameworks for Students"
status: 🌱_seed
tags:
  - ai-literacy
  - critical-thinking
  - student-assessment
---

# AI Output Evaluation Frameworks for Students

## Core Concept
Students need structured approaches to evaluate AI-generated
content quality, accuracy, and appropriateness rather than
just accepting outputs uncritically.

```

---

## Key Principle

> Templates provide structure when you're ready to develop content properly. For quick capture, prioritize speed over structure, then apply templates during focused processing time.
