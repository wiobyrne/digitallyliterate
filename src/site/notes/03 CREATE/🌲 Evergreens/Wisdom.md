The cultivation of wisdom is both a personal and collective endeavor. Individual wisdom contributes to collective wisdom, and collective wisdom supports individual development. By understanding wisdom as the tolerance of cognitive dissonance and working to develop this capacity in ourselves and others, we can create more thoughtful, compassionate, and effective responses to the challenges and opportunities of our time.
