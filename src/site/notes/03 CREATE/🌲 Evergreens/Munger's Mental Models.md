# Munger's Mental Models

## Comprehensive Framework for Multidisciplinary Decision-Making

### Core Philosophy: Multidisciplinary Thinking

**Foundation Principle**
Charlie Munger advocates for developing a "latticework of mental models" drawn from multiple disciplines to improve decision-making and avoid cognitive errors. This approach recognizes that reality is complex and interconnected, requiring diverse analytical tools and perspectives for accurate understanding.

**Inversion as Key Tool**
Munger particularly emphasizes algebraic inversion—solving problems by approaching them backwards. Instead of asking "How do we succeed?" ask "How do we fail?" This technique helps identify risks and obstacles that forward-thinking might miss.
