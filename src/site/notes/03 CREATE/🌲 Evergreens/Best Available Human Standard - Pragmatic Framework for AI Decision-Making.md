# Best Available Human Standard - Pragmatic Framework for AI Decision-Making

## Executive Summary

The "Best Available Human" (BAH) standard represents a pragmatic framework for AI decision-making developed by Ethan Mollick that fundamentally shifts evaluation criteria from comparing AI to perfect human performance toward assessing AI against actual available human resources. This framework challenges both AI optimism and pessimism by focusing on practical implementation questions: "Is the AI better or worse than the best human you have access to at that moment?" The BAH standard has emerged as a critical tool for navigating AI adoption in resource-constrained environments, workplace transformation, and global development contexts while raising important questions about learning pathways and professional development in an AI-augmented future.

## Conclusion

The Best Available Human standard offers a valuable lens for navigating the complex terrain of AI adoption, providing a pragmatic alternative to perfectionist approaches while requiring thoughtful implementation that considers broader social implications and commitment to preserving human capabilities alongside technological advancement.
