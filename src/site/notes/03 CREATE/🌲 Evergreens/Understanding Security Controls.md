# Understanding Security Controls

Security controls are safeguards or countermeasures that are employed to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data and information systems. These measures can be physical, technical or administrative. They are critical in preventing security breaches or minimizing damage when breaches occur.

Security controls can be classified into three categories:

1. **Preventive Controls:** These are designed to prevent an incident from occurring (e.g., locks on doors, requiring passwords to access systems).

2. **Detective Controls:** These aim to identify and react appropriately to any incidents that occur (e.g., intrusion detection systems, surveillance cameras).

3. **Corrective Controls:** These controls limit the extent of any damage caused by an incident (e.g., disaster recovery plans).

It's essential for organizations to have a mix of these control types for an effective security system. The choice of security controls is usually guided by a risk assessment that identifies potential threats and vulnerabilities.

Implementing security controls requires careful planning and regular reviews to ensure their effectiveness. Regular audits can help identify weaknesses in the system that need improvement.

 Risks are inherent in every enterprise.  Variables, change initiatives, and processes associated with daily operations of any school system inevitably accrue levels of risk that must be managed.  But how can we manage risk?  It's a matter of making decisions and being prepared.  

1.  Start by determining what could go wrong.  
2.  Then, determine the immediate and long-term impact of the potential breach.
3.  Next, make a plan to do the most you can to prevent the circumstances that may lead to the breach as well as control the aftermath.
4.  In the case of an incident or event, determine the scope of the matter and implement your plan.
5.  Reflect and evaluate your response.

As you can see, there are many decisions that need to be made when it comes to risk management.  You need to identify vulnerabilities, the impact of threats, and cost-effective mitigations for such risks.  These mitigations are referred to as **security controls**--elements or practices used to reduce risks.

Understanding the concept of security controls is key in the field of information security, as it provides a framework for defending against cyber threats.
