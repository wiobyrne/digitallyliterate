# Data Minimization

## **Definition**

Data minimization refers to the practice of collecting and retaining only the necessary amount of data needed for a specific purpose, reducing the risk of privacy breaches and unauthorized access.

## **Explain Like I'm 5**

Imagine you have a toy box with lots of toys in it. Data minimization is like only taking out the toys you need to play with and putting the rest back in the box. This way, you only have what you need and keep everything else safe.

## **Digging Deeper**

Data minimization is an important concept in data privacy and security. By only collecting and storing essential data, organizations can reduce the amount of sensitive information at risk. This practice aligns with principles like data protection laws (e.g., GDPR) that emphasize limiting personal data processing to what is strictly necessary for a specific purpose. For example, a healthcare provider may only store a patient's medical history and treatment plan instead of gathering unnecessary details like social security numbers or personal preferences.

## **Applications**

- E-commerce: Online retailers can implement data minimization by only storing customer information necessary for processing orders and providing customer support, reducing the risk of data breaches.
- Healthcare: Hospitals and clinics can apply data minimization by limiting patient records to medical history, current treatments, and relevant diagnostic tests, ensuring sensitive health information is safeguarded.
- Financial Services: Banks and financial institutions can practice data minimization by securely managing customer account details while minimizing unnecessary collection of personal information not required for financial transactions.
- Mobile Apps: App developers can adhere to data minimization principles by requesting minimal permissions from users to access device features or personal data, promoting user privacy.
- Internet of Things (IoT): IoT device manufacturers can design products with built-in privacy features that limit the collection and storage of user data to essential functions only.
