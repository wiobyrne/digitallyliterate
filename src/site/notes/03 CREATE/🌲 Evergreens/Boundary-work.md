# Boundary-work

## Definition

**Boundary-work** refers to the active process through which students negotiate, define, and maintain the boundaries between human and AI contributions in collaborative knowledge construction. It encompasses the decisions students make about:

- What tasks to delegate to AI vs. complete themselves
- Where to draw lines of authority and responsibility
- How to integrate, modify, or reject AI outputs
- When to intervene in or override AI suggestions

---

## Theoretical Foundation

The concept of boundary-work in this research draws from:

1. **Gieryn's (1983) boundary-work in science studies** - How actors demarcate legitimate from illegitimate knowledge
2. **Human-AI collaboration literature** - Particularly around maintaining "human in the loop" principles
3. **Mollick & Mollick (2023)** - The imperative that students must remain the human in the loop and actively oversee AI outputs

## Evidence of Boundary-work in This Study

Boundary-work manifests in observable student actions:

### Types of Boundary-work Actions

| Action | Description | Evidence of |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **Restriction** | Limiting what the AI can do through prompt constraints | High boundary awareness |
| **Correction** | Identifying and fixing AI errors or bias | Critical evaluation |
| **Refusal** | Rejecting AI output entirely | Strong epistemic stance |
| **Modification** | Transforming AI text before use | Active authorship |
| **Attribution** | Explicitly marking AI vs. human contributions | Ethical transparency |

## Connection to Other Concepts

- [[03 CREATE/🌲 Evergreens/Agency\|Agency]] - Boundary-work is an expression of student agency
- [[03 CREATE/🌲 Evergreens/Epistemic Stance\|Epistemic Stance]] - The boundaries students draw reveal their stance on knowledge authority
