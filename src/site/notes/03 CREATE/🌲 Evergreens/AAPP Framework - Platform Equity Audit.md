# AAPP Framework - Platform Equity Audit

## Overview

The **AAPP Framework** (Access, Accessibility, Privacy, and Pedagogy) provides a comprehensive audit structure for evaluating educational technology through an equity lens. This framework moves beyond mere compliance with platform restrictions toward proactive advocacy for federated, privacy-forward architectures.

---

## The Four Pillars

### Access

| Current Standard | Equity-Centered Goal |
|------------------|----------------------|
| Is the platform blocked in this country/district? | Is it owned by a monopoly that exploits user data? |
| Can students log in? | Does access require surrendering personal information? |
| Is there a free tier available? | Are there hidden costs (data extraction, attention economy)? |

**Key Questions:**
- Who owns this platform and what are their business incentives?
- What happens to user data when the platform is sold or sunsets?
- Does the platform create dependencies that limit future choices?

### Accessibility

| Current Standard | Equity-Centered Goal |
|------------------|----------------------|
| Does it have alt-text for images? | Is it available in local languages without translation lag? |
| Is it screen-reader compatible? | Does it support diverse modalities of participation? |
| Does it meet WCAG standards? | Can it be used on low-bandwidth connections? |

**Key Questions:**
- Does the platform assume specific technological infrastructure?
- Are multilingual and multimodal participation genuinely supported?
- Who is excluded by default design choices?

### Privacy

| Current Standard | Equity-Centered Goal |
|------------------|----------------------|
| Is it GDPR/COPPA/FERPA compliant? | Is it **federated**? Do users own their own data? |
| Does it have a privacy policy? | Is the architecture privacy-by-design? |
| Can users delete their data? | Does it avoid behavioral tracking and profiling? |

**Key Questions:**
- Where does user data reside and who controls it?
- Is the platform surveillance-free by architecture, not just policy?
- Could users migrate to self-hosted alternatives if needed?

### Pedagogy

| Current Standard | Equity-Centered Goal |
|------------------|----------------------|
| Does the tool work for the lesson? | Does the tool's architecture reflect democratic values? |
| Does it support learning objectives? | Does it foster agency or create dependency? |
| Is it engaging for students? | Does it prepare students for critical digital citizenship? |

**Key Questions:**
- Does using this platform teach implicit lessons about surveillance and consent?
- Are students learning to be consumers or creators of digital spaces?
- Does the pedagogy require this specific platform, or could alternatives work?

## Moving from Compliance to Transformation

The AAPP framework distinguishes between two orientations:

### Compliance Orientation (Navigation)
- "What is the legal landscape of these platforms?"
- Focuses on surviving within existing Big Tech ecosystems
- Asks: "How do we avoid violating policies?"

### Transformation Orientation (Liberation)
- "How do we move away from these landscapes entirely?"
- Advocates for the Fediverse and decentralized models
- Asks: "How do we build digital sovereignty?"

---

## Federated, Privacy-Forward Alternatives

### What "Federated" Means
- Decentralized architecture (no single point of control)
- Communities control their own servers and governance
- Data stays with users rather than platform owners
- Examples: Mastodon, Matrix, Nextcloud, Pixelfed

### Why This Matters for Education
- **Digital colonialism**: Designing programs that rely on Big Tech monopolies forces educators in the Global South into extractive relationships
- **Zero-rating programs**: In many regions, "the internet" is synonymous with Facebook or Google
- **Digital sovereignty**: Communities deserve to control their own digital infrastructure

## Implementation Guidance

### Before Adopting a Platform
1. Conduct AAPP audit using the questions above
2. Investigate ownership structure and business model
3. Identify federated or self-hosted alternatives
4. Consider what implicit curriculum the platform teaches
5. Create co-created community agreements for platform governance

### Integration with Multilingual Communities
- Equity-centered choices should prioritize multilingual participation
- Pair platform selection with co-created agreements for:
  - Platform governance
  - Language use norms
  - Conflict resolution procedures

## The "De-Googled" Lens

A fully equity-centered AAPP audit specifically defines "Privacy" and "Access" through a de-googled perspective:

> "Educators should conduct a platform equity audit of Access, Accessibility, Privacy, and Pedagogy (AAPP) to ensure alignment with these values. **This goes beyond mere compliance with existing platform restrictions; it requires a proactive move toward federated, privacy-forward architectures that challenge Big Tech monopolies and support local digital sovereignty.**"
