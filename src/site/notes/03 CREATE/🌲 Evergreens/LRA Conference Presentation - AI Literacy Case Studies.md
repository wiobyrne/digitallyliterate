# LRA Conference Presentation - AI Literacy Case Studies

*Conference presentation strategy using case study storytelling and the SPOC model*

---

## Presentation Overview

**Venue:** Literacy Research Association (LRA) Annual Conference
**Format:** 15-20 minute paper session
**Approach:** Qualitative case study with visual framework

---

## Presentation Structure

### Opening Hook (2 minutes)
Start with a concrete moment from the data:
> "At 2:47 PM on a Tuesday in October, a pre-service teacher named Maya typed her third revision of a prompt into NotebookLM. Her first two attempts had been rejected—not by the AI, but by Maya herself."

This moment of **self-correction** becomes the entry point for discussing agency in AI-mediated literacy work.

### Theoretical Framing (3 minutes)
- Position AI as **mediational means** (Wertsch, 1991)
- Introduce Nexus Analysis (Scollon & Scollon, 2004)
- Explain why interaction logs are the appropriate data source

### The SPOC Model (5 minutes)
Introduce the four-dimensional analytical framework:

| Dimension | Focus | Key Questions |
|-----------|-------|---------------|
| **S**ource | What sources did the learner curate? | How specific? How bounded? |
| **P**rompt | How did the learner construct prompts? | What constraints were applied? |
| **O**utput | How was AI output received? | Accepted, revised, or rejected? |
| **C**ritique | What evaluative moves occurred? | How was quality assessed? |

### Case Study Findings (7 minutes)
Present the two contrasting profiles:

**The Orchestrator**
- Iterative correction loops
- Active constraint-setting
- Rejection and revoicing of AI output
- High latency (deliberation time)

**The Outsourcer**
- Linear, single-pass interactions
- Minimal prompt refinement
- Early acceptance of AI output
- Low latency

Use specific examples from interaction logs to illustrate each profile.

### Implications (3 minutes)
- What this means for teacher education
- Pedagogical design for AI literacy
- Future research directions

### Slide 2: Orchestrator vs. Outsourcer Comparison
Two-column visual showing:
- Interaction log screenshots (anonymized)
- Latency comparisons
- Revision frequency

### Slide 3: Trajectory of Agency
Timeline showing how a single learner's interaction patterns evolved over the semester.

## Anticipated Questions

**Q: How do you account for task difficulty affecting interaction patterns?**
A: We controlled for this by analyzing interactions across multiple task types and noting that profiles remained relatively stable.

**Q: Is the "Outsourcer" profile necessarily negative?**
A: Not inherently. Context matters. For some tasks, efficient delegation may be appropriate. The concern is when it becomes the default mode regardless of task demands.

**Q: How generalizable are these findings?**
A: As qualitative case studies, we don't claim generalizability. We offer transferability—readers can assess applicability to their contexts.
