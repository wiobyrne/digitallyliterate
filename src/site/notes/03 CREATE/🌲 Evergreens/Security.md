## **Digging Deeper**
Security involves implementing measures such as encryption, firewalls, and authentication protocols to safeguard information. It encompasses aspects like confidentiality (keeping data private), integrity (ensuring data is accurate and unaltered), and availability (making sure data is accessible when needed). Threats to security can come from various sources such as hackers, malware, or even human error.

Security refers to the protection of digital systems, networks, and data from unauthorized access, damage, or theft. While privacy is about control over information sharing, security is about safeguarding that information from threats. Security measures create barriers that prevent malicious actors from accessing, altering, or stealing sensitive data.

For beginners, security can be understood as:
- The locks, alarms, and protective measures for your digital life
- The tools and practices that keep your information safe from hackers and other threats
- The systems that ensure only authorized people can access your accounts and data
- The measures that maintain the integrity and availability of your digital information

## **Applications**  
- Online banking: Security measures protect your financial information when you access your bank account online.
- E-commerce transactions: Security protocols ensure that your credit card details are safe when making purchases online.
- Healthcare records: Security in healthcare systems keeps patient information confidential and secure from unauthorized access.
- Government networks: Security is crucial in protecting sensitive government data from cyber threats.
- Smart home devices: Security features in smart home gadgets prevent unauthorized access to control your home remotely.
