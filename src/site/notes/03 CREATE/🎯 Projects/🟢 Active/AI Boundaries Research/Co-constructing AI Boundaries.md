# Co-constructing AI Boundaries

## A Participatory Investigation

## Project Overview

This research employs a qualitative case study approach to investigate the emerging relationship between **pre-service literacy educators** and generative AI tools (NotebookLM) during authentic, semester-long inquiry tasks (Literacy Ethnography).

### Research Questions

- **RQ1.** How do pre-service literacy educators position generative AI within their workflow, as a cognitive partner, a structural authority, or something in between?
- **RQ2.** How do they negotiate boundaries using restriction, correction, refusal, or delegation?
- **RQ3.** What ethical tensions or uncertainties emerge in their reflections?

## 🧭 Theoretical & Methodological Core

The analysis is grounded in two interconnected frameworks:

1. **Theoretical Lens:** **Nexus Analysis** (Scollon & Scollon, 2004) views the student-AI interaction as a **Nexus of Practice**, situated at the intersection of **Historical Body**, **Interaction Order**, and **Discourses in Place**. This allows us to code AI not just as a tool, but as a **mediational means** influencing social action. [[Nexus Analysis Theory\|Nexus Analysis Theory]]
    
2. **Operational Lens:** The **5-Part Coding Schema** (adapted from Mollick & Mollick, 2023) is used for micro-interactional analysis, tracing the process from **Inputs** to **Reflection**.
    

## 🔬 Data and Key Findings (Coding Hub)

The research utilizes **Maximum Variation Sampling** across two primary case studies to analyze the full spectrum of boundary negotiation.
