# Homelab Journey Overview
*A blog series documenting the process of building and refining my personal homelab — and the reflective “director’s cut” exploring how AI helped me build, document, and make meaning from it.*

---

## 🎯 Series Purpose

This project began as an effort to understand digital infrastructure from the ground up — learning not just *how* to run servers and services, but *why* doing so matters for autonomy, agency, and literacy.  

Over time, the series evolved into two intertwined threads:

1. **Homelab Journey** — the *technical narrative*, tracing the step-by-step build from conception to automation.  
2. **Director’s Cut: Building With AI** — the *meta-level reflection*, documenting how generative AI shaped the process of learning, building, and writing.

Together, they form a long-term inquiry into what it means to take ownership of your digital environment while collaborating with AI as a thought partner.

## 🗂️ Series Structure

### 🌐 **Homelab Journey (Main Series)**  
A chronological narrative of the technical build and its evolving philosophy.

   → *Prompts:* What backup approaches actually worked in practice?  

6. [[03 CREATE/📝 Blog/Homelab Journey, Part 6 Services & Containers\|Homelab Journey, Part 6 Services & Containers]]
   What runs on the homelab: media servers, automation, and web services.  
   → *Prompts:* Which services proved foundational? How do I balance convenience and control?  

7. [[03 CREATE/📝 Blog/Homelab Journey, Part 7 Advanced Configurations\|Homelab Journey, Part 7 Advanced Configurations]]
   Experiments in GPU passthrough, automation, and AI integration.

   Keeping systems observable and healthy.  
   → *Prompts:* How do I track uptime and performance sustainably?  

9. [[03 CREATE/📝 Blog/Homelab Journey, Part 9 Security, Access & Ethics\|Homelab Journey, Part 9 Security, Access & Ethics]] 
   Protecting data and considering the ethics of self-hosting.  
   → *Prompts:* How do I manage access, updates, and transparency ethically?  

10. [[03 CREATE/📝 Blog/Homelab Journey, Part 10 Reflection & Next Steps\|Homelab Journey, Part 10 Reflection & Next Steps]]
    Synthesizing what I learned technically and personally.  
    → *Prompts:* How has this changed how I understand systems, autonomy, and learning?

---

### 🎬 **Director’s Cut: Building With AI (Meta Series)**  
A reflective “making-of” thread about working *with* AI to build and document the homelab.  
This series serves as a running commentary on collaboration, cognition, and creativity with generative models — and how tools like ChatGPT, Claude, and Obsidian co-shaped the process.

1. [[03 CREATE/📝 Blog/How I Wrote This With AI\|How I Wrote This With AI]]
   Behind the scenes of how AI tools shaped this series — process, partnership, and messiness.  

2. [[03 CREATE/📝 Blog/When the AI Forgets\|When the AI Forgets]] 
   Learning to troubleshoot not just servers, but an imperfect thought partner.  

3. [[03 CREATE/📝 Blog/Using AI as a Research Partner\|Using AI as a Research Partner]]
   Treating generative models as collaborators in research, reflection, and creative inquiry.  

4. [[03 CREATE/📝 Blog/What I Learned Building (and Writing) With AI\|What I Learned Building (and Writing) With AI]]
   The synthesis post: integrating technical, cognitive, and ethical insights from this journey.

## 🧰 Writing & Publishing Workflow

This project lives across several interconnected tools — each contributing a layer of reflection and revision.

| Stage | Tool | Role |
|-------|------|------|
| Idea generation | **ChatGPT** | Brainstorming, outlining, and scaffolding reflection prompts |
| Note organization | **Obsidian + Claude MCP** | Structuring, tagging, and crosslinking notes; long-term memory and synthesis |
| Drafting & revision | **ChatGPT** | Fact-checking, refining writing, and clarifying ideas |
| Editing & voice tuning | **WordPress + Grammarly** | Final polish, readability, and accessibility |
| Publication | **Digital Garden → Blog** | Publishing “rough cuts” in progress and polished final versions |

This workflow allows the series to evolve transparently: each post begins as a note in Obsidian, grows through AI collaboration, and moves through revision stages before public release.
