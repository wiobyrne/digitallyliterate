# Progressive Community Agreements

This is the more research focused version of the work.on Frameworks for Accountable, Healing-Centered Spaces.

---

Progressive organizations across the anti-racist, feminist, cooperative, and transformative justice movements have developed sophisticated community agreements that **prioritize collective responsibility, healing, and transformation over individual punishment**. These frameworks represent a fundamental shift from traditional organizational models, emphasizing shared power, restorative accountability, and community care while maintaining rigorous standards for safety and justice.

The research reveals that these organizations have moved beyond simple "safe space" concepts to create **"accountable spaces"** that center marginalized voices, address systemic oppression, and build community resilience through mutual aid and transformative practices.

## The evolution from safe spaces to accountable communities

Progressive organizations have fundamentally reimagined how communities create safety and handle conflict. The **Black Lives Matter movement** exemplifies this evolution, with BLM-LA articulating principles of "restorative justice and struggle" that intentionally build "beloved community that is bonded together through a beautiful struggle that is restorative, not depleting."

**AWARE-LA's "Brave Space" framework** demonstrates this shift in practice. Their ten communication guidelines evolved from recognizing that white people were claiming spaces weren't "safe" when challenged on racism. Brave spaces acknowledge "the likelihood that we will be uncomfortable when investigating issues of race, privilege, and oppression" while maintaining clear boundaries for respectful engagement.

Some organizations have moved even further toward **"accountable spaces"** that center impact over intent and require allies to take responsibility for creating inclusive conditions. This framework recognizes that marginalized people must be brave daily to survive, shifting focus from individual comfort to collective responsibility for addressing harm.

The **Feminist Autonomous Centre** exemplifies this approach with their "code of contact" rather than "code of conduct," emphasizing "collective responsibilities for generating productive, anti-oppressive, empowering conditions for contact." Their framework treats conflict as growth: "Discomforts, tensions, disagreements and conflicts come with all relationalities; we believe these are an opportunity to deepen relationships."

## Transformative justice principles reshape accountability

**Transformative justice has emerged as the dominant framework** for addressing harm in progressive communities, offering concrete alternatives to punitive approaches. Transform Harm, created by organizer Mariame Kaba, defines transformative justice as "a political framework and approach for responding to violence, harm and abuse" that "seeks to respond to violence without creating more violence."

The **Bay Area Transformative Justice Collective** developed the influential "Pod System" - support networks that include general pods for everyday support, survivor pods for those who've experienced harm, accountability pods for those who've caused harm, and bystander pods for witnesses. This system emphasizes **quality over quantity in relationships** and explicit consent for participation.

**Generation FIVE's approach to child sexual abuse** demonstrates how transformative justice handles serious harm. Their framework focuses on "safety, healing, and agency for survivors" while maintaining that "people who offend are created, not born" and behavior can be transformed. Accountability becomes "a practice, not a destination" that integrates analysis of systemic oppression.

These organizations consistently use **"calling in" rather than "calling out"** language, emphasizing relationship-building over public shaming. As the research shows, "relationship and trust, not always political analysis, continue to be two of the most important factors in successful TJ interventions."

## Cooperative governance structures center shared power

**Cooperation Jackson** demonstrates how progressive organizations structure democratic decision-making around cooperative principles. Their framework includes "democratic member control" with one member, one vote; "sovereignty of labor" that renounces wage labor; and "pay solidarity" limiting pay differentials to a factor of six. Their governance emphasizes that "democratic control means participation in management and the ongoing development of the skills needed for self-management."

**Community Land Trusts** exemplify shared ownership models through "tripartite boards" with equal representation of residents, community members, and public interest. This structure ensures "democratic control" where "community members and the governance board make decisions based on what is best for their own community" while maintaining permanent affordability through collective ownership.

The **National Domestic Workers Alliance** structures organizing around "shared decision-making" where members "share ideas and listen respectfully to others" while maintaining "collective action" through coordinated strategy. Their approach emphasizes "breaking isolation" and "shared leadership" rather than hierarchical authority.

**Feminist cooperatives** consistently reject traditional management structures in favor of horizontal organizing. The Association for Women's Rights in Development (AWID) emphasizes "collective responsibility" where members "assume collective responsibility to ensure an atmosphere of mutual respect" and practice "active listening" with awareness of "how much time and space you are taking up."

## Community care and mutual aid principles

**adrienne maree brown's emergent strategy** has profoundly influenced progressive community agreements, with her principles actively used by organizations nationwide. Key agreements include "move at the speed of trust," "focus on critical connections more than critical mass," and "never a failure, always a lesson."

**Allied Media Projects** has developed comprehensive frameworks that "cultivate care and joy" while working to "dismantle harmful systems." Their community agreements emphasize asking questions before assuming, defaulting to direct communication before public call-outs, and sharing learning broadly.

**Mutual aid networks** consistently organize around "solidarity not charity" with horizontal relationships where everyone both gives and receives support. Mutual Aid NYC's principles include "long-term solidarity with the community, not momentary acts of charity" and transparent, collaborative decision-making that amplifies community needs.

The **Movement Strategy Center** operates on "radical interdependence" that recognizes "essential connections between communities and nations" with a "love-centered approach" that embodies partner values. Their "just transition" framework shifts from extractive to regenerative economic relationships.

## Privacy and security frameworks protect marginalized communities

Progressive organizations have developed sophisticated approaches to protecting marginalized members, recognizing that "populations that experience the brunt of systematic racism, inequality, and bias also become targets of invasive and unwarranted surveillance."

**Digital security measures** include secure communication tools, VPN usage, and protected website infrastructure. Organizations like MediaJustice call for "digital security tools by and for communities of color" that address economic barriers to stronger security.

**Community protection strategies** emphasize "share the message, not the messenger" approaches, protection of individual identities in learning spaces, and trauma-informed handling of sensitive information. Many organizations explicitly state they "will never share information with law enforcement."

**For LGBTQ+ communities**, specific frameworks include using encrypted communication, avoiding geo-tagging sensitive locations, and connecting with platforms designed with LGBTQ+ safety in mind. The Progressive Safety Alliance offers comprehensive security culture development and anti-doxxing guides.

## Specific language patterns and frameworks

**Collective responsibility language** consistently appears across organizations: "We assume collective responsibility," "collective care," "shared leadership," and "community accountability." This represents a fundamental shift from individual blame to systemic analysis.

**Transformative justice language** includes "restorative rather than punitive," "calling in rather than calling out," "conflict as opportunity for growth," and "healing, accountability, resilience, and safety for all." Organizations consistently reject "overdetermined binaries of innocence/guilt" in favor of transformation.

**Shared power language** emphasizes "democratic self-management," "horizontal organizing," "community control," and "one member, one vote." These terms reflect concrete governance structures rather than abstract ideals.

**Community care language** includes "interdependence and collective care," "radical compassion," "community belonging," and "assume collective responsibility." This vocabulary creates cultures of mutual support and shared vulnerability.

## Implementation strategies and practical tools

**The Pod Mapping system** from BATJC provides practical worksheets for building support networks before crisis occurs. Tools include original pod maps, skills and needs assessments, and shared pod mapping for overlapping networks.

**Community accountability toolkits** offer step-by-step processes. Creative Interventions developed comprehensive community-based responses to violence, while Generation FIVE created guides for "Toward Transformative Justice" that integrate individual and community transformation.

**Conflict resolution processes** emphasize skilled facilitation, community restoration involving entire organizations, and repair processes that may include apologies, paid leave, or structural changes. The Feminist Autonomous Centre's "complaint-positive" approach refuses the logic that "you name the problem, you become the problem."

**Democratic decision-making tools** include consensus processes, rotating leadership roles, and transparent procedures for addressing violations. Many organizations use "consent-based data collection" and "privacy-by-default" approaches that protect member information.

## Conclusion: Building liberation through community agreements

These progressive organizations demonstrate that **community agreements can be powerful tools for social transformation** when they move beyond rule-based systems to relationship-centered approaches that prioritize healing, shared power, and collective responsibility. Their frameworks offer concrete alternatives to punitive, hierarchical models while maintaining rigorous standards for safety and accountability.

The consistency across anti-racist, feminist, cooperative, and transformative justice organizations suggests these approaches represent **a coherent alternative paradigm** for community building. By centering marginalized voices, addressing systemic oppression, and building mutual aid systems, these frameworks create conditions for both individual healing and collective liberation.

Most significantly, these organizations prove that **communities can address serious harm and conflict through love-centered, transformative approaches** that honor everyone's humanity while maintaining safety and accountability. Their work provides practical templates for any community seeking to build more equitable, healing-centered spaces that challenge oppression while nurturing human flourishing.
