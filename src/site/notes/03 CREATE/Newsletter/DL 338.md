### 1. **[Living in the Past: A Digital Reality](https://theconvivialsociety.substack.com/p/we-are-not-living-in-a-simulation)**  
L. M. Sacasas unpacks how the internet is a repository of our past rather than a space for present action or future creation.  
- On the internet, actions are inscriptions, feeding archives rather than enabling progress.  
- Fighting over the past has replaced imagining the future.
