## Change Blindness

Welcome to _Digitally Literate_, issue #376. This week, I explored the impact of algorithms, the evolving role of AI, and how unconscious processes shape our decisions.

---

## 🔖 Key Takeaways
- **Unchecked Algorithms**: Algorithms often automate inequality and bias, demanding transparency and accountability.
- **AI’s Power Dynamics**: The latest technological wave may radically redistribute power, with AI playing a central role.
- **Change Blindness**: Our perception is more detailed than previously believed, but attentional gaps remain.

## 📚 Readings & Insights

### 1. **The Dangers of Unchecked Algorithms**
Cathy O’Neil’s _Weapons of Math Destruction_ exposes how algorithms can perpetuate inequality and prejudice in decisions like credit scoring and prison sentencing. O’Neil calls for greater accountability and transparency in their use. [Explore more](https://wiobyrne.com/weapons-of-math-destruction/).

**Why this matters:** Mathematical models profoundly impact our lives, often without oversight, reinforcing structural inequalities.

---

### 2. **The Intelligence Explosion**
Nick Bostrom predicts the creation of general intelligence smarter than humans within this century. While this breakthrough could redefine humanity, it carries immense responsibility. 

**Why this matters:** As we develop AI, we must address ethical concerns and human cruelty to prevent catastrophic outcomes. [Learn more](https://futureoflife.org/ai/).

---

### 3. **OpenAI’s New Core Values**
OpenAI has updated its values, prioritizing AGI (artificial general intelligence) development above its previous principles. [Read more](https://www.wired.com/story/openai-core-values-change/).

**Why this matters:** Shifting values raise questions about transparency, ethics, and whether corporations genuinely uphold their stated principles.

---

### 4. **Perception and Change Blindness**
New research challenges assumptions about how much detail we perceive in our surroundings. Familiarity enhances our ability to notice changes, even when distracted or interrupted. [Dive deeper](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3001423).

**Why this matters:** Phenomena like change blindness and inattentional blindness show the limitations of human awareness and how focus affects perception.

---

### 5. **The Whole Earth Catalog Goes Online**
The _Whole Earth Catalog_, a seminal publication blending ecological awareness and technological progress, is now freely accessible online. This archive offers a nostalgic yet relevant lens for exploring sustainable futures. [Access the catalog](https://archive.org/details/wholeearthcatalog).

**Why this matters:** Revisiting the catalog’s blend of ecology and innovation offers inspiration for tackling today’s interconnected challenges.

## 🛠️ DO: Enhance Decision-Making

### Think, Blink, or Sleep-on-it?
A longform piece reveals that distraction often leads to better decisions than conscious thought or snap judgments, particularly when evidence is limited. [Explore the science](https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2006-14216-004.html).

**Key insight:** Our unconscious mind can process and integrate information effectively, often outperforming deliberate thinking in complex scenarios.
