# DL 325

Welcome back all. Here is Digitally Literate, issue #325.

My publication of this newsletter has been inconsistent over the last month. I have been traveling a lot in between classes as my father quickly fought, and ultimately lost a battle against lung cancer. I will travel again next week as we're holding a celebration of his life near where I grew up.

My father was a regular reader of this newsletter and my writing. Not long after I would post an issue, he would call me up to talk through how great the entire issue was, or a specific post that I wrote. I often highlight when readers reach out to me to say thanks. I would be remiss if I didn't say thank you to one of my longest, most ardent supporters. (▰˘︹˘▰)

### 📺 Watch  

#### ["Let This Darkness Be a Bell Tower"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9waa9Q-RZxQ)

“Let This Darkness Be a Bell Tower” by [Rainer Maria Rilke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainer_Maria_Rilke).

We know poetry to be a critical pillar of public life. It rises up when official language fails us. And it gives voice to what is human and what is true, how we connect and what questions we hold.

### 📖 Read  

#### [The Life Cycle of Outrage](https://markmanson.net/the-life-cycle-of-outrage)

[Mark Manson](https://markmanson.net) breaks down how outrage spreads and dissipates in the age of social media. He identifies three waves:

1. **Wave One - The Primary Viral Wave**: Within 72 hours, the initial event generates hot takes, critiques, and misinformation.
2. **Wave Two - The Reactionary Viral Wave**: Tribalism emerges as camps form and combat one another's narratives.
3. **Wave Three - Anti-Reactionary Viral Wave**: Cooler heads prevail, often calling for unity or educating on the event’s complexities.

This cycle often distracts us from long-term progress as we’re swept from one outrage to the next.

#### [The “Online Brain”](https://embedded.substack.com/p/you-dont-need-to-post-through-a-crisis?s=r)

Researchers suggest the internet acts as a "supernormal stimulus," making traditional methods of memory and cognition redundant. While this reliance may free up mental space, it also risks blurring the lines between our minds and devices.

The long-term effects on our cognition remain uncertain, but this shift is changing how we interact with the world and store knowledge.

#### [Humane Tech: It's Not Too Late](https://singularityhub.com/2022-03-14/its-not-too-late-to-replace-toxic-tech-with-humane-technology/)

As tech advances rapidly, our ability to adapt and regulate lags behind. This piece outlines the steps we can take to promote humane tech, starting with raising awareness and fostering healthier habits.

How can we reshape our digital spaces to prioritize human well-being over engagement metrics?

#### [Teaching is Becoming What You Hate](https://dynomight.net/teaching/)

This reflective post critiques traditional grading and its impact on student learning. It aligns with discussions about ungrading, where final exams could represent 100% of a grade but allow multiple attempts.

It challenges us to rethink assessment practices to foster growth rather than conformity.

#### [The New Silent Majority](https://www.axios.com/political-polarization-twitter-cable-news-ac9699c6-260d-4141-b511-5c7193566ea1.html)

Despite the noise on social media, research suggests most people are moderate, friendly, and disengaged from online conflict. The trend suggests that everything is not as bad as we think it is. Put a different way, if you look on social media, life appears to be a giant [hellscape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellscape). But, different threads seem to suggest that it's a small number of vocal, bad actors that are creating a bunch of noise and influencing others.

This "silent majority" could provide a counterbalance to polarization, but how can their voices be amplified in meaningful ways?

### 💡 Do  

#### [The Seven Emojis of Grief](https://www.newyorker.com/humor/daily-shouts/the-seven-emojis-of-grief)

1. 😱
2. 🙃
3. 😬
4. 😤
5. 😑
6. 😐
7. 💅

It’s okay to move between these emojis as you process your emotions.
