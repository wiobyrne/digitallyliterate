#### [The Metaverse Is Already Here — It’s Minecraft](https://debugger.medium.com/the-metaverse-is-already-here-its-minecraft-99c89ed8ba2)  
As Facebook rebrands to Meta, and [Zuckerberg trots out a vision of the metaverse](https://www.vice.com/en/article/88g9vv/zuckerbergs-meta-endgame-is-monetizing-all-human-behavior), [Clive Thompson](https://www.clivethompson.net/) indicates that our kids are already building and playing in the metaverse.

_The truth is, a thriving metaverse already exists. It’s incredibly high-functioning, with millions of people immersed in it for hours a day. In this metaverse, people have built uncountable custom worlds, and generated god knows how many profitable businesses and six-figure careers. Yet this terrain looks absolutely nothing the like one Zuckerberg showed off._

_It’s Minecraft, of course._

#### [A Horrifying New AI App Swaps Women Into Porn Videos With a Click](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021-09-13/1035449/ai-deepfake-app-face-swaps-women-into-porn/)  
We knew this day would come.

We've covered deepfakes for some time here in this newsletter. Deepfakes began as users could take the face and voice of someone famous and overlay that onto a pre-existing video. Most of the early deepfakes began as AI-generated synthetic media was used to create pornographic representations of real people.

According to deepfake researcher [Henry Adjer](https://twitter.com/henryajder), a new web app lets anyone upload a photo of a person and, using deepfake technology, superimpose their face into an adult video.

So far, the app exists in “relative obscurity,” and the MIT Tech Review post above refers to the platform only as “Y,” in an attempt to avoid inadvertently launching it into the mainstream.
