## A Web Renaissance  

Welcome to _Digitally Literate_, issue #328.  

The semester is officially a wrap! Between hosting a poetry slam for my students and preparing for AERA, this week has been all about celebrating creativity and connection. Here’s what I’ve been up to:  

- [_Towards a New Normal: Motivation & engagement in digital spaces_](https://wiobyrne.com/towards-a-new-normal/) – Presented a virtual workshop at AERA 2022.  
- [_Building a Virtual Community of Practice: Teacher Learning for Computational Thinking Infusion_](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11528-022-00729-6) – Published in print, sharing lessons learned from keeping Computational Thinking PD thriving despite COVID interruptions.  
- [_Like Painters, Writers Can Stir the Mind_](https://literacy6-12.org/like-painters-writers-can-stir-the-mind/) – Angela Cozart reflects on the transformative power of poetry.

## 📚 Highlights  

### 1. **[The Joy of Being Wrong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRXNUx4cua0)**  
Internet arguments often devolve into toxicity, but practicing intellectual humility can transform how we engage. Science shows humility helps us build better arguments, reduces stress, and even boosts happiness.  

Could this mindset shift lead to a healthier, more productive internet culture?

### 2. **[Back to the Future of Twitter](https://stratechery.com/2022/back-to-the-future-of-twitter/?ref=refind)**  
Elon Musk’s proposed acquisition of Twitter has sparked debates about free speech and the platform’s future. Ben Thompson suggests splitting Twitter into two entities: one focusing on the core service and the other on advertising.  

Twitter’s role as the “phone service of the web” makes its structure and governance critical for the broader internet ecosystem.

### 3. **[A Web Renaissance](https://anildash.com/2022-04-13/a-web-renaissance/)**  
Anil Dash celebrates the revival of creativity on the web. Mistrust in big tech has pushed developers and users toward independent, creative digital spaces.  

**What excites me:** Ordinary people are crafting weird and wonderful online experiences again. Let’s nurture this spirit!

### 4. **[Information as the Fifth State of Matter](https://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/a39588076/information-could-be-the-fifth-state-of-matter/)**  
Physicist Melvin Vopson posits that information could be a measurable state of matter, alongside solid, liquid, gas, and plasma. This theory could have profound implications for data storage and even our understanding of dark matter.  

In [his 2019 _AIP Advances_ paper](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5123794), Physicist [​​Melvin Vopson](https://www.port.ac.uk/about-us/structure-and-governance/our-people/our-staff/melvin-vopson), suggests there is a _mass-energy-information equivalence principle_. This principle suggests that a digital information bit—used for digital data storage today—is not just physical, but has a “finite and quantifiable mass while it stores information.” This very small mass is 3.19 × 10\-38 kilograms at room temperature.

This would identify information as the fifth state of matter alongside gas, plasma, liquid, and solid states. A scientist has proposed an experiment involving particle annihilation that could establish that information truly has mass. If successful, the experiment could shed light on the mysterious dark matter in our universe—and help us manage the future of data storage.

**Mind blown:** Digital data might have mass!

### 5. **[The Miracle Year Pattern](https://www.dwarkeshpatel.com/p/annus-mirabilis?s=r)**  
Many great scientists experience an “annus mirabilis” or miracle year, marked by rapid breakthroughs. Factors include youth, focus, and openness to fresh perspectives.  

**Reflection:** What could we achieve if we cultivated these conditions in our own lives?

### 6. **[How to get your kid to do stuff without having to constantly remind them](https://www.vox.com/23001568/how-to-effectively-remind-your-kids-to-do-things)**

If you feel like you're constantly nagging others to help out, here are some expert-recommended strategies to get to a better place.

- _Make the invisible visible._ Explain the what, why, and how things get done.
- _Treat nagging as a sign that something isn’t working._ Badgering and harassing is the last resort of someone without options.
- _Start with problem-solving_. Identify the situation and problem you're trying to solve, and calmly discuss potential solutions.
- _When necessary, remind playfully._ Think about your tone as you direct others.
- _Don't just tell, teach._ Don't assume others are set up for success.
- _Expect to revisit things._ We're all human.


## 🛠️ DO: [Develop a Longevity Mindset](https://www.fastcompany.com/90741008/anti-aging-technology-is-coming-heres-how-you-can-be-ready-for-it)

Billionaires like Jeff Bezos see aging as a disease to be cured. Here’s how you can prepare for a vibrant future:  

1. **Beliefs**: Shift your mindset to see aging as a challenge, not an inevitability.  
2. **Media Diet**: Choose books, films, and articles that inspire growth and optimism.  
3. **Community**: Surround yourself with energetic, forward-thinking people.  
4. **Sleep & Diet**: Prioritize restorative sleep and nutritious foods.  
5. **Exercise**: Build muscle and stay active.  
6. **Mindset**: Visualize a bigger, brighter future.
