## Privacy Is Relative

Welcome to _Digitally Literate_, issue #363. This week, I shared the following:

- _[4 ways that AI can help students](https://theconversation.com/4-ways-that-ai-can-help-students-200973)_  
  My first post for *The Conversation*, exploring how AI could reshape education.  
- _[How Will AI Impact the Job of Educators?](https://wiobyrne.com/ai-impact-the-job-of-educators/)_  
  Discussing the accelerators and barriers that AI introduces to the role of educators.  
- _[Understanding Theory of Mind in AI: Implications and Limitations](https://wiobyrne.com/understanding-theory-of-mind-in-ai-implications-and-limitations/)_  
  Exploring cognitive aspects of AI and its implications for human-like learning.
