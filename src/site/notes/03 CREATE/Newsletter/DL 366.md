## 📚 This Week’s Highlights

### 1. **Apple Vision Pro**
Apple announced the Vision Pro at its Developer’s Conference. Touted as a leap forward in spatial computing, the device avoids terms like VR, AR, or XR. While many balk at the hefty price tag, its potential for redefining human-computer interaction remains intriguing.

### 2. **2022 Expert Survey on AI Progress**
A survey conducted before the AI boom predicted a 50% chance of achieving high-level machine intelligence (HLMI) by 2059. Respondents emphasized the need for increased AI safety research and underscored the importance of focusing on feasibility, not just adoption.

### 3. **Lost in Translation**
Multilingual language models promise increased access across languages but face issues like poor training data and contextual errors. While they hold potential for content moderation, these models are far from perfect.

### 5. **Instagram’s Troubling Role**
A Wall Street Journal investigation revealed that Instagram’s recommendation system connects a network of accounts promoting underage content. While Meta promises improvements, its algorithms raise serious concerns about safety.

**Why this matters:** Companies must prioritize user safety over growth at all costs.

---

### 6. **Spatial Computing**
First coined by Simon Greenwold in 2003, spatial computing refers to human-computer interaction that integrates real-world spaces and objects. Apple’s avoidance of VR/AR terminology suggests a broader ambition for the Vision Pro.
