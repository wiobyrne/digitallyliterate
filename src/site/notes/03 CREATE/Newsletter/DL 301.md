### 2. **[School Culture Wars: ‘You Have Brought Division to Us’](https://www.nytimes.com/2021-08-18/us/schools-covid-critical-race-theory-masks-gender.html)**  
From mask mandates to critical race theory and gender identity, educators are besieged. “You are just trying to keep everything from collapsing,” one official said.  
  
Schools were already facing a crisis of historic proportions. They are reopening just as a highly contagious Delta variant of the coronavirus is tearing through communities. They need to create a safe environment for teachers and students while helping children who have been through major trauma.  
  
But at this critical moment, many school officials find themselves engulfed in highly partisan battles, which often have distracted from the most urgent issues.

**Why this matters:** Educators are being asked to balance public health, student well-being, and deeply divided public opinion.

### 3. **[Parents Are Not Okay](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/08/parents-are-not-okay/619859/)**  
An honest exploration of how parents are coping—barely—amid the ongoing challenges of the pandemic. 

_Parents aren’t even at a breaking point anymore. We’re broken. And yet we’ll go on because that’s what we do: We sweep up all our pieces and put them back together as best we can. We carry on chipped and leaking and broken because we have no other choice. And we pray that if we can just keep going, our kids will survive too._

**Why this matters:** A reminder to offer grace and support to those juggling immense responsibilities.

### 4. **[What Robots Teach Us About Persuasion](https://www.fastcompany.com/90668496/a-new-study-reveals-what-we-can-learn-about-how-to-persuade-people-from-watching-robots)**  
Experiments with robot swarms reveal that sporadic social interactions spread new information better than one-size-fits-all approaches.  
**Why this matters:** A lesson for educators, leaders, and communicators on the power of tailored, personal interactions.  

---

### 5. **[9 Apps to Help Kids Sharpen Their Coding Skills](https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/education/learning-to-code/)**  
A roundup of platforms that make learning to code fun and accessible for kids.  
**Why this matters:** Coding is an essential skill for the future and a gateway to creativity and problem-solving.
