## Dwell Time  

Welcome to _Digitally Literate_, issue #332.  

This week, I presented three sessions at [TLT Con 2022](https://tlt.cofc.edu/tltcon/), focusing on privacy, online teaching, and leveraging edtech for social good. Let’s explore the week’s key insights and reflections.

## 🔖 Key Takeaways  

- **Attention and Creativity**: The internet’s algorithms are reshaping creativity, often limiting originality in favor of trends.  
- **Digital Privacy**: Our data is increasingly a tool of surveillance, and rebuilding privacy requires systemic changes.

## 📚 This Week’s Highlights  

### 1. **[The Problem with Internet Creativity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ieq6V3o4rqM)**  
Creativity online often succumbs to imitation driven by algorithms. People follow what works rather than forging unique paths.  
**Why this matters:** Reclaiming creativity means resisting algorithmic pressures and fostering authentic self-expression.

### 2. **[The Double Terror of Being Black in America](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/05/buffalo-shooting-manifesto-racism-great-replacement/629924/)**  
The role of platforms like 4chan in promoting violent ideologies, including the recent tragedy in Buffalo, highlights the need for accountability and systemic change.  
**Why this matters:** Addressing structural racism and online hate requires a multi-faceted approach, including education, policy, and platform regulation.

### 3. **[We Need to Take Back Our Privacy](https://www.nytimes.com/2022-05-19/opinion/privacy-technology-data.html)**  
Zeynep Tufekci argues that data collection is more than a convenience; it’s surveillance. Building a decentralized infrastructure is key to regaining control.  
**Why this matters:** Digital privacy is not a luxury—it’s a necessity for autonomy and freedom.

### 4. **[Dwell Time: The Magic 2.5 Seconds](https://www.eye-square.com/en/media-attention-benchmark/)**  
A meta-analysis found that users’ attention spans online average just 2.5 seconds—enough time to decide the value of content.  
**Why this matters:** This highlights the need for clear, engaging content and user-centered design in digital spaces.

### 5. **[Embracing Risk and Failure](https://bigthink.com/thinking/nietzsche-failure-comfort/)**  
Friedrich Nietzsche suggests that failure and discomfort are integral to a meaningful life. Over-reliance on technology for comfort can stifle growth.  
**Why this matters:** Evaluating our relationship with technology helps us embrace challenges and build resilience.

Transparency and openness foster trust and collaboration, which are essential for resilient and innovative systems.
