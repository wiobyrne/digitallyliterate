## More Human Than Human

Welcome to _Digitally Literate_, issue #373. This week, I explored impactful topics at the intersection of technology, society, and the human experience.

---

## 🔖 Key Takeaways

- **Debate & Substance**: The internet's clout-driven culture reduces meaningful discussions to performances.
- **Workplace Surveillance**: Invasive monitoring technologies redefine the relationship between employer and employee.
- **Charisma & AI**: Can AI dissect and replicate the essence of human charisma?
- **Memory & Learning**: The brain’s systems for sorting memories may hold insights for AI and human adaptability.

## 📚 This Week’s Highlights

### 1. **JuMBOs: A New Astronomical Discovery**
In high-resolution imagery of the Orion Nebula, scientists discovered Jupiter Mass Binary Objects (JuMBOs)—a smaller class of gaseous objects. While brown dwarfs grow to about 13 times the mass of Jupiter, JuMBOs are as small as half Jupiter's mass and orbit each other at an incredible distance.

📺 [Watch the discovery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYOnoXWSfnI)

**Why this matters:** This discovery challenges our understanding of planetary formation and star systems. [Learn more](https://www.nytimes.com/2023-10-02/science/orion-nebula-webb-planets.html).

### 2. **Workplace Surveillance & Little Tech**
Workplace surveillance, exacerbated by the rise of remote work, increasingly relies on invasive technologies like employee monitoring software. Researchers [Wilneida Negrón](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wilneidanegron/) and [Aiha Nguyen](https://datasociety.net/people/nguyen-aiha/) highlight the risks to privacy and collective organizing rights.

**Why this matters:** Technological creep threatens to transform workplace management into a tool of servitude. [Explore the implications](https://home.coworker.org/worktech/).

---

### 3. **Charisma, Humanity & AI**
[Joe Zadeh](https://www.joezadeh.com/) explores [the history and nature of charisma](https://www.noemamag.com/the-secret-history-and-strange-future-of-charisma/), breaking it down into measurable components. Charisma, tied to values, symbolism, and emotion, can have positive or negative societal effects.

**Why this matters:** If AI can replicate charisma, what are the ethical and societal consequences?

---

### 4. **The Future of Memory**
A recent study published in *Nature Neuroscience* proposes that the brain organizes memories by their future utility. This theory updates the understanding of the hippocampus and neocortex, which encode and integrate information for short- and long-term use.

📖 [Read the study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-023-01382-9)

**Why this matters:** Insights into memory organization could inform AI models designed for learning and adaptability.

---

### 5. **AI Regulation: Focus on Impacts**
The [National Conference of State Legislatures’ primer on AI regulation](https://www.ncsl.org/technology-and-communication/approaches-to-regulating-artificial-intelligence-a-primer) offers accessible insights into governance. It stresses the importance of balancing innovation with societal safeguards.

📖 [Explore the resource](https://www.ncsl.org/technology-and-communication/approaches-to-regulating-artificial-intelligence-a-primer)

**Why this matters:** Clear definitions and collective understanding are critical to adjusting for new and novel futures.

---

### 6. **Visualization & Ideation with AI**
Tools like [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) and [Ideogram](https://ideogram.ai/login) are transforming visual creativity, albeit imperfectly. While AI-generated text in images remains flawed, tools like these are evolving.
