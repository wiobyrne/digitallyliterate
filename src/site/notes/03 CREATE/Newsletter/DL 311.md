## Let's Keep It FRKE

Welcome back, everyone! Here’s _Digitally Literate_, issue #311.  

This week, I shared insights and reflections on creativity in education and technology. A highlight was working on _[Towards a Taxonomy of Transdisciplinarity](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IN65TBvZU_VltL5z50nlNh8BW-S5zAW4pWbTZ2FZBYQ/edit#heading=h.yrrd3q61b4bq)_, a paper for the LRA 2021 Conference. This project explored how pre-service teachers can use transdisciplinary thinking to connect math and music through summer art camps.

## 📺 Watch  

#### [All About Spoons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wJo5aKBwq0)

You’d be forgiven for wondering, as an adult, why Mister Rogers carries a spoon. As detailed in a new book, ([_When You Wonder, You’re Learning: Mister Rogers’ Enduring Lessons for Raising Creative, Curious, Caring Kid_s](http://whenyouwonder.org/)), the journey — from a simple Point A (a spoon) to a deeply human Point B — embodies the magic of _Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood_.

The effect is that for children, spoons become more than passing intrigues. They become musical instruments, a spark for artistic expression, and even possible career paths. Most importantly, they become points of connection between kids and caring adults. As science has shown, the more of these connections kids have, the better they tend to do.

**Why this matters**: Building connections through creativity can have a profound impact on children’s growth and curiosity.

## 💡 Do  

#### [Are You Problem Solving or Ruminating?](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/sweet-emotion/201409/are-you-problem-solving-or-ruminating)

As human beings, we have the capacity to reflect on our past behaviors. Unfortunately, there are many times in which going over the past becomes quite unproductive. The post above discusses how can we know if we are engaging in adaptive self-reflection or maladaptive rumination?

Rumination is sometimes viewed as [a negative form of emotional processing](https://www.verywellmind.com/repetitive-thoughts-emotional-processing-or-rumination-3144936).

_The defining aspect of rumination that differentiates it from regular problem-solving is the unproductively negative focus it takes. Rumination may involve going over the details of a situation in one’s head or talking to friends about it._

As a general rule, the following can be indicators that you may have fallen into the trap of rumination:

- Focusing on a problem for more than a few idle minutes
- Feeling worse than you started out feeling
- No movement toward accepting and moving on
- No closer to a viable solution
