## Lies Don't End Relationships...The Truth Does

Welcome to a new year. Here’s hoping it truly is a fresh start. Here is _Digitally Literate_, issue #316.

I posted the following this week:

- [_Becoming a Student Privacy Expert_](https://wiobyrne.com/student-privacy-expert/) - I completed the [Student Privacy Train-the-Trainer Program for K12](https://studentprivacycompass.org/ttt-k12-program-details/) from the [Future Privacy Forum](https://fpf.org/). I've shared content from the FPF and their [Student Privacy Compass](https://studentprivacycompass.org/) many times here in this newsletter. I'll share more informed guidance on privacy and security in my work.

## 🔖 Key Takeaways

## 📚 This Week’s Highlights

### 1. **[zoe (& rocco) fcking with the sanity of everyone on sesame street for 7 minutes and 45 seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-HQQKp8kFI)

[Elmo — yes, that Elmo — is beefing with a rock](https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/tv/story/2022-01-06/elmo-rocko-video-viral-twitter-sesame-street). And Twitter has been eating it up.

These Elmo clips on Twitter sum up most of the discussions I've had in 2022 so far. I feel like they perfectly encapsulate [gaslighting](https://www.verywellmind.com/is-someone-gaslighting-you-4147470).

### 2. **[Wordle Is a Love Story](https://www.nytimes.com/2022-01-03/technology/wordle-word-game-creator.html)**  
Josh Wardle created [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/) as a personal gift for his partner, which has since become a global phenomenon.  

This is not Mr. Wardle’s first brush with suddenly capturing widespread attention. Formerly a software engineer for Reddit, he created two collaborative social experiments on the site, called [The Button](https://www.vox.com/2015-04-10/8383165/reddit-button-explained) and [Place](https://reddit.fandom.com/wiki/Place), that were phenomena in their moment.

“It’s really sweet,” his partner said. “This is definitely how Josh shows his love.”
**Why this matters**: Simple acts of creativity can resonate far beyond their original intent.

### 3. **[8 Ways Teachers Are Talking About Jan. 6 in Their Classrooms](https://www.npr.org/2022-01-05/1070235674/teachers-capitol-riot-anniversary-lessons-students-schools)**  
A new [NPR/Ipsos poll](https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/seven-ten-americans-say-country-crisis-risk-failing) finds that 64% of Americans believe U.S. democracy is "in crisis and at risk of failing." The root of this rests in the [verifiably false](https://apnews.com/article/voter-fraud-election-2020-joe-biden-donald-trump-7fcb6f134e528fee8237c7601db3328f) claim that "voter fraud helped Joe Biden win the 2020 election" — a key pillar of the ["Big Lie"](https://www.npr.org/2021-12-23/1065277246/trump-big-lie-jan-6-election) that the election was stolen from former President Donald Trump. As political divides persist, [polls show Americans still don't agree on basic facts](https://www.npr.org/2022-01-03/1069764164/american-democracy-poll-jan-6) about why a mob overran the Capitol one year ago, attacked police, and threatened lawmakers.

It is an understatement to say that Teachers across the country faced a daunting challenge this week. How do they talk with students about the anniversary of the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.

[This report by the Digital Forensic Research Lab (DFRLab)](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/in-depth-research-reports/report/after-the-insurrection-how-domestic-extremists-adapted-and-evolved-after-the-january-6-us-capitol-attack/#findings) suggests that the threat posed by domestic extremists is even greater a year after the Capitol Attack.
**Why this matters**: Civic education is essential for critical thinking and engagement in democratic processes.

### 4. **[Want to Rule the Metaverse? Symbolism Is Key](https://www.fastcompany.com/90710128/want-to-rule-the-metaverse-symbolism-is-key)**  
_Symbolism is key. Symbols speak louder than words, because our brains decode meaning thousands of times faster from images than from text. But symbolism in the metaverse is different than symbolism in the physical realm._

As a literacy and technology researcher, this is nothing new to me. I've been teaching about [multimodal content](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimodality) and [semiotics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiotics) for longer than I can remember. I do wonder how the move to more virtual and augmented spaces will change things.

_What’s clear is that in this new ‘phygital’ space of the metaverse, the power of symbolism for brands knows no bounds. Those that can harness it to elevate what they stand for will be the ones who cut through and ultimately succeed in connecting with their target in new and exciting ways._

Phygital? Really? Knowing this work...we'll all be using phygital in the coming years. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ 
**Why this matters**: As the metaverse evolves, literacy in visual and multimodal communication will be paramount.

### 6. **[People Who Are Obsessed with Celebrities Tend to Score Lower on Measures of Cognitive Ability](https://www.psypost.org/2022/01/people-who-are-obsessed-with-celebrities-tend-to-score-lower-on-measures-of-cognitive-ability-62314)**  
Cognitive performance is slightly reduced among those with higher levels of celebrity worship, according to a new study published in [BMC Psychology](https://bmcpsychology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40359-021-00679-3).

Celebrity worship was measured using a scientific questionnaire known as the Celebrity Attitude Scale. The scale asks participants the extent to which they agree or disagree with statements such as “I often feel compelled to learn the personal habits of my favorite celebrity,” “I am obsessed by details of my favorite celebrity’s life,” and “If I were lucky enough to meet my favorite celebrity, and he/she asked me to do something illegal as a favor I would probably do it.”

Raises serious questions about [celebrity worship and addictive or problematic social media use](https://www.psypost.org/2020/04/new-study-links-celebrity-worship-to-addictive-and-problematic-social-media-use-56576). [Research](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-11769-001) [](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-11769-001)[published here](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-11769-001).
**Why this matters**: Encouraging critical engagement with media can counteract superficial distractions.

## 🛠️ DO: Creative Play and Music  

Check out [Threatening Music Notation](https://twitter.com/ThreatNotation) for absurd and entertaining interpretations of musical scores, including instructions to [consume cocaine](https://twitter.com/notation_wut/status/1478437362405449728), [moo like a cow](https://twitter.com/notation_wut/status/1478222455810543616), [slap a fish](https://twitter.com/notation_wut/status/1478409671350304770), and produce [fart-like sounds](https://twitter.com/notation_wut/status/1478115140943949828).

Before we chalk this up to foolishness, Twitter user [@ONEiROSEB](https://twitter.com/ONEiROSEB/status/1478416772420169728) says that playing the piano with your bottom may be taken from the works of Victor Borge, a Danish-American musical comedian.

## 🌟 Closing Reflection

> “You can lie to anyone in the world and even get away with it, perhaps, but when you are alone and look into your own eyes in the mirror, you can’t sidestep the truth. Always be sure you can meet those eyes directly. Otherwise, it’s big trouble, my girl.”  
> — **Betty White**
