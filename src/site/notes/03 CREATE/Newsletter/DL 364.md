## 📚 This Week’s Highlights

### 1. **Divergent Conversations 2023**
The 2023 Divergent Award Honorees interrogate the question: _Do we know what we really think we know about literacy in digital spaces?_

📺 [Watch the session](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DWcxDJkr8Q&t=3s)

**Why this matters:** Divergent thinkers push boundaries, reshaping our understanding of digital literacy.

### 2. **AI and Civil Rights**
The National Artificial Intelligence Advisory Committee (NAIAC) emphasizes the need for a human rights-based approach to AI governance in its first-year report. Similarly, the White House's [Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/ai-bill-of-rights/) proposes principles for protecting public rights in the age of AI.

**Why this matters:** Ensuring AI systems prioritize safety, equity, and accountability is critical for societal trust.

### 3. **Classifying Constructive Comments**
The Constructive Comments Corpus (C3) provides a dataset of 12,000 annotated news comments to improve online community discussions. Constructive comments are defined by relevance, specificity, clarity, supportiveness, and politeness.

**Why this matters:** Promoting meaningful, respectful conversations online fosters healthier discourse and democratic engagement.

### 4. **The Ethics of EVs**
Producing EVs requires six times the mineral input of conventional vehicles, with significant human and environmental costs. The five critical minerals—aluminum, nickel, cobalt, manganese, and lithium—are mined in a few countries, raising concerns about ethical and sustainable supply chains.

**Why this matters:** Reducing carbon emissions from transportation must balance environmental and human rights considerations.

---

### 5. **Web Scraping & Double Standards**
Big Tech grants privileged access to social media data for social listening companies while restricting independent researchers. This disparity limits access to valuable insights about societal well-being.

### 6. **Why Are Insects Drawn to Light?**
New research suggests insects try to keep their backs pointed toward light, aiding navigation during the day but causing disorientation at night. The findings highlight the ecological impact of light pollution.

📖 [Read the study](https://www.nytimes.com/2023-04-27/science/moths-to-a-flame-insects-light.html)

**Why this matters:** Understanding light pollution’s effects on ecosystems is essential for mitigating its impact on biodiversity.
