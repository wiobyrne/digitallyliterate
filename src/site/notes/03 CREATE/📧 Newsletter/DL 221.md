### [Duolingo for Talking to Children (2:19)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsEsgp3H7CU)

This great video from Saturday Night Live indicates that it is never too late to learn how to talk to children.

I'll definitely save this for future workshops and talks.

### [Results from the 2018 International Computer & Information Literacy Study](https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/icils/icils2018/theme1.asp?fbclid=IwAR0C0_DHGLQT8eCay79nwQ9vCr4Ky5wJmiHK_AqLNHKm0sdsJyruUSgm6pQ)

Relatively good news from results of the 2018 International Computer and Information Literacy Study (ICILS) which assesses 8th-grade students in two domains: computer & information literacy (CIL) & computational thinking (CT).

Results show U.S. 8th-grade students' average score in CIL higher than the ICILS 2018 average for the second year in a row. US female 8th-graders outperformed their male peers in CIL, but male 8th-grade students outperformed female students in CT.

U.S. 8th-grade students with 2 or more computers at home performed better in CIL & CT than U.S. peers with fewer computers. 72% of US 8th graders reported using Internet for research daily or at least once a week, & 65% reported teaching themselves how to find info online.

If you want to dig a bit deeper, check out the [technical notes](https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/icils/technotes.asp) for the 2018 ICILS, [additional information](https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/icils/), [the questionnaires](https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/icils/questionnaires.asp), [FAQs](https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/icils/faqs.asp) and the [full international report](https://nces.ed.gov/transfer.asp?location=www.iea.nl/studies/iea/icils/2018/results).

### [A teen's guide to privacy](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/lamvo/advice-teens-protect-privacy-school-online-social-media)

As part of the [Screentime Research Project](https://screentime.me/), I've been studying with [Katie Paciga](https://twitter.com/kpaciga), [Elizabeth Stevens](https://twitter.com/eystevens), and [Kristen Turner](https://twitter.com/teachkht) as we learn about how to live and learn in a digital age.

This post is a good resource detailing how to talk with adolescents about how to participate online.

This piece is from Buzzfeed and is part of their [series on schools and social media surveillance](https://www.buzzfeed.com/tag/Schools%20And%20Surveillance).

### [The Government Protects Our Food and Cars. Why Not Our Data?](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/02/sunday-review/data-protection-privacy.html)

[Natasha Singer](https://twitter.com/natashanyt) with a post in the NY Times talking about data rights and asking why we do not have specific protections. The United States is the only developed nation without a comprehensive consumer data protection law and an independent agency enforcing it.

> Why are Americans protected from hazardous laptops, fitness trackers and smartphones — but not when hazardous apps on our devices expose and exploit our personal information?

### [Leaked documents show Facebook leveraged user data to fight rivals and help friends](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/all/leaked-documents-show-facebook-leveraged-user-data-fight-rivals-help-n1076986)

Facebook says they're trying to protect user privacy, but what they're really doing is tapping user data — including info about friends, relationships & photos — as leverage over companies it partners with.

Your data & attention are their resource.

As we discuss each week in this newsletter…perhaps it is time to delete Facebook. What are your thoughts?

As a response to this growing cacophony of bad press, and possible government involvement, [Facebook put on a brand new face](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/facebook-rebrands-calls-government-led-breakup-continue-n1076086#:~:targetText=Facebook%20rebrands%20as%20calls%20for%20government-led%20breakup%20continue,it%20up%20into%20various%20pieces.).

### [I Got Access to My Secret Consumer Score. Now You Can Get Yours, Too.](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/04/business/secret-consumer-score-access.html)

We now live in world where all of our lives are boiled down to a set of data points, and computer algorithms make split second decisions about us. This could be a job application, loan request, or college admissions packet.

[Kashmir Hill](https://twitter.com/kashhill) did some digging on the data that is used to make these decisions. In this piece she shares some actionable guidance on finding your data.

The post contains a quote from Jason Tan, the chief executive of Sift, one of the companies that uses data to determine consumer trustworthiness.

> "We're not looking at the data. It's just machines and algorithms doing this work," said Mr. Tan. "But it's incredible what machines can do when they can look under every stone."

## 🔨 Do

### [Bacon pickle pizza](https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/recipes/a55777/pickle-pizza-recipe/)
