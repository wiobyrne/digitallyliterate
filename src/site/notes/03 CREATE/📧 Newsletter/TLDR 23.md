** Too Long; Didn't Read (TL;DR) newsletter #23

------------------------------------------------------------

In TL;DR I'm sharing things that happened during the week in literacy, technology, & education that I think you should know. Please feel free to share with others you believe would benefit.

This week I worked on the following:

* Screencaptures & Screencasts in Education, Assessment, and Research (http://wiobyrne.com/screencaptures-screencasts-education-assessment-research/) - This week I taught my students about screencaptures and screencasts for an upcoming assignment. As a result, I thoroughly revised my previous posts on the subject. I think screencaptures/screencasts are mandatory tools that educators have in their toolkit.

* Allow it to be YouRTube (http://wiobyrne.com/yourtube/) - This post is another revision from a prior post. It is a guide for educators that are considering including online, digital video in their classroom...and how to get started. YouTube is one of those tools that educators sometimes feel they should be afraid of...and not using. This is especially true if we consider recording and publishing online. My thinking is that we should all be recording, remixing, and publishing digital content. YouTube is just one venue to help make this happen.

* Moving Toward Transparency in Higher Education (http://wiobyrne.com/moving-toward-transparency-in-higher-education/) - This post is from a document I wrote up with my colleague Amanda Bozack (https://www.linkedin.com/in/amanda-bozack-0104a5a0) . We were responding to the decisions, initiatives, and changes that were happening in higher ed all around us. We kept thinking that we should write something to get people to start thinking/talking about possibilities for transparency in relationships and management. Ultimately we too late realized that these decisions would cause the dissolution of our jobs and programs. Nevertheless, I have been thinking more about transparency and will have more of my thoughts in upcoming posts.

** Veronica Belmont on being overtaken by a meme (http://boingboing.net/2015/11/24/veronica-belmont-on-being-over.html)

An insightful talk by ** Veronica Belmont (https://twitter.com/Veronica)

as she discusses the process by which her identity was overtaken by a ** meme (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme)

. She openly and honestly reflects on her own participation and activities online.

Matt Haughey ** explains that (http://a.wholelottanothing.org/2015/11/veronica-gif-so-lifelike.html)

it's a "great talk that really drives home the point that sometimes the Internet can be a crappy place, but on the bright side, the Internet does let people hear the rest of a story."

## 📚 Read

** Privacy/Security and Bullying (http://www.zythepsary.com/writing/privacysecurity-and-bullying/)

The incredible ** Laura Hilliger (https://twitter.com/epilepticrabbit)

has been unpacking her own thoughts and reflections about privacy/security over the last couple of blog posts. I love these posts for a number of reasons. First, I think Laura writes in an approachable manner that is concise while at times poetic. Second, her posts are honest, and I think they represent ways that we (perhaps) should think about privacy/security.

As an example, I'll share one of the lines from this last post:

My question is – why should I have to armor myself? This is not about saying “I have nothing to hide”, it’s about whether or not I need armor when I’m a single grain of sand.

I also recommend reading ** her earlier post on identifying your "line" (http://www.zythepsary.com/techie/privacy-wheres-your-line/)

when it comes to privacy.

** (http://techcrunch.com/2015/06/26/molson-and-google-built-a-beer-fridge-that-unlocks-via-voice-translation/?ncid=rss)

** The birth and death of privacy: 3,000 years of history told through images (https://medium.com/the-ferenstein-wire/the-birth-and-death-of-privacy-3-000-years-of-history-in-50-images-614c26059e#.hxrmqgwhi)

In this post, ** Greg Ferenstein (https://twitter.com/ferenstein)

details our framing and understanding of privacy over the last 150 years. I find pieces like this fascinating as they help us contextualize our recent attempts to create and advocate for privacy.

This is a long read. Sit down with your tablet and a cup of coffee. :)

This post was shared by Laura Hilliger in the latest issue of ** her newsletter (http://zythepsary.us11.list-manage1.com/subscribe?u=da6fdd71afbd94ce75c8ce2f5&id=502d3835ee)

.

** Free speech or safe spaces? (http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2015/11/campus_protests_need_dialogue_not_safe_spaces_and_offense.html)

On our college campuses there recently has been a lot of protest and calls for recognition of a number of issues. In this post, ** Dalitha Lithwick (https://twitter.com/dahlialithwick)

calls for initiatives that promote dialogue and empathy among individuals.

I'm sharing this post to promote our thinking about online and hybrid spaces that could be leveraged as safe spaces for dialogue and unpacking these issues. The challenge is that, as I've detailed in the first couple of elements I shared in this newsletter...online spaces can sometimes be used for good or evil. Wondering if there is a way technology can be used to help.

** Is bigger always better? The case for starting small with new learning ideas (http://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2015/11/28/452898967/is-bigger-always-better-the-case-for-starting-small-with-new-learning-ideas?utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=education)

This piece in ** nprEd (http://www.npr.org/sections/ed/)

shares an interview with Matt Candler and the ** 4.0 Schools initiative (http://4pt0.org/)

.

Although I am intrigued by the work and model from 4.0 Schools, I'm much more moved by the overall guidance of the post that suggests that it is perfectly appropriate and that you're being successful if you don't worry about scale and numbers all of the time.

While creating and sharing online, we sometimes are very aware of numbers of readers/viewers and wondering why we can't have thousands or millions more. Perhaps there is wisdom in focusing on small-scale approaches. As the post states, perhaps we should focus on communities, identify problems, come up with solutions, and test prototypes.

I will try to keep this advice in mind as I work on some new initiatives.

** Vlogging, teens, and literacy: Engaging youth (http://www.slj.com/2015/11/students/vlogging-teens-and-literacy-engaging-youth/)

** Antero Garcia (https://twitter.com/anterobot)

writing in the ** School Library Journal (http://www.slj.com/)

about the possibilities for vlogging. Vlogging is short for video blogs and is increasingly becoming the medium of choice for youth as they learn online.

Tools for vlogging include Snapchat, Vine, Instagram, and YouTube. Antero states:

Vlogging is a venue for youth consumption and production regularly identified as an important space for educators to consider within their practice. While vlogging is a multimodal form of communication, it might also be a return to an oral tradition. Alongside social networking platforms such as ** Vine (https://vine.co/)

and ** Snapchat (https://www.snapchat.com/)

, fleeting videos and their circulation are not the text-based modes of engagement we have been using in the classroom.

Oh yes!!!

I love the work/materials from the ** Raspberry Pi Foundation (https://www.raspberrypi.org/)

. I've owned and hacked up different projects with the previous Raspbery Pi iterations. This latest version is only five dollars and is a bit faster than the previous units.

Supposedly, they had an earlier plan to make a $60 version that would focus on better performance but ** scrapped it after talking with Google's Eric Schmidt. (http://www.geek.com/chips/60-raspberry-pi-scrapped-after-chat-with-googles-eric-schmidt-1640563/)

## 🔨 Do

This post by ** Kevin Hodgson (https://twitter.com/dogtrax)

details his use of ** Soundtrap (https://www.soundtrap.com/)

to collaborate and make music with online jam partners.

Over the past couple of years I've been experimenting with ** Soundcloud (https://soundcloud.com/stream)

and other podcasting mediums/tools to create and share audio only content online. I think tools like Soundtrap might provide opportunities for educators and students that want to investigate playing and colaborating with audio or music online.

## 🤔 Consider

I learned that a long walk and calm conversation are an incredible combination if you want to build a bridge.
