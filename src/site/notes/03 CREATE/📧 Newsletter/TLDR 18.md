** Too Long; Didn't Read (TL;DR) newsletter #18

------------------------------------------------------------

Brought to you by Ian O'Byrne (https://twitter.com/wiobyrne) . Read more at my blog (http://wiobyrne.com/) .

Thank you for subscribing to this newsletter. Please feel free to share with others you believe would benefit. In TL;DR I'm sharing things that happened during the week in literacy, technology, and education that I think you should know.

Thanks again for the support. :)

This week I worked on the following:

* T (https://medium.com/the-slackerati/closed-with-a-side-of-open-a1c2fd2d08ee) he #WalkMyWorld Project: Video overview for the K12 online conference (http://wiobyrne.com/walkmyworld-k12online2015/)  - This week the video I produced on the #WalkMyWorld Project for the K12 Online Conference (http://k12onlineconference.org/) was finally released (http://k12onlineconference.org/2015/10/20/the-walkmyworld-project-exploring-the-use-of-digital-texts-and-tools-as-a-means-to-connect-collaborate-share/) . You can check out all of the great work at the 2015 schedule page (http://k12onlineconference.org/2015-schedule/) .

* Getting started in Medium: Reading, annotating, commenting, and recommending (http://wiobyrne.com/starting-medium-reading/) - As I mentioned last week, I joined a writing collective on Medium. In a related effort, I'm working with a group of colleagues to finally start up a writing group on Medium. I should have more info later. For now...we're scaling up by starting up Medium accounts, and learning how it all works.

## 📺 Watch

The Force Awakens Trailer - Music Only Edit

Yes, the new ** trailer for Star Wars: The Force Awakens (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGbxmsDFVnE)

was released this week. Yes, the ** Internet freaked out (http://www.wired.com/2015/10/star-wars-force-awakens-online-reaction/)

over it. What I love about this video is that it strips out the dialogue and accentuates the music in the production. You get a real feel for the ** mood and tone created by the music (http://www.slashfilm.com/star-wars-the-force-awakens-trailer-music/)

.

## 📚 Read

** N (http://billmoyers.com/2015/10/20/ten-great-writers-talk-to-bill-moyers-about-why-they-write/)

** ine great writers talk to Bill Moyers about why they write (http://billmoyers.com/2015/10/20/ten-great-writers-talk-to-bill-moyers-about-why-they-write/)

In this post, Bill Moyers shares video of interviews he conducted with great writers over time. The end result provides insight into how these minds work, synthesize, and create.

The writers include Toni Morrison, Norman Lear, MFK Fisher, Luis Alberto Urrea, Maxine Hong Kingston, Isaac Asimov, Robert Bly, Lucille Clifton, & W. S. Merwin.

** Web of Illusion: How the Internet affects our confidence in what we know (http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20151020-the-web-has-deluded-you-and-dont-pretend-it-hasnt)

This post by cognitive scientist ** Tom Stafford (https://twitter.com/tomstafford)

looks at our illusions of knowledge and our own beliefs in our intelligence as modified by the advent of the Internet. If the Internet is really changing how our minds operate...what effect does this have on our confidence and certainty about our thoughts?

** What happens to the brain during cognitive dissonance? (http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-happens-to-the-brain-during-cognitive-dissonance/)

One of my favorite concepts to teach in my Education classes focuses on cognitive dissonance and opportunities for learning. Cognitive dissonance is the state of mental stress or discomfort that occurs when you're trying to make sense of something that you're not previously accustomed to. It's when you hold two competing ideas in your head...or are confronted with information that conflicts with existing beliefs, ideas, or values.

This post from Keise Izuma at the ** Scientific American (http://www.scientificamerican.com/)

looks at the neural complexity of what happens during these states at the brain cell level.

** Professors shouldn't teach themselves to younger versions of themselves (http://www.slate.com/articles/life/education/2015/10/professors_shouldn_t_only_teach_to_younger_versions_of_themselves.html)

This post from ** Rebecca Shuman (https://twitter.com/pankisseskafka)

at ** Slate (http://www.slate.com/)

discusses the problems that exist when academics focus on model students as opposed to the real world ones that show up daily in their classrooms.

The American professoriate shouldn’t gear their courses exclusively to students who are so bright and motivated they could learn the material on their own. They should also include components designed for the average, real, very-much-not-ideal student they will actually meet.

I think this post provides insight for educators and instructors from Pre-K up through higher ed. I think it also provides keen insight into instructional design in online and hybrid spaces. This post begs questions about how we design and scale up MOOCs.

** Some rules of language are wired in the brain (http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/some-rules-of-language-are-wired-in-the-brain/)

This post by ** Madhuvanthi Kannan (https://twitter.com/mkannan3112)

, a postdoc at Yale studying neurobiology discusses the sound, symbol, and meaning relationships that are possibly hard wired into our brains. The post focuses on some research that suggests that as infants, our brains are essentially cross-wired to recognize sounds and symbols across languages and systems. As we grow and age in our specific language and culture, we lose this sensitivity to other languages and systems.

We've always considered this to be true...perhaps we're getting some more insight into engineering at the cellular level.

** Stanford researchers treat autism with Google Glass (http://techcrunch.com/2015/10/19/stanford-researchers-treat-autism-with-google-glass/?ncid=rss)

Interesting work from the Autism Glass Project that builds off of work from the ** MIT Media Lab (https://www.media.mit.edu/)

and ** Project Capture the Smile (https://www.media.mit.edu/research/groups/affective-computing)

. In short, the Google Glass is scanning the faces of other individuals, recognizing cues for engagement and emotions, and giving the wearer of the Google Glass some insight into motive and purpose of others. The hope is that this will help help autistic children recognize and classify emotions.

** Entropy explained in comic book form (https://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2015/10/03/sousanis/XOMd3JBYnEdzQCWHM6twTJ/story.html)

Ever since ** Nick Sousanis (https://twitter.com/nsousanis)

released ** his dissertation in graphic novel form (http://boingboing.net/2015/06/21/doctoral-dissertation-in-graph.html)

, he's been a deity in my world.

This piece is one of his nonfiction pieces in which he explains the connection between life and entropy. I thoroughly recommend clicking through to the link above from the Boston Globe to review the whole piece.

## 🔨 Do

I've discussed the past how much I love Vine and try to embed it into lessons and activities. But, have you ever thought about those six seconds in Vine seemed to be too long? Perhaps not. :)

But, I think you should check out the new app ** Boomerang (http://blog.instagram.com/post/131684343987/boomerang-from-instagram)

from ** Instagram (http://blog.instagram.com/)

. The app uses images and videos you created, and mixes in some of their ** Hyperlapse (http://blog.instagram.com/post/95829278497/hyperlapse-from-instagram)

secret sauce. The end result is a 1 second clip that mimics some of the magic in GIFs.

I'll play with this and see what I can do with it. Please share what you create.

## 🤔 Consider

We are all now connected by the Internet, like neurons in a giant brain.
