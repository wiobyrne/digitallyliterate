## It Goes On

**Published**: June 8, 2019 • [[03 CREATE/📧 Newsletter/📧 Newsletter\|📧 Newsletter]]

*Milestone issue - celebrating 200 issues of digital literacy curation and analysis*

Welcome to issue 200! I started this newsletter several years ago with the intention of curating during the week and distilling this down into an easy-to-read source for you to quickly consume. My goal was to provide the information & details you need to be digitally literate.

This week I posted: [Six criteria used to describe assessments](https://wiobyrne.com/six-criteria-used-to-describe-assessments/) - detailing some of the ways in which we talk about assessment in educational spaces.

### [Futurecraft 4D in partnership with Carbon and Adidas (1:34)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXE-icw28n8)

I'm super excited about the possibilities of 3D printing in our lives. The problem is that 3D printing always has questions about feasibility on a large scale.

That was until I watched [this video from Unbox Therapy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgAo-IZgm0E&feature=youtu.be) about a new Adidas sneaker and the ["Futurecraft 4D" printing process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlomslovAnI) used to create the sole. Imagine being able to scan your sole with your mobile device, and have a custom-fit shoe printed up for you.

### [Facebook's cryptocurrency will reportedly be announced this month](https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/6/18655366/facebook-cryptocurrency-libra-token-zuckerberg)

Facebook is reportedly planning to announce its cryptocurrency later this month. According to reports, the company will let users trade, store, and exchange its cryptocurrency for fiat currency through Facebook's apps, including Messenger and WhatsApp.

Facebook has been moving from scandal to scandal over the last couple of years. Cryptocurrencies and alt-coins are built on foundations of trust. It will be interesting to see if this initiative takes off.

### [Facebook shareholders try and fail to limit Mark Zuckerberg's power](https://mashable.com/article/facebook-shareholder-meeting-2019/)

Shareholders are furious at how Zuckerberg has handled Facebook scandals, including election interference in 2016 and the Cambridge Analytica data breach. They think the company would benefit from an independent chairman holding Zuckerberg accountable.

The investment structure means Zuckerberg owns a majority of the votes and will always control the company's destiny. This makes the cryptocurrency story even more interesting.

### [Breaking up Big Tech will be really hard to do—here's why](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/613617/breaking-up-big-tech-will-be-really-hard-to-do/)

The DoJ and FTC are preparing antitrust investigations into Amazon, Apple, Google, and Facebook. Martin Giles indicates regulators face a long road for three reasons:

- Big tech firms have generally made their services available for free
- They aren't "natural monopolies" 
- They dominate data gathering and use insights to provide even more free services

### [The Lost Common Spaces of Our Hyper-Segmented Lives](https://kottke.org/19/06/the-lost-common-spaces-of-our-hyper-segmented-lives)

After a vacation to Disney World, I was struck by how technology and customer segmentation have separated us into disparate groups. While our devices force us to be social only in digital spaces, we're losing physical common spaces for community connection.
