# TLDR 5

## Too Long; Didn't Read Issue 5

**Published**: 2015-06-27 • [[03 CREATE/📧 Newsletter/📧 Newsletter\|📧 Newsletter]]

Thank you once again for being one of the first to sign up for this newsletter. In this weekly email, I'll pull together some of the content that I shared out throughout the week. It's basically things that I think you should know & discuss. Please feel free to respond back, and share out with others.

This week I posted:

* [Describing the Complex Systems that Influence & Guide My Workflow](http://wiobyrne.com/describing-the-complex-systems-that-influence-guide-workflow/) and earned the [Advanced Kanban Badge](http://badges.p2pu.org/en/badge/view/748/) from [Doug Belshaw](http://dougbelshaw.com/blog/2015/07/13/advanced-kanban-badge/).

* [Scaffolding students (and educators) as they consume, curate, & create online](http://wiobyrne.com/scaffolding-students-and-educators-as-they-consume-curate-create-online/)

I had the privilege of presenting a keynote at the 2015 New Literacies Institute at NCSU. I worked with an amazing cohort of teachers from NC and China as they develop collaborative, inquiry-based units. My materials for this session are available above in the "Scaffolding Students" post. I also presented a "cool tools" session on Vine ([Play With Digital Media, Stop-motion Animation, & Vine to Earn the #VineOff Badge](http://wiobyrne.com/play-with-digital-media-stop-motion-animation-vine-to-earn-the-vineoff-badge/)) and urged them to earn the #VineOff badge by [clicking here](http://badges.p2pu.org/en/badge/view/754/).

My time at the NLI was incredible and I left with a ton of ideas...and questions about our role as educators and how publicly should we advocate, or speak out online for freedoms and literacy. I'll have more on that in a future post.

## 📺 Watch

[Chuck Jones - The Evolution of an Artist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHpXle4NqWI)

Great clip from [Every Frame a Painting](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjFqcJQXGZ6T6sxyFB-5i6A) looking at the evolution of Chuck Jones into a master of comedic animation. It's fascinating to watch how experts create, and the thinking behind the process.

## 📚 Read

### [On Social Media, Silence, and Things That Matter](http://www.hybridpedagogy.com/journal/on-social-media-silence-and-things-that-matter/)

Excellent piece from [Lee Skallerup Bessette](https://twitter.com/readywriting)
on the work that needs to be done in and out of our classrooms given current events.

As educators and school leaders, we can no longer hide behind the privilege of “not knowing.”

I also suggest reading & considering [this post](http://dogtrax.edublogs.org/2015/07/18/dont-give-up-change-the-system-from-within/)

by [Kevin Hodgson](https://twitter.com/dogtrax) .

### [7 Questions to Ask Regarding Whether Education Technology Improves Learning](http://www.ictineducation.org/home-page/2015/7/23/7-questions-to-ask-regarding-whether-education-technology-im.html)

A list of questions from [Terry Freedman](https://twitter.com/terryfreedman)
to ask after you question whether learning is improved through the use/integration of tech.

What Education Technology?

What other factors are present?

What is the Education Technology being used for?

How is the impact of the Education Technology being evaluated?

What exactly is being measured?

How much is Education Technology being used?

Is there an "experimenter" effect going on?

### [When we read, we recognize words as pictures and hear them spoken aloud](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/when-we-read-we-recognize-words-as-pictures-and-hear-them-spoken-aloud/)

Piece from [Scientific American](http://www.scientificamerican.com/)
discussing research in neuroscience looking at what happens in our brains as we read. Results suggest that words are not simply encoded in the brain by their meaning but by simpler attributes such as sound and shape.

### [Why we can\'t put our phones down](http://psychcentral.com/blog/archives/2015/07/22/why-we-cant-put-our-phones-down/)

Post on our inability to disconnect from our devices and self-regulate the intensity of our own lives.

Comedian Louis C.K. quoted in the post - “You need to build an ability to just be yourself and not do anything. That’s what the phone is taking away is the ability to just sit there. That’s being a person.”

### [The Test That Can Look Into a Child\'s Reading Future](http://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2015/07/21/423260864/the-test-that-can-look-into-a-childs-reading-future?utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=education)

This story on NPR's Morning Edition sparked a lot of discussion (vitriol) in my online personal learning networks. I'll leave my thoughts out of this and just ask that you read and make up your own mind. I would like to know more about the research, the subjects, and follow-up field testing.

### [Somehow Teen Girls Get the Coolest Wearable Out There](http://www.wired.com/2015/07/somehow-teen-girls-get-coolest-wearable/)

Piece from WIRED looking at the Jewelbot, a "friendship bracelet that teaches girls to code." You can find out more here from their [Kickstarter page](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1345510482/jewelbots-friendship-bracelets-that-teach-girls-to) , or view the [video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xr-8tYfIzsU) .

Love the story and the initiative...hate the title from WIRED.

### [Student Self-Publishing - An Essential Part of 21st Century Learning](http://www.educatorstechnology.com/2015/07/student-self-publishing-essential-part.html?m=1)

The need for students to create and publish content online. The post includes some guidance on some digital texts and tools to make this happen. Once again, the primary concern in online content construction might just be protecting students and their content as they interact and share online.

### [An awesome guide to typography for you and your students]

[Butterick\'s Practical Typography](http://practicaltypography.com/) is a web-published book on typography for the general audience. The book is beautiful, educational and designed for the web. If you (or your students) build, design, and publish online...this resource is a must.

## 🔨 Do

### [The Animation Station](http://www.instructables.com/id/The-Animation-Station/)

Check out this incredible tutorial from [Instructables](http://www.instructables.com/)
showing the development of an animation station. This gives me a ton of ideas about what can be done with video, technology...and a little creativity.

The full video is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wInCaB964E) .

## 🤔 Consider

As we navigate the evolving digital landscape, consider how these tools and trends shape our relationship with technology, information, and each other.
