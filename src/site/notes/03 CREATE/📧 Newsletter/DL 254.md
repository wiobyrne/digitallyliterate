## Setback for Civil Rights

**Published**: 2020-07-11 • [[03 CREATE/📧 Newsletter/📧 Newsletter\|📧 Newsletter]]

Welcome to *Digitally Literate*, issue 254.

This week I was honored (humbled) to be one of the recipients of the [Divergent Award for Excellence in 21st Century Literacies from the Initiative for 21st Century Literacies Research](http://www.initiativefor21research.org/the-divergent-award.html) .

This is for recent research on how digital activists and average citizens take advantage of new technologies to provide an alternative way of organizing in order to push back against harmful societal narratives.

Dozens of teachers, parents and district leaders around the country are embroiled in how to open up schools in a little over a month.

States, districts and the federal government are [pushing](https://www.npr.org/2020/07/07/888157257/white-house-pushes-to-reopen-schools-despite-a-surge-in-coronavirus-cases) and [pulling](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/08/nyregion/nyc-schools-reopening-plan.html) in different directions. Scientists are [updating their advice](https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/07/08/888853601/school-reopenings-should-keep-public-health-in-mind-pediatric-group-says?utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=nprblogscoronavirusliveupdates) to reflect emerging research and the changing course of the pandemic. Parents and educators are finding it hard to make decisions in the confusion.

[Ultimately, students will go back to school, but not back to normal](https://www.npr.org/2020/07/09/888878030/when-it-comes-to-reopening-schools-the-devil-s-in-the-details-educators-say) .

[This primer from Good Housekeeping](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/a33251177/is-it-safe-to-go-back-to-school-coronavirus/) shares the four risks to consider as you prepare for back-to-school. School and classroom size, population density, local rates of COVID-19 transmission, and greatly influences the likelihood of your child getting sick.

** [Defund Facial Recognition](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2020/07/defund-facial-recognition/613771/)

[On a Thursday afternoon in January, Robert Julian-Borchak Williams was in his office at an automotive supply company when he got a call from the Detroit Police Department telling him to come to the station to be arrested. His case combines flawed technology with poor police work, illustrating how facial recognition can go awry](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/24/technology/facial-recognition-arrest.html) .

[Last year, a 25-year-old Detroit man was wrongly accused](https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2020/07/10/facial-recognition-detroit-michael-oliver-robert-williams/5392166002/) of a felony for supposedly reaching into a teacher’s vehicle, grabbing a cellphone and throwing it, cracking the screen and breaking the case.

Rooted in discredited pseudoscience and racist eugenics theories that claim to use facial structure and head shape to assess mental capacity and character, automated facial-recognition software uses artificial intelligence, machine learning, and other forms of modern computing to capture the details of people’s faces and compare that information to existing photo databases with the goal of identifying, verifying, categorizing, and locating people.

** [Facebook’s Decisions Were ‘Setbacks for Civil Rights,’ Audit Finds](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/08/technology/facebook-civil-rights-audit.html)

An independent audit faulted the social network for allowing hate speech and disinformation to thrive — potentially posing a threat to the November elections.

[Civil rights groups say company did not commit to concrete plan to address hate speech and misinformation. Facebook thinks that just showing up is part of the solution](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jul/07/facebook-boycott-hate-speech-mark-zuckerberg-meeting) .

** [Can You Teach a ‘Transformative’ Humanities Course Online?](https://www.chronicle.com/article/Can-You-Teach-a/249152/)

[Lee Skallerup Bessette](https://readywriting.org/) discussing a need to approach online teaching from a willingness to recognize its potential.

Keep in mind, too, that most online courses are not transformative experiences. But neither are most courses taught in face-to-face classrooms. On any campus, you can find in-person classes that are good, bad, or transformative. To expect every online course to be either transformative or not worth your attention is an unrealistic standard that academe doesn’t impose on traditional classes.

[The kids and I loved this video on Why Americans eat dessert for breakfast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNovwPIWr3Q&feature=youtu.be) . [We then followed it up with this video on How I stopped hating breakfast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVvFRE6yNPk) .

One of the breakfast meals that Johnny Harris suggests is hummus. This weekend we’re going to make up a fresh batch and enjoy it.

What do you eat for breakfast?

## 🤔 Consider

> "For the master's tools will never dismantle the master's house. They may allow us to temporarily beat him at his own game, but they will never enable us to bring about genuine change. Racism and homophobia are real conditions of all our lives in this place and time. I urge each one of us here to reach down into that deep place of knowledge inside herself and touch that terror and loathing of any difference that lives here. See whose face it wears. Then the personal as the political can begin to illuminate all our choices."
