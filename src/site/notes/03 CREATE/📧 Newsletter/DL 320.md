### 2. **[The country inoculating against disinformation](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20220128-the-country-inoculating-against-disinformation)**  
Estonia, known for its digital advancements, ranks among the top nations in media literacy. The country’s proactive response to cyber threats offers a model for digital resilience.  

Although Estonia has a population of just 1.3 million, it is known as one of the world's most digitally advanced countries. Last year the tiny nation ranked third in the 2021 [Media Literacy Index](https://osis.bg/?p=3750&lang=en), compiled by the European Policies Initiative of the Open Society Institute (OSI), behind Finland and Denmark.
**Why this matters**: Strengthening media literacy helps combat disinformation and build informed societies.

1. How do we verify the accuracy of data on the blockchain?  
2. How do we ensure the physical item matches its blockchain entry?

### 5. **[EARN IT Act Returns](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/02/its-back-senators-want-earn-it-bill-scan-all-online-messages)**  
I've talked about the EARN IT Act previously here in this newsletter. Well...it's back again.

The new [EARN IT Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/3538) still [threatens encryption and stifles free speech online](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/07/new-earn-it-bill-still-threatens-encryption-and-free-speech).

This seems to be more about a lot of scanning and not a lot of protection for users of the web. the new EARN IT Act would pave the way for a massive new surveillance system, run by private companies, that would roll back some of the most important privacy and security features in technology used by people around the globe.

If you're in the US, [take action here](https://act.eff.org/action/stop-the-earn-it-act-to-save-our-privacy).

**Why this matters**: Advocacy and awareness are crucial to defending digital rights.

### 6. **[Better output by working less?](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/coronavirus-leading-through-the-crisis/charting-the-path-to-the-next-normal/give-me-a-break)**  
Survey results indicate that “circuit breaker” holidays during the pandemic improved employee mental health and morale.  
**Why this matters**: Prioritizing rest and recovery can lead to sustained productivity and well-being.

## 🛠️ DO: How to Make the Most of Your 24 Hours  

[Leo Babuta](https://leobabauta.com/) outlines the challenges of _time scarcity_ and possible ways to deal with this. Time scarcity is when we feel rushed like there’s not enough time to do everything, we're always behind, or never feel like we’re doing enough.

1. Be intentional at the start of each day.  
2. Focus on what matters most instead of trying to do everything.  
3. Create moments of transcendence.  
4. Reflect with gratitude.
