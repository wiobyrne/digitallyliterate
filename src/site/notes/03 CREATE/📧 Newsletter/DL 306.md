- **[The Best Questions Are Naive Questions](https://wiobyrne.com/the-best-questions-are-naive-questions/)** â€“ Believing naive questions sometimes set us on different, valuable paths

## ðŸ”– Key Takeaways
- **Algorithm Dominance**: Complex computer programs increasingly determine everything from stock prices to movie scripts and urban architecture
- **Emoji Communication Evolution**: Digital expression tools like the melting face emoji enhance emotional communication in text-based interactions
- **Facebook Content Failures**: Internal documents reveal weak responses to drug cartels and human trafficking on the platform

### [How algorithms shape our world - Kevin Slavin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENWVRcMGDoU&t=3s)
[Kevin Slavin](https://about.me/slavin) argues we're living in a world designed forâ€”and increasingly controlled byâ€”algorithms. This riveting talk demonstrates how complex computer programs determine espionage tactics, stock prices, movie scripts, and architectural design.

Slavin warns we're writing code we can't understand with implications we can't control. Understanding algorithmic influence becomes critical for informed decision-making and ethical technology development.

### [The Melting Face Emoji Has Already Won Us Over](https://www.nytimes.com/2021-09-29/style/melting-face-emoji-unicode.html)
I absolutely love using emoticons, emoji, and GIFs in digital communications. Initially, I felt foolish thinking it inappropriate for an English teacher and literacy researcher to use these forms of text. [Doug Belshaw](https://dougbelshaw.com/) suggested that meaning and tone often get lost in online text, making emotional cues essential for typed conversation clarity.

I'm embracing this melting face emoji for my permanent repertoire.

The first [emojis were created in 1999 by Shigetaka Kurita](https://www.cnn.com/style/article/emoji-shigetaka-kurita-standards-manual/index.html), finding inspiration in manga. The original 176 emojis now belong to the [Museum of Modern Art](https://stories.moma.org/the-original-emoji-set-has-been-added-to-the-museum-of-modern-arts-collection-c6060e141f61) permanent collection.

Embracing playful communication methods enhances digital literacy and expression capabilities.

### [Facebook Employees Flag Drug Cartels and Human Traffickers. The Company's Response Is Weak, Documents Show.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-drug-cartels-human-traffickers-response-is-weak-documents-11631812953?mod=article_inline)
Continuing the [Facebook Files investigation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-facebook-files-11631713039?mod=bigtop-breadcrumb), internal documents revealed Facebook's awareness of drug cartels and human traffickers using the platform in developing countries, but the company took minimal action.

In some countries, Facebook lacks people who speak dialects needed to identify criminal platform uses. In these places, it deems harm "simply the cost of doing business," according to a former Facebook vice president. One document revealed the company suggested using "a light touch" with Arabic-language human trafficking warnings to avoid "alienating buyers."

Facebook's systematic flaws are understated. [Kate Klonick](https://kateklonick.com/) asks [what will we do about it](https://www.nytimes.com/2021-10-01/opinion/facebook-files-content-moderation-zuckerberg.html)?

Systemic content moderation flaws highlight the urgent need for social media platform accountability.

### [What almost 150 studies say about how to motivate students](https://hechingerreport.org/proof-points-what-almost-150-studies-say-about-how-to-motivate-students/)
A meta-analysis of over 144 studies on student motivation from elementary through university suggests teachers are more influential than parents. [Pathways to Student Motivation: A Meta-Analysis of Antecedents of Autonomous and Controlled Motivations](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/epub/10.3102/00346543211042426) by Julien S. Bureau, Joshua L. Howard, Jane X. Y. Chong, & FrÃ©dÃ©ric Guay was published in September 2021's Review of Educational Research.

Concrete teacher actions may seem unrelated to student motivation initially: teachers listen to student thoughts and feelings with empathetic responses. Another suggestion involves explaining rules and requirements so students understand reasoning behind expectations. Recommendations include giving students choices and allowing assignment personalization.

Small, intentional educator actions can significantly impact student engagement and learning outcomes.

### [So You've Decided to Hate Greta Thunberg](https://jamesfell.substack.com/p/so-youve-decided-to-hate-greta-thunberg)
Following events leading to the [Cop26 climate summit](https://ukcop26.org/) in Glasgow, UK, starting October 31st, [Greta Thunberg](https://twitter.com/gretathunberg) received significant attention, especially for her ["blah, blah, blah" comments](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/sep/28/blah-greta-thunberg-leaders-climate-crisis-co2-emissions).

The level of hate and vitriol adults direct toward this individual surprises me. Radio discussion hosts proceeded to call Thunberg horrible things, stopped to check her age to "see if she was old enough to say these things," then continued their diatribe.

[James Fell's piece in the Sweary History newsletter](https://jamesfell.substack.com/) provides the perfect response to such individuals.

Youth activists like Greta challenge the status quo, inspiring action and debate on critical global issues.

### [Slow Down With These Serene City-Building Games](https://www.wired.com/story/serene-city-building-games-islanders-townscaper-cloud-gardens/)
During stressful times, more people play video games than ever before. We're seeing "string of trance-like game experiences in recent years; slowly expanding towns lull the mind, alleviating stress in a manner altogether less frenetic than regular blockbuster titles."

Consider checking out [*Islanders*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1046030/ISLANDERS/), [*Townscaper*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1291340/Townscaper/), [*Cloud Gardens*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1372320/Cloud_Gardens/), and [*Dorfromantik*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1455840/Dorfromantik/) on Steam.

Stress-relieving games offer mental clarity and balance during hectic periods.

## ðŸ¤” Consider

### Join with all those who experiment, take risks, fall, get hurt, and then take more risks. Stay away from those who affirm truths, who criticize those who do not think like them, people who have never once taken a step unless they were sure they would be respected for doing so, and who prefer certainties to doubts.
*Paulo Coelho*

This powerful call to intellectual courage connects perfectly with the themes explored throughout this issue. Greta Thunberg embodies this experimental spiritâ€”taking enormous risks to challenge established power structures despite intense criticism. The research on student motivation shows that teachers who encourage questioning and risk-taking create more engaged learners than those who demand conformity.

Coelho's wisdom reminds us that algorithmic systems, social media platforms, and educational institutions too often reward certainty over curiosity, compliance over creativity. Whether we're exploring ungrading, developing climate solutions, or creating more humane technology, progress requires embracing uncertainty and supporting those brave enough to take meaningful risks.

### Newsletter Evolution Note
Issue #306 demonstrates Ian's sophisticated integration of technological criticism (algorithms), cultural analysis (emoji communication), investigative journalism (Facebook Files), educational research (motivation studies), and political commentary (Greta Thunberg). This synthesis shows his growing ability to connect individual choices with systemic patterns while maintaining hope for positive change. The inclusion of stress-relief gaming recommendations alongside serious policy critiques reveals his understanding that sustainability requires balance between engagement and self-care.
