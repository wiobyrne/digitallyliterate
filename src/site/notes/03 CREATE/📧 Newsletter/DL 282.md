### [I Am Awesome - Sekou Andrews](http://sekouandrews.com/)

A hilarious, inspirational spoken word video by [Sekou Andrews](http://sekouandrews.com/), the world's leading Poetic Voice. It features "awesomnacious" people—from celebrities and scientists to social activists and 7-year-olds—hitting the awesome pose to declare their place in the GLOBAL COMMUNITY OF AWESOMENESS.

Please share this with someone who needs to hear and believe: "I Am Awesome!"

## 📚 Read

### [Lessons from a Year of Covid](https://www.ft.com/yuval-noah-harari)

Anything that [Yuval Noah Harari](https://www.ynharari.com/) writes...we need to read.

> How can we summarize the Covid year from a broad historical perspective? Many people believe the terrible toll coronavirus has taken demonstrates humanity's helplessness in the face of nature's might. In fact, 2020 has shown that humanity is far from helpless. Epidemics are no longer uncontrollable forces of nature. Science has turned them into a manageable challenge.

The vaccines developed in record time weren't miracles—they were the predictable result of sustained investment in scientific infrastructure. What we do with that knowledge determines what happens next.

### [How Right-Wing Disinformation Tore One Family Apart](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/interactive/2021/disinformation-conspiracy-family/)

QAnon is the [mass delusion](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/drumoorhouse/qanon-mass-collective-delusion-buzzfeed-news-copy-desk) that a Satan-worshipping cabal of child sex traffickers controlled the world and only Trump could stop them. Although an [American invention](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/03/10/qanon-japan-germany-colombia-conspiracy-theories-disinformation/), variants have spread globally.

The media increasingly shares stories of families torn apart—relatives living in fantasy worlds, caught between two realities.

> [With no overlap between our filters of reality, I was at a loss for any facts that would actually stick.](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/albertsamaha/qanon-parents-millennial-children)

When information ecosystems diverge completely, persuasion becomes nearly impossible.

### [Are Your Diversity Strategies Missing the Mark? Nine Ways to Get It Right](https://www.cultofpedagogy.com/diversity-strategies/)

A great post by [Hedreich Nichols](https://twitter.com/Hedreich) on Cult of Pedagogy. Nichols writes from the perspective of the OBF (one black friend) about small, intentional changes you can make:

- Read, read, read
- Be open to feedback
- Expand your circle
- Get comfortable with being uncomfortable
- Don't forget gender
- Beware "imperceptible" distance
- Validate code switching
- Embrace the elephant in the room
- Identify and fight bias

### [Everyone Has an Eschatology](https://dougbelshaw.com/blog/2021/03/08/deep-adaptation/)

A great post by [Doug Belshaw](https://dougbelshaw.com/) about eschatology—the branch of theology concerned with the end of the world or humankind.

I've been reading about risk and climate change. Belshaw is on this journey too, and our paths led us to the [Deep Adaptation paper](https://jembendell.com/2019/05/15/deep-adaptation-versions/) by [Dr. Jem Bendell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jem_Bendell).

Doug challenges us to realign work around the 4Rs:

- **Resilience**: "How do we keep what we really want to keep?"
- **Relinquishment**: "What do we need to let go of to not make matters worse?"
- **Restoration**: "What can we bring back to help with coming difficulties?"
- **Reconciliation**: "With what and whom can we make peace as we face our mutual mortality?"

### [Lou Ottens, Inventor of the Cassette Tape, Has Died](https://www.npr.org/2021/03/10/975598869/lou-ottens-inventor-of-the-cassette-tape-has-died)

Lou Ottens, who put music lovers on a path toward playlists and mixtapes by leading the invention of the first cassette tape, has died at age 94. At Philips, he also helped develop consumer compact discs.

> "Lou wanted music to be portable and accessible," says documentary filmmaker Zack Taylor, who spent days with Ottens for his film [Cassette: A Documentary Mixtape](https://www.cassettefilm.com/).

Born in 1926, Ottens went from building a radio for his family during World War II—reportedly with a directional antenna to focus on radio signals despite Nazi jamming attempts—to developing technology that would democratize music.

## 🔨 Do

### [Seven Reasons to Show Your Work](https://www.youtube.com/john-spencer)

John Spencer with seven reasons to show your work:

- Showing your work encourages metacognition
- Innovation skyrockets when people show their work
- They become mentors
- It can lead to collaborative partnerships
- You can change the narrative
- Sharing your journey can help build courage
- Students embrace the revision process

Making thinking visible benefits everyone—the sharer learns through articulation, and others learn through access.

## 🤔 Consider

### You are the sky. Everything else is just the weather.

*Pema Chödrön*

Chödrön's wisdom about permanence and impermanence connects to this issue's threads—the Deep Adaptation framework asking what we keep and release, families divided by divergent realities, and Lou Ottens's technology that changed how we carry music. Life must be lived forwards, but we get to choose what we carry.
