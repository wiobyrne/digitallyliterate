## [Yuval Noah Harari: Lessons from a year of Covid](https://www.ft.com/content/f1b30f2c-84aa-4595-84f2-7816796d6841)

Anything that [Yuval Noah Harari](https://www.ynharari.com/) writes...we need to read. 

How can we summarize the Covid year from a broad historical perspective? Many people believe that the terrible toll coronavirus has taken demonstrates humanity’s helplessness in the face of nature’s might. In fact, 2020 has shown that humanity is far from helpless. Epidemics are no longer uncontrollable forces of nature. Science has turned them into a manageable challenge.

## [How right-wing disinformation and conspiracy theories tore one family apart](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/interactive/2021/disinformation-conspiracy-family/)

QAnon is the [mass delusion](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/drumoorhouse/qanon-mass-collective-delusion-buzzfeed-news-copy-desk) that a Satan-worshipping cabal of child sex traffickers controlled the world and the only person standing in their way was Trump. Although it [started as a American invention](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021-03-10/qanon-japan-germany-colombia-conspiracy-theories-disinformation/), we're seeing variants throughout the globe.

The media is increasingly sharing these stories of families that are being torn apart as they describe relatives that are living in a fantasy world, or caught between two realities.

A great post by [Hedreich Nichols](https://twitter.com/Hedreich) on the Cult of Pedagogy blog. Nichols writes from the perspective of the OBF (one black friend) about the small, intentional changes you can make to better relate to the world around you.

- Embrace the elephant in the room
- Identify and fight bias

## [Everyone has an eschatology](https://dougbelshaw.com/blog/2021-03-08/deep-adaptation/)

A great post by [Doug Belshaw](https://dougbelshaw.com/) about eschatology, or the branch of theology that is concerned with the end of the world or of humankind.

I've been doing quite a bit of reading about risk and climate change over the last couple of months. Belshaw is on this journey as well and our stumbles have led us to the [Deep Adaptation paper](https://jembendell.com/2019-05-15/deep-adaptation-versions/) by [Dr. Jem Bendell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jem_Bendell). 

Doug challenges us to realign your work around the 4Rs outlined by Bendell.

- Resilience asks us “how do we keep what we really want to keep?”
- Relinquishment asks us “what do we need to let go of in order to not make matters worse?”
- Restoration asks us “what can we bring back to help us with the coming difficulties and tragedies?”
- Reconciliation asks “with what and whom can we make peace with as we face our mutual mortality?” 

## [Lou Ottens, Inventor Of The Cassette Tape, Has Died](https://www.npr.org/2021-03-10/975598869/lou-ottens-inventor-of-the-cassette-tape-has-died)

Lou Ottens, who put music lovers around the world on a path toward playlists and mixtapes by leading the invention of the first cassette tape, has died at age 94, according to media reports in the Netherlands. Ottens was a talented and influential engineer at Philips, where he also helped develop consumer compact discs.

"Lou wanted music to be portable and accessible," says documentary filmmaker Zack Taylor, who spent days with Ottens for his film [Cassette: A Documentary Mixtape](https://www.cassettefilm.com/).

Born in 1926, Ottens went from building a radio for his family during World War II — it reportedly had a directional antenna so it could focus on radio signals despite Nazi jamming attempts — to developing technology that would democratize music.

## 🤔 Consider

### Life's work is to wake up, to let the things that enter into your life wake you up rather than put you to sleep. The only way to do this is to open, be curious, and develop some sense of sympathy for everything that comes along, to get to know its nature and let it teach you what it will.
