** Too Long; Didn't Read (TL;DR) #11

Thank you once again for signing up for this newsletter. We're now up over 100 subscribers...and on to issue #11. Thanks again for the support. :)

This week I posted:

* Hybrid and Blended Learning: Modifying pedagogy across time, place, path, and pace (http://wiobyrne.com/hybrid-blended-learning-modifying-pedagogy-across-time-place-path-and-pace/) - My latest column was published in JAAL this week. This piece is meant to provide guidance for educators as they try to understand what is meant by the terms "blended" and "hybrid." You can access the pre-production copy on the blog post, or the print version on Academia.edu (https://www.academia.edu/15304764/Hybrid_and_Blended_Learning_Modifying_pedagogy_across_path_place_time_and_place) . I'm reaching out to experts in the field to schedule interviews to add to the piece. I'll share more on that later.

* The Life and Death of a Literacy & Technology Program (http://wiobyrne.com/itdml/) - This post is from a piece that I submitted to Reflections, the in-house newsletter from UNH. In the post, I describe the thought process and work that went into the IT&DML program that I helped create at UNH. I have been documenting all of the decisions, work, and materials over the life of the program. I thought it was important that I share the end of the program...or at least the end for now. :)

## 📚 Read

** Study delivers bleak verdict on validity of psychology experiment results (http://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/aug/27/study-delivers-bleak-verdict-on-validity-of-psychology-experiment-results)

This post came up just as I was sending out last week's newsletter. The piece discusses ** research presented in Science Magazine (http://www.sciencemag.org/content/349/6251/aac4716)

that looks at100 studies published in top-ranking journals in 2008 and shows that 75% of social psychology experiments and half of cognitive studies failed the replication test. Read more at ** Science Daily (http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/08/150827154242.htm)

and ** MindHacks (http://mindhacks.com/2015/08/28/dont-call-it-a-comeback/)

.

I definitely agree with the final thoughts from Vaughan Bell on MindHacks:

"The main take home messages are that findings published in leading journals are not a good guide to invariant aspects of human nature. And stop with the journal worship. And let’s get more pre-registration on the go. Plus science is hard."

** Oliver Sacks has left the building (http://mindhacks.com/2015/08/30/oliver-sacks-has-left-the-building/)

** Back to school with annotation: 10 ways to annotate with students (https://hypothes.is/blog/back-to-school-with-annotation-10-ways-to-annotate-with-students/)

Great post from ** Jeremy Dean (https://twitter.com/dr_jdean)

and ** Hypothes.is (https://hypothes.is/)

looking at opportunities to annotate the web in your classroom. Hypothes.is is a powerful, open tool that can be used to add a layer of commentary to the Internet and ** building  (https://hypothes.is/about/)

conversation.

I have written a lot of about ** Genius (http://genius.com/)

in our classrooms. I'm switching over to Hypothes.is.

Insight from Lisa Conquergood and her photo editing site Picnik when they were acquired by Google. I value posts like this because they provide insight on possibilities to work in an agile environment, and the future of work.

The recommendations:

1. Use technology to keep remote employees close

2. Eliminate silos

3. Master your inbox

4. Set goals before meetings

** hat is "malvertising" and how do you protect yourself? (http://www.howtogeek.com/227205/what-is-malvertising-and-how-do-you-protect-yourself/)

Read up on the ways in which your web browser and plug-ins might be used to track and possibly attack you. I also recommend checking out the ** following browser extensions (http://lifehacker.com/the-best-browser-extensions-that-protect-your-privacy-479408034)

that you can use to protect your privacy online.

In terms of Chrome extensions, I uninstalled AdBlock, and have been using ** uBlock Origin (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en)

. At this point, I feel like it's speeding up my page loads, but we'll see. I also have been using...and love ** Facebook Flat (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/facebook-flat/kadbillinepbjlgenaliokdhejdmmlgp?hl=en)

. It cuts all of the junk out of Facebook pages.

in Google Drive apps. I'm most excited about ** voice typing (http://time.com/4020661/google-docs-voice-typing/)

built in. I'm wondering if that might be a solution for transcription of audio and video clips. I'll test it out soon. :)

It's always fun to share links this with tools that scrape your online information and draw up a profile for you. This allows us to consider how the information we share might be interpreted by others. This also serves as a wake-up call for those of us that think that we're relatively anonymous online.

The ** Apply Magic Sauce Prediction (http://applymagicsauce.com/test.html)

API from the University of Cambridge examines your digital footprint to provide a detailed psychological profile.

My "psycho-demographic profile" suggests that I'm 26, mostly masculine, more intelligent than 51% of the population...and only more satisfied with life than 47% of the population. :(

## 🔨 Do

I love ** Vine (https://vine.co/)

. I've used Vine in ** classes and presentations before (http://wiobyrne.com/play-with-digital-media-stop-motion-animation-vine-to-earn-the-vineoff-badge/)

. I've created a ** #VineOff badge (http://badges.p2pu.org/en/badge/view/754/)

. To learn more about Vine, check out these ** excellent guidelines (http://claremontcomms.com/2014/02/how-to-create-your-first-vine/)

and ** tutorials (http://www.gcflearnfree.org/vine)

as you get started.

As students start playing with digital content, it's important to find apps that will them to quickly and simply mess around and create something new. There are several good apps teachers can use with students to quickly and easily play with digital content. ** Animoto (https://animoto.com/)

and ** VoiceThread (https://voicethread.com/)

are two that I've shared in the past.

This new feature of Vine adds in music tracks and allows students to easily fold in music to their content. This should lead to interesting discussions as they see what the addition of music does to their work.

The first step is to install Vine on your device...and start playing.
