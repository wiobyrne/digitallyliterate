# TLDR 1

## Too Long; Didn't Read Issue 1

**Published**: 2015-06-27 • [[03 CREATE/📧 Newsletter/📧 Newsletter\|📧 Newsletter]]

Welcome to TL;DR!

Thank you for being one of the first to sign up for my newsletter. In this weekly email, I'll pull together some of the content that I shared out throughout the week. It's basically things that I think you should know and discuss. Please feel free to respond back, and share out with others.

This week I traveled to Charleston to find a new home for my family. I also wrapped up the [final week](http://wiobyrne.com/your-digital-identity-as-an-educator-ormsmooc-ed6671/) of the [ORMS MOOC](http://wiobyrne.com/join-the-orms-mooc/). I've been heavily involved in [revising my blog](http://wiobyrne.com/critique-construction-website/) ...and starting this newsletter. :) Finally, I got [started](https://plus.google.com/+IanOByrne/posts/AnMcHkFMRg3) in the [CLMOOC](https://plus.google.com/communities/111619469354411254407).

## 📚 Read

** [Americans' Internet Access: 2000-2015](http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/06/26/americans-internet-access-2000-2015/)

As internet use nears saturation for some groups, a look at patterns of adoption.

Key takeaways - the Internet is blowing up. :) The digital divides based on race, ethnicity, and education appear to be shrinking. Read the [full report here](http://www.pewinternet.org/files/2015/06/2015-06-26_internet-usage-across-demographics-discover_FINAL.pdf).

** [Is Google listening to you?](http://www.psfk.com/2015/06/google-eavesdropping-tool-audio-snooping-code-privacy.html)

Another round of technopanic is spreading through the Internet as the open source version of Chrome was found to have some of the same [audio capture code](http://www.psfk.com/2015/06/google-eavesdropping-tool-audio-snooping-code-privacy.html) that is contained in Chrome. In a [further examination of the code](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/google-eavesdropping-chromium-users/), it appears that Google made a mistake and is addressing it. The key takeaway is that our devices are listening to us. We need to know and understand what they are doing. Teach your kids to code. :)

** [Chuck Palahniuk Reads 'Fight Club for Kids'](http://laughingsquid.com/author-chuck-palahniuk-reads-fight-club-for-kids-a-childrens-book-version-of-his-popular-book-fight-club/)

Sorry...I love Chuck's books. :)

** Sesame Street was the first MOOC?!?!

Interesting back and forth here. University of Maryland's Melissa Kearney and Wellesley College's Phillip Levine [show possible replacement](https://www.edsurge.com/n/2015-06-09-the-original-mooc-can-sesame-street-replace-preschool) of pre-school through [viewing of Sesame Street](http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/sesame-street-and-its-surprisingly-powerful-effects-on-how-children-learn/2015/06/07/59c73fe4-095c-11e5-9e39-0db921c47b93_story.html). The Brookings Institute [calls Sesame Street the first MOOC](http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/brookings-now/posts/2015/06/sesame-street-was-the-original-mooc). [Audrey Watters](http://hackeducation.com/2015/06/21/sesame-street-is-not-a-mooc-ffs/) and [Stephen Downes](http://www.downes.ca/cgi-bin/page.cgi?post=64063) quickly debunk that thinking.

** [Lexus finally gives us the Back to the Future hoverboard?](http://www.wired.com/2015/06/lexus-hoverboard-slide/)

I want to believe that before I die...these will finally be a reality. :)

** [Molson and Google team up to build a beer dispensing, language translating mini-fridge](http://techcrunch.com/2015/06/26/molson-and-google-built-a-beer-fridge-that-unlocks-via-voice-translation/?ncid=rss)

This is really good...and really bad.

** [Boo at the Confederate flag til it burns. It'll probably make you feel better](http://boingboing.net/2015/06/26/boo-at-the-confederate-flag-ti.html)

Interesting use of gaming and technology as activism and social commentary. It reminds me of the [Facebook Mood Survey response](http://wiobyrne.com/the-facepalm-social-mood-experiment/) I had last year.

** [Amazing Pictures: Baby Chameleon Doesn't Know It Hatched](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/06/amazing-pictures--baby-chameleon-doesn-t-know-it-hatched/)

:)

## 🔨 Do

** [Make your own Raspberry Pi weather station](http://lifehacker.com/build-your-own-raspberry-pi-powered-weather-station-1697061082)

I shared out [this link](http://techcrunch.com/2015/06/26/teach-kids-tech-and-life-with-a-pi-powered-diy-camera-trap/?ncid=rss#.hafbhd:WFPZ) looking at a Kickstarter attempt to build a fancy weather station using the incredible Raspberry Pi. It reminded me that there are a ton of possibilities ([one](http://lifehacker.com/build-your-own-raspberry-pi-powered-weather-station-1697061082), [two](https://www.raspberrypi.org/school-weather-station-project/), [three](http://airpi.es/)) to build your own weather station using cheap parts and a little bit of time.

## 🤔 Consider

> "The key takeaway is that our devices are listening to us. We need to know and understand what they are doing. Teach your kids to code."

As we enter this era of ubiquitous computing, how do we maintain privacy while benefiting from connected devices? The digital divide is shrinking, but are we teaching digital citizenship at the same pace?
