# TLDR 1

## Welcome to TL;DR

**Published**: June 27, 2015 • [[03 CREATE/📧 Newsletter/📧 Newsletter\|📧 Newsletter]]

*The very first issue - where it all began nearly a decade ago*

Thank you for being one of the first to sign up for my newsletter. In this weekly email, I'll pull together some of the content that I shared out throughout the week. It's basically things that I think you should know and discuss.

This week I traveled to Charleston to find a new home for my family. I also wrapped up the final week of the [ORMS MOOC](http://wiobyrne.com/join-the-orms-mooc/). I've been heavily involved in [revising my blog](http://wiobyrne.com/critique-construction-website/) and starting this newsletter. Finally, I got started in the [CLMOOC](https://plus.google.com/communities/111619469354411254407).

## 📖 What to Read

### [Americans' Internet Access: 2000-2015](http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/06/26/americans-internet-access-2000-2015/)

**Key takeaways**: The Internet is exploding in adoption. The digital divides based on race, ethnicity, and education appear to be shrinking. This Pew Research shows how internet access patterns evolved from 2000-2015.

### [Is Google listening to you?](http://www.psfk.com/2015/06/google-eavesdropping-tool-audio-snooping-code-privacy.html)

Another round of technopanic spreading through the Internet as the open source version of Chrome was found to have audio capture code. Further examination suggests Google made a mistake and is addressing it. **The key takeaway**: our devices are listening to us. We need to know and understand what they are doing. Teach your kids to code.

### [Sesame Street was the first MOOC?](https://www.edsurge.com/n/2015-06-09-the-original-mooc-can-sesame-street-replace-preschool)

Interesting debate here. University of Maryland and Wellesley College researchers show possible replacement of pre-school through viewing Sesame Street. The Brookings Institute calls Sesame Street the first MOOC. [Audrey Watters](http://hackeducation.com/2015/06/21/sesame-street-is-not-a-mooc-ffs/) and [Stephen Downes](http://www.downes.ca/cgi-bin/page.cgi?post=64063) quickly debunk that thinking.

### [Lexus finally gives us the Back to the Future hoverboard?](http://www.wired.com/2015/06/lexus-hoverboard-slide/)

I want to believe that before I die, these will finally be a reality.

### [Molson and Google team up to build a beer dispensing, language translating mini-fridge](http://techcrunch.com/2015/06/26/molson-and-google-built-a-beer-fridge-that-unlocks-via-voice-translation/)

This is really good...and really bad.

### [Boo at the Confederate flag til it burns](http://boingboing.net/2015/06/26/boo-at-the-confederate-flag-ti.html)

Interesting use of gaming and technology as activism and social commentary. Reminds me of [my Facebook Mood Survey response](http://wiobyrne.com/the-facepalm-social-mood-experiment/) from last year.

## 🛠️ Make of the Week

### [Make your own Raspberry Pi weather station](http://lifehacker.com/build-your-own-raspberry-pi-powered-weather-station-1697061082)

I shared out a link about a Kickstarter weather station using the incredible Raspberry Pi. It reminded me there are tons of possibilities to build your own weather station using cheap parts and a little bit of time.

## 🤔 Consider

This first issue captured themes that would define the newsletter for years to come: digital access equity, privacy concerns, educational technology debates, and maker culture. The voice was curious, skeptical of hype, and focused on empowering readers with knowledge.
