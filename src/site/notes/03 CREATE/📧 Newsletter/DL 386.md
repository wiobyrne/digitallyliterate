## Between Uncertainty and Well-being

Welcome to _Digitally Literate_, issue #386. This week, we reflect on uncertainty's role in resilience, the ethical dilemmas posed by AI, and the importance of knowledge systems.

---

## 🔖 Key Takeaways
- **Uncertainty**: Viewing ambiguity as an opportunity for growth and resilience rather than as a weakness.
- **AI and Ethics**: Navigating the potential impact of AI on human identity and empathy.
- **Knowledge Systems**: Learning from Martin Luther King Jr.'s organizational habits and leveraging archival tools for equitable access.

## 🌱 Embracing Uncertainty

Viewing uncertainty as a strength rather than a weakness fosters resilience and adaptability. Recent studies highlight how our response to uncertainty affects mental health:
- **Embracing Ambiguity**: Greater ease with uncertainty correlates with improved mental well-being. [Read more](https://www.nytimes.com/2024-01-13/opinion/uncertainty-anxiety-psychology.html).
- **Pandemic Lessons**: A pandemic study showed that tolerance of uncertainty helped individuals cope more effectively. [Examine](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/343409944_Coping_and_tolerance_of_uncertainty).
- **High-Stress Costs**: Those intolerant of uncertainty faced increased anxiety during challenging times. [Explore](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8608787/).

## 🤖 If There Were Gods

AI challenges human exceptionalism, forcing us to confront ethical questions about intelligence and empathy:
- Meghan O’Gieblyn in *God, Human, Animal, Machine* explores how humans define moral worth based on subjective experience. [Investigate](https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/23777171/ai-animals-rights-cruelty-transhumanism-bostrom).
- O’Gieblyn delves into how rising AI capabilities blur lines between machine and human traits. [Watch her discuss](https://archive.org/details/CSPAN2_20220224_104400_Meghan_OGieblyn_God_Human_Animal_Machine).

## 📖 In the Quiet Recesses

Martin Luther King Jr.'s meticulous note-taking and knowledge systems highlight the power of organized thought:
- King’s use of annotated margins and notecards shows his commitment to critical thinking and retaining insights. [Roam through his methods](https://jillianhess.substack.com/p/martin-luther-king-jrs-organizational).
- "Human beings were never designed for the poorly nourished, sedentary, socially-isolated pace of modern life." — Stephen Ilardi in *The Depression Cure*.

## 🧰 Use Archive Websites to Bypass Paywalls

For those unable to access subscription content, archival tools like the [Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/) or [Archive Today](https://archive.ph/) can provide alternate paths:
- Insert the URL into these tools to retrieve older versions of articles.
- These tools preserve web pages, often bypassing paywalls for older content.
