# TLDR 124

## Too Long; Didn't Read Issue 124

**Published**: 2017-11-18 • [[03 CREATE/📧 Newsletter/📧 Newsletter\|📧 Newsletter]]

Welcome to Issue 124. Some time well spent.

## 🔖 Key Takeaways

- **I Like the Ways**: I like the ways in which Natalia and Oliver have worked hard to blog about the book along the way. This video (and the shorter version) show a good understanding of how to make these materials more accessible and approachable.
- **I'm Sharing This**: I'm sharing this because it was an interesting precursor to what we're continuing to learn about the hack of the NSA by the Shadow Brokers in October.
- **You'll View World**: The book, and this post, give you an overview of the algorithms that rule, and most times ruin, our daily interactions. You'll view the world a bit differently after reading this text.
- **Take Some Time**: Take some time to read through this, and review your teaching practice.
- **I Love Website**: I love the website, YouTube channel, and social media connections. It all makes sense, and looks great.
- **I'm Moving to Greyscale**: I'm moving to greyscale for 30 days to see what impact this has on me...and my battery. Come join me in this experiment.

## 📚 Read

### [Security breach and spilled secrets have shaken the NSA to its core](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/12/us/nsa-shadow-brokers.html)

Last week I attended a talk by [Marina Kaljurand](https://twitter.com/MarinaKaljurand), the Chair of the [Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace](https://cyberstability.org/commissioners/marina-kaljurand/). Her talk focused on trust, privacy, and security. After the talk, I spent some time chatting with her about the role education factors into all of this, and she urged me to reach out to local black hat hackers to identify opportunities to embed some of these skills and mindsets into our classrooms.

I'm sharing this because it was an interesting precursor to what we're continuing to learn about the [hack of the NSA by the Shadow Brokers in October](https://www.axios.com/nsa-breach-reveals-spy-agencys-secret-weapons-2509043026.html).

What we're beginning to learn about these hacks should make us think quite deeply about our role in these digital spaces. Following the Snowden leaks, we began to understand more about our naive notions of privacy and security online. These leaks reach much further. [Read this excellent piece](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-11-13/an-nsa-breach-and-the-new-hobbesian-war-on-our-privacy) by [Eli Lake](https://twitter.com/EliLake).

### [The Ivory Tower can't keep ignoring tech](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/14/opinion/academia-tech-algorithms.html)

A great post by [Cathy O'Neil](https://twitter.com/mathbabedotorg) in the NY Times that provides some of the insight from her book, but specifically suited for academics. BTW, her book, [Weapons of Math Destruction](https://www.amazon.com/Weapons-Math-Destruction-Increases-Inequality/dp/0553418815), is excellent. I'm gifting it to friends this holiday season.

The book, and this post, give you an overview of the algorithms that rule, and most times ruin, our daily interactions. You'll view the world a bit differently after reading this text.

If you want to dig in a bit more with me, check out [this reading list](https://socialmediacollective.org/reading-lists/critical-algorithm-studies/) on critical literature on algorithms as social concerns.

### [Pedagogies of Dissent](https://www.cathydavidson.com/blog/pedagogies-of-dissent/)

Do you want to embed critical pedagogies in instruction? Want to use activist pedagogies to dig deep and teach critical texts?

[Cathy Davidson](https://twitter.com/CathyNDavidson) pulls all of this together in this post that compiles materials from active learning to engaged, student-centered, or radical pedagogies. She provides an overview of the theory and perspectives that frame this work, and then zooms in to look at pedagogy in action.

Take some time to read through this, and review your teaching practice.

### [Teaching students to legally use images online](https://www.cultofpedagogy.com/online-images/)

[Jennifer Gonzalez](https://twitter.com/cultofpedagogy) has been crushing it with the [Cult of Pedagogy website](https://www.cultofpedagogy.com/). I love the website, [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxEKnVOYnzM70yH7kDrU7bQ), and social media connections. It all makes sense, and looks great.

This post shares everything you need to know about adding images to your posts and content online. An invaluable resource for your work...and your classroom.

### [Ongoing reporting with gSuite](https://readwriterespond.com/2017/11/ongoing-reporting-with-gsuite/)

Trying to make sense of all of the ways in which Google Apps can be used in your daily work and processes?

[Aaron Davis](https://twitter.com/mrkrndvs) pulls everything together in this great overview of the different Googley tools and spaces...and how they can be integrated for specific purposes.

What I love about this post is that Aaron talks about specific things you might want to do...and concisely shares the links to make it happen. This post will most like serve as a final "checklist" of learning activities for some of my tech classes.

## 🔨 Do

### [Change your screen to grayscale to combat phone addiction](https://lifehacker.com/change-your-screen-to-grayscale-to-combat-phone-addicti-1795821843)

Your phone has a beautiful screen that displays apps, pictures, and content that stimulates your eyes and brain. Turn it off.

[Tristan Harris](https://twitter.com/tristanharris), former Googler and founder of the non-profit [Time Well Spent](http://www.timewellspent.io/) has been [talking recently](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/why-cant-we-put-down-our-smartphones-60-minutes/) about the ways in which our brains are hacked by these shiny spaces.

I'm moving to greyscale for 30 days to see what impact this has on me...and my battery. Come join me in this experiment. A quick Google search for your phone...and "grayscale" should give you the settings you'll need to make this happen.

## 🤔 Consider

> "The best way to achieve complete strategic surprise is to take an action that is either stupid or completely contrary to your self interest." — Robert Gates

This defense secretary's observation about strategic surprise applies eerily well to this week's themes: the NSA's security tools being stolen and weaponized against us, tech companies building addictive products that undermine their users' wellbeing, and academia ignoring algorithmic systems reshaping society. Sometimes what appears self-defeating is exactly what's happening—we're building systems contrary to our collective interests.

**🌱 Connected Concepts**:

- [[Digital Scholarship\|Digital Scholarship]] — The Digitally Agile Researcher demonstrates how editors blogged throughout production, created multiple video versions for accessibility, and modeled transparent scholarly process, showing how academic work can embrace digital affordances beyond traditional publishing while making research more approachable for diverse audiences.
- [[Cybersecurity and Privacy\|Cybersecurity and Privacy]] — NSA Shadow Brokers hack reveals consequences of hoarding security vulnerabilities as weapons: stolen NSA tools now weaponized against us all, extending far beyond Snowden revelations about surveillance to expose fundamental tensions in "nobody-but-us" security stance that makes everyone less safe when breached.
- [[Algorithmic Accountability\|Algorithmic Accountability]] — Cathy O'Neil's "Weapons of Math Destruction" argues ivory tower can no longer ignore tech as algorithms rule and ruin daily interactions, requiring academics to engage critical algorithm studies examining how automated decision systems encode bias, concentrate power, and demand interdisciplinary scrutiny from historians, philosophers, and social scientists.
- [[Critical Pedagogy Resources\|Critical Pedagogy Resources]] — Cathy Davidson compiles activist pedagogies from active learning to radical pedagogies, providing theory overview and pedagogy in action examples for embedding critical teaching that helps students dig deep into power structures, social justice, and transformative education challenging status quo.
- [[Attention Design\|Attention Design]] — Tristan Harris's Time Well Spent argues turning phones to grayscale combats addiction by removing stimulating colors that hack our brains, with 30-day experiment testing impact on usage and battery, recognizing that beautiful screens are designed to monopolize attention for platform profit rather than user wellbeing.
