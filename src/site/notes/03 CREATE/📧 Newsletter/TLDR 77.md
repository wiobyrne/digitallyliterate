** Too Long; Didn't Read (TL;DR) newsletter #77

------------------------------------------------------------

Welcome to issue 77 of the TL;DR Newsletter. In TL;DR we typically discuss events of the week in education, technology, and literacy. In this issue we take a look at process as opposed to product.

This week I worked on the following:

* Signal instant messenger (http://wiobyrne.com/imho/2016/signal) - I've been promising over the past month or two that I'd start documenting the steps that I'm taking to improve my privacy and security with digital tools. This post is the first in the series as I examine/install Signal. I suggest that you install and start to use Signal as well.

* Text disruption for youth disruptors (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cm_klzldoVDWeLlTZWOMzwQHhaAUGDhim3oewjjZ_xU/edit?usp=sharing) - This is a piece that I wrote with Susanne Murphy in which we're looking at the opportunities to use children's books as a teaching tool to discuss critical media literacies. I'm fine-tuning some of the elements of the submission and will send in for review within the next week. I'd love your comments if you've got the time.

## 📺 Watch

** This amazing girl mastered dubstep dancing by just using YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgzdDp5qfdI)

I just came across this video of 12 year old Adilyn Malcolm thanks to the algorithms on YouTube.

The video focuses on Adilyn using the internet to stop, rewind, and watch videos of the best dubstep dancers in the world. She documents what she learned in this powerful video.

## 📚 Read

If you hang out with educators at some point the term "grit" or "growth mindset" will come up. In this interview, Carol Dweck, the researcher that helped coin this term discusses the challenges of this perspective being "misappropriated" as we work with learners.

Specifically, I'm intrigued by her focus on praise, effort, and work process (as opposed to product):

A lot of parents or teachers say praise the effort, not the outcome. I say [that’s] wrong: Praise the effort that led to the outcome or learning progress; tie the praise to it. It’s not just effort, but strategy … so support the student in finding another strategy. Effective teachers who actually have classrooms full of children with a growth mindset are always supporting children’s learning strategies and showing how strategies created that success.

** Assessment is not a spreadsheet, it's a conversation (https://medium.com/learning-re-imagined/assessment-is-not-a-spreadsheet-its-a-conversation-3d743c754809#.d78lfjq0q)

A post from ** Graham Brown-Martin (https://twitter.com/GrahamBM)

in which he recounts a discussion with educator ** Joe Bower (https://twitter.com/joe_bower)

. Joe ** recently passed away (https://dianeravitch.net/2016/01/03/r-i-p-joe-bower/)

at the beginning of January.

This post from Brown-Martin shares some insight into discussions about education, assessment, and supporting learners. One of anecdotes will guide my work over the coming year:

Two young goldfish are swimming in the water, and they are swimming together and the come across an older goldfish. The older goldfish says to them, “Morning boys, how’s the water?” The two younger fish just keep swimming. Finally, one of the younger ones, after the old goldfish is long gone, turns to the other young one and says, “What the hell is water?” I think school is the water. We’ve been in it for so long, we don’t see it. We don’t even know it’s there. We’re on a form of autopilot where we just do it, but we can’t even describe it, because we’re so used to it.

** Three ways to create image-based formative assessments (http://www.freetech4teachers.com/2016/12/three-ways-to-create-image-based.html)

In my classes and talks I indicate that it is imperative that educators and students know how to create and use screencaptures and screencasts. This post from Richard Byrne takes this a step further and shows a couple tools that can be used to turn these images/videos into formative assessments.

Think about the possibilities as you annotate an image from your computer screen. Think about the questions you can ask students about this content. Byrne shares a couple tools (** Formative (http://goformative.com/)

, ** Wizer (http://app.wizer.me/)

, ** Google Forms (http://forms.google.com/)

) that can be used to create an assessment item from this image.

** The digital research process visually explained (http://www.educatorstechnology.com/2016/12/the-digital-research-process-visually.html)

An infographic that focused on the digital tools and process involved in conducting research online. This infographic is helpful as it details not only the steps involved in the research process, but some of the tools that can be used in this work.

I'll share this with students in my classes as they develop technology embedded lesson/unit plans.

** Why time management is ruining our lives (https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/22/why-time-management-is-ruining-our-lives)

In a lot of my work I indicate opportunities to improve productivity or integrate digitally agile perspectives into our work processes. This long reading post from The Guardian is a good reality check to ensure that we really do want to head down this path of hyper-productivity.

## 🔨 Do

** Bread class (http://www.instructables.com/class/Bread-Class/)

I'm sharing this class from ** Instructables (http://www.instructables.com/)

for two reasons.

First, I love experimenting with dough to make great bread and even better pizza dough.

Second, I enjoy the way that they organize the materials for the class. They have you sign in to access the materials. It is also well organized into a series of modules and things that you can make in a short period of time. I'll be mimicking this format soon. :)

## 🤔 Consider

The learning process is something you can incite, literally incite, like a riot.
