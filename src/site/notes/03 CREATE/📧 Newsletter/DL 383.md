## Navigating Paradoxes

Welcome to _Digitally Literate_, issue #383. This week we explore the paradoxes of innovation, internet culture, and the narratives that shape our lives.

## 🔖 Key Takeaways
- **Digital Civility**: Substack faces criticism for lax content moderation, prompting discussions about platform ethics.
- **Innovation Resistance**: It’s time to challenge the idea that technological progress must always be accepted without question.
- **Internet Culture**: The internet is becoming weirder and more human-scale, sparking renewed creativity.
- **Life’s S-Curves**: Embrace life's nonlinear journey and focus efforts intentionally.

## 🚩 Not Hanging Around The Nazi Bar

Substack is under fire for its lack of content moderation:
- **Extremist Content**: The platform allows white supremacist and anti-Semitic content as long as it doesn’t incite violence. [Learn more](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/11/substack-extremism-nazi-white-supremacy-newsletters/676156/).
- **Community Reactions**: Writers like [Laura Hilliger](https://www.laurahilliger.com/) and [Audrey Watters](https://2ndbreakfast.audreywatters.com/leaving-substack-again/) are re-evaluating their use of Substack. Check out [Ben Werdmuller's perspective](https://werd.io/2023/leaving-the-nazi-bar).

For now, I’m pausing my Substack postings.
