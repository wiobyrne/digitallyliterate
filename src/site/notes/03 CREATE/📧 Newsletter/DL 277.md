## We Lost Control of Our Faces

**Published**: February 6, 2021 • [[03 CREATE/📧 Newsletter/📧 Newsletter\|📧 Newsletter]]

Welcome to *Digitally Literate*, issue 277. Your go-to source for insightful content on education, technology, and the digital landscape.

## 🔖 Key Takeaways
- **Location Data Exposed Rioters**: Times researchers identified Capitol mob members from leaked smartphone location data despite carrier anonymity claims
- **43 Years of Lost Consent**: Researchers examined 130+ facial recognition datasets and found consent was gradually abandoned as deep learning demanded more data
- **Mothers at Breaking Point**: Eleven months, multiple breakdowns—pandemic parenting pushed mothers to the brink with no support
- **Deplatforming Is Accountability**: Claiming that banning racists violates the First Amendment shows a distorted understanding of how speech and power work online
- **Math for Liberation**: Social justice education isn't limited to humanities—Teaching Tolerance became Learning for Justice

Welcome back all.

This week I posted the following:

- [Where I'm From](https://walkmy.world/start-walking/walk2021/le3/) - Learning Event #3 - Consider your own culture and where you've been. How are these people, values, practices, and places a part of you?
- [Narrative for Tenure & Promotion](https://wiobyrne.com/narrative/) - Sharing the Narrative for my Tenure and Promotion materials in an attempt to promote open scholarship.
- [Leadership Roles, Skills, and You](https://wiobyrne.com/leadership-roles-skills-and-you/) - I have been researching leadership to better understand the qualities and interactions that go into creating a worthwhile leader.
- [Remembering in Digital Contexts](https://wiobyrne.com/remembering-in-digital-contexts/) - The life of the dead is placed in the memory of the living. – Marcus Tullius Cicero

## 📺 Watch

### [Huxley's Vision of Conditioned Servitude](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huxley-brave-new-world)

Aldous Huxley foresaw a Central State that persuaded its people to "love their servitude" via propaganda, drugs, entertainment, and information-overload. In his view, the energy required to force compliance exceeded the "cost" of persuasion—thus the Powers That Be would opt for the power of suggestion.

As prescient as he was, Huxley could not have foreseen the power of electronic media hypnosis as a conditioning mechanism for passivity and self-absorption. We are only beginning to understand the immense conditioning powers of 24/7 social and news media. His warning resonates as we lose control of our faces, our locations, and our attention.

### [How Smartphone Location Data Revealed the Capitol Mob](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/05/opinion/capitol-attack-cellphone-data.html)

Times researchers [Charlie Warzel](https://twitter.com/cwarzel) and [Stuart A. Thompson](https://twitter.com/stuartathompson) were able to identify individuals from a trove of leaked smartphone location data.

Key to bringing the mob to justice has been the event's digital detritus: location data, geotagged photos, facial recognition, surveillance cameras, and crowdsourcing.

> This is the second time these reporters have received this kind of information. Both times, they have demonstrated that it is far from anonymous, despite carrier claims. Collection and use of this data REALLY needs to be better regulated. - [@Iwillleavenow](https://twitter.com/Iwillleavenow/status/1357702171219816449)

The data that tracked insurrectionists is the same data that tracks everyone. Today's crisis doesn't justify tomorrow's surveillance.

### [This Is How We Lost Control of Our Faces](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/02/05/1017388/ai-deep-learning-facial-recognition-data-history/)

[Deborah Raji](https://twitter.com/rajiinio), a fellow at nonprofit Mozilla, and [Genevieve Fried](https://www.techcongress.io/genevieve-fried), who advises members of Congress on algorithmic accountability, examined over 130 facial-recognition datasets compiled over 43 years.

They found that researchers, driven by the exploding data requirements of deep learning, gradually abandoned asking for people's consent. This has led more and more personal photos to be incorporated into systems of surveillance without knowledge.

Read the report: [About Face: A Survey of Facial Recognition Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.00813.pdf).

The erosion happened incrementally—each dataset slightly less careful about consent than the last, until we arrived at a world where our faces train systems we never agreed to.

### [Three American Mothers on the Brink](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/02/04/parenting/covid-pandemic-mothers-primal-scream.html)

Eleven months, multiple breakdowns, one harrowing realization: They've got to get back up and do it all again tomorrow.

This piece captures the invisible labor that has collapsed onto mothers during the pandemic—the impossible math of work, childcare, and emotional support with no relief in sight. The systems that should have helped were never there.

### [Banning White Supremacy Isn't Censorship, It's Accountability](https://www.wired.com/story/banning-white-supremacy-censorship-accountability/)

In an [earlier issue of DL](https://digitallyliterate.net/dl-275/), I shared thinking about freedom of speech and digital spaces by [malkia devich-cyril](https://twitter.com/culturejedi). Here, devich-cyril expands on this thinking.

Claiming that deplatforming racists violates First Amendment rights shows a distorted understanding of how speech, race, and power work online. The First Amendment protects against government censorship—not the consequences of private platform policies.

[Margaret Sullivan](https://twitter.com/Sulliview) adds: [This is not cancel culture, this is accountability](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/media/cancel-culture-criticism-accountability/2021/01/29/8d24d2d4-6180-11eb-9061-07abcc1f9229_story.html).

### [Mathematics in Context: The Pedagogy of Liberation](https://www.learningforjustice.org/magazine/spring-2021/mathematics-in-context-the-pedagogy-of-liberation)

Teaching Tolerance [changes its name to Learning for Justice](https://www.splcenter.org/news/2021/02/03/learning-justice-teaching-tolerance-changes-its-name-reflect-evolving-work-struggle-radical) to reflect evolving work in the struggle for radical change in education and community.

Social justice education isn't limited to humanities courses. In this post, two math educators explain how their commitment to equity informs the way they teach. Math can be a tool for liberation or a gatekeeper—the pedagogy determines which.

## 🔨 Do

### [Switch to Joplin for Note-Taking](https://joplinapp.org/)

I'm in the process of switching up my toolkit. Part of this involves finally shutting down my Evernote account and moving to something open source.

I've been testing out [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/)...and loving it. In fact, I've been using it to write this newsletter over the last couple of months.

Open source, markdown-based, end-to-end encrypted sync options. I'll discuss more in upcoming posts.

## 🤔 Consider

### Everyone sees what you appear to be, few experience what you really are.

*Niccolò Machiavelli*

Machiavelli's observation about appearance versus reality connects to this issue's threads—facial recognition systems trained on our appearances without consent, location data revealing our movements to anyone who buys it, and the gap between how we present online and who we actually are. We've lost control of our faces, and with them, control of our narratives.
