# TLDR 136

## Too Long; Didn't Read Issue 136

**Published**: 2018-02-10 • [[03 CREATE/📧 Newsletter/📧 Newsletter\|📧 Newsletter]]

Welcome to Issue #136. What a long, strange trip it's been.

This week I posted the following:
- [Eight steps to write a literature review](http://wiobyrne.com/literature-review/) - I'm starting up several new research projects. I'm also busy bringing a new graduate assistant up to speed to talk about the research process. I'm documenting all of this on my website...something I should have done years ago.
- [Negotiating the positive & negative as a citizen of the world](http://wiobyrne.com/citizen-of-the-world/) - A post providing some guidance from Stoic philosophies on how to deal with positive and negative people.
- [Shape of my story](https://medium.com/rps-2k18/shape-of-my-story-6996a11a4652) - This post is the fifth learning event for my slam poetry class. We're studying the general shape involved in storytelling before we focus on telling our stories.
- Video: [Using Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework in the classroom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oD9eBHB81o)

Please [subscribe](http://wiobyrne.us11.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=7b5ee323a16720dad25ff96ff&id=17e92a2ae1) to make sure this comes to your inbox each week.

## 🔖 Key Takeaways

- **Space Nerd Loves Launches**: As I've stated several times here in TL;DR, I'm a space nerd. I also love having the opportunity to sit back and watch these launches via YouTube with my children.
- **Digital Residue Shared Daily**: Something to think about as we share this digital residue in our daily interactions. The GPS tracking company Strava released heat maps revealing the location and movements of soldiers as they exercised overseas in conflict zones.
- **Three Reasons for Shift**: The research presents three reasons for this shift: the rise of neoliberalism, increasingly anxious and controlling parents, and the increasing power of meritocracy.
- **Different Types Digital Support**: In the same way that different teenagers need different types of social support from their parents, they need different types of digital support, as well.
- **Should Begin Elementary School**: Buchanan suggests this should begin in the two final years of primary or elementary school.
- **Root Is Personal Insecurity**: Workers and leaders in organizations are overworked, and burn out due to a complex combination of factors involving our profession, our organization, and ourselves. The root of this all is personal insecurity.

## 📺 Watch

### [Falcon Heavy test flight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbSwFU6tY1c)

This week, [Space X](http://www.spacex.com/) test launched the [Falcon Heavy](http://www.spacex.com/falcon-heavy), the most powerful operational rocket in the world by a factor of two. With the ability to lift into orbit nearly 64 metric tons (141,000 lb)---a mass greater than a 737 jetliner loaded with passengers, crew, luggage and fuel--Falcon Heavy can lift more than twice the payload of the next closest operational vehicle, the Delta IV Heavy, at one-third the cost.

As I've stated several times here in TL;DR, I'm a space nerd. I also love having the opportunity to sit back and watch these launches via YouTube with my children. The broadcasts are informative, and carry a lot of slick digital eye candy. The end result is enjoyable, and hopefully builds budding scientists.

### [If you can't take the heat map: Benefits & risks of releasing location datasets](https://fpf.org/2018/01/31/if-you-cant-take-the-heat-map-benefits-risks-of-releasing-location-datasets/)

Last week [the Washington Post reported](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/a-map-showing-the-users-of-fitness-devices-lets-the-world-see-where-us-soldiers-are-and-what-they-are-doing/2018/01/28/86915662-0441-11e8-aa61-f3391373867e_story.html?utm_term=.90569d9274ec) on a serious problem that is appearing as we track our interactions throughout the day.

The GPS tracking company, [Strava, released heat maps](https://labs.strava.com/heatmap/#2.95/59.86091/47.61165/hot/all) in which they used satellite information to map the locations and movements of users of their service. This means that individuals that were using Fitbits, Jawbones, and other location tracking tools were having their location and movements tracked and exposed in this global heat map.

The problem is that these maps revealed the location and movements of soldiers as they exercised overseas in conflict zones. This puts their location and actions at risk.

Something to think about as we share this digital residue in our daily interactions.

### [The irrational desire driving millennials and Gen Z into depression](https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/irrational-desire-driving-millennials-gen-z-depression-222357005.html)

An important thread has been emerging in the research, and online discussion that you need to know more about. The first part of this thread focuses on youth and their obsession with perfection. According [this study from the Psychological Bulletin](http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/bul-bul0000138.pdf), the current generation is more obsessed with this than previous generations. This trend is associated with increased depression and anxiety.

The research suggests there are multiple dimensions to this cultural phenomenon. These could range from self-oriented perfectionism (the pressure one puts on oneself to be perfect), socially prescribed perfectionism (the pressure one feels from society to be perfect), and other-oriented perfectionism (the pressure one puts on others to be perfect).

The research presents three reasons for this shift: the rise of neoliberalism, increasingly anxious and controlling parents, and the increasing power of meritocracy.

We need to think about the role of media and cultural texts and their role in propagating these trends. Which brings us to the second part of this picture...

### [Social media and teen anxiety](https://www.gse.harvard.edu/news/uk/17/12/social-media-and-teen-anxiety)

The second part of this picture I see developing focuses on the role of social media in our interactions. In recent issues of TL;DR, we've discussed the increasing acceptance of social media platforms to admit that these products and spaces may be bad for us. I think we're slowly starting to recognize the negative impact on our children.

This post from [Leah Shafer](https://twitter.com/leahjshafer) in outlines research on how parents can help kids navigate the pressures of their digital lives without ignoring the positives.

Shafer weaves together multiple research reports with interview data to suggest that we're witnessing a link between social media and mental health concerns. Shafer posits, "In the same way that different teenagers need different types of social support from their parents, they need different types of digital support, as well. If your teen seems irritable or overwhelmed by social media, pay attention to what specifically is causing those feelings."

As we discuss the role of depression and coping strategies in youth, we sometimes hear this narrative that they are [snowflakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowflake_(slang)) that are entitled, or have an inflated, weak sense of their own entitlement. I think we need to think deeply about how well we're adjusting to these new digital, social streams. Adults also need to be honest and examine our practices as well.

### [How to help children build a positive presence online](https://theconversation.com/why-children-should-be-taught-to-build-a-positive-online-presence-89855)

One of the challenges in our discussions about the possible negative impact of these digital, social spaces on our lives is the understanding that the Internet is the dominant text of our generation. You need to be online, and know how to leverage these spaces...or you cannot effectively participate in society (IMHO).

This post from [Rachel Buchanan](https://theconversation.com/why-children-should-be-taught-to-build-a-positive-online-presence-89855) in [The Conversation](https://theconversation.com/us) shares guidance on what is a digital footprint, how to explain it to youth, and an understanding of when should you start to begin these discussions. You'll be surprised by the findings. Buchanan suggests this should begin in the two final years of primary or elementary school. She suggests:

- they are lacking this information and were not aware a digital footprint could be a positive asset for their future;
- children at this age are transitioning from predominantly game playing and video watching to more creative and generative uses of the internet and social media;
- different parenting styles means not all children will get this information at home;
- the strength of the cyber safety message they're getting from schools suggests this knowledge could be built upon so children are given options about which online activities should remain invisible and which would be beneficial to have out there.

### [If you're so successful, why are you still working 70 hours per week?](https://hbr.org/2018/02/if-youre-so-successful-why-are-you-still-working-70-hours-a-week)

As we begin our careers, we're given this narrative that if we get ourselves in the door, we can work hard and be rewarded by employers. The narrative continues that we are rewarded with a series of increasingly senior positions, and the security of tenure. One of the only factors in this was how hard you wanted to work. How many hours would you put in at the beginning?

Research from over 500 interviews is shared in a [new book](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/leading-professionals-9780198744788?cc=us&lang=en&) from [Laura Empson](https://www.cass.city.ac.uk/faculties-and-research/experts/laura-empson) that suggests that this narrative may longer be true. Workers and leaders in organizations are overworked, and burn out due to a complex combination of factors involving our profession, our organization, and ourselves. The root of this all is personal insecurity.

How hard are you working? Why are you working this hard? Do you feel that you are doing a good job? Do you feel valued? How do you measure these elements?
