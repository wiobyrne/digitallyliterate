## Machine Learning Delay

**Published**: February 1, 2020 • [[03 CREATE/📧 Newsletter/📧 Newsletter\|📧 Newsletter]]

Welcome to *Digitally Literate*, issue 231. Your go-to source for insightful content on education, technology, and the digital landscape.

## 🔖 Key Takeaways
- **Machine Learning Creates New Sounds**: Google's NSynth neural synthesizer generates hybrid instruments like "cat flutes" and "beast guitars" by learning relationships between different sound sources
- **Off-Facebook Activity Tool Arrives**: Facebook's new transparency feature lets users see and clear third-party tracking data—a first step toward user control over data collection
- **Teen Sleep Research Shows Measurement Bias**: Orben and Przybylski find negative tech-sleep associations are mainly driven by retrospective self-reports rather than time-use diaries
- **Facial Recognition Bans Needed**: Max Read pushes back against fatalism that surveillance tech is inevitable—laws can and should control technology
- **OER Friction Reduction**: Lumen Learning adds Google Doc links to webpages for friction-free community feedback on open educational resources

[Last week I posted this piece](https://wiobyrne.com/talking-to-youth-about-privacy-security-digital-spaces/) about talking to youth about privacy, security, & digital spaces. These materials and the related interview were used by [Meghan Herbst](https://www.meghanherbst.com/) in a piece for Wired on [How to Raise Media-Savvy Kids in the Digital Age](https://www.wired.com/story/kids-digital-media-literacy-tips/).

If you haven't already, please [subscribe](https://digitallyliterate.net/subscribe/) if you would like this newsletter to show up in your inbox. Feel free to reach out and let me know what you think of this work at [hello@digitallyliterate.net](mailto:hello@digitallyliterate.net).

### [How Machine Learning Is Generating Strange, New Sounds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOoSy-Pg8is)

[Project Magenta](https://research.google/teams/brain/magenta/) is a Google Research project that uses machine learning to create new tools for artists and musicians. One of these tools is [NSynth](https://nsynthsuper.withgoogle.com/), a neural synthesizer that generates strange, new sounds like "cat flutes," "beast guitars," and "screaming 3D printers."

In this video from [Nat and Friends](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCf4AIjSwE-E2TggCPdm-z-A), they explore how NSynth works, and talk with Andrew Huang about his [process creating a song](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?q=https://goo.gl/9Ykq5H&redir_token=PZWAI9L4BLDu_Qfy41wtE_BbKpN8MTU4MDY1NzUyMUAxNTgwNTcxMTIx&event=video_description&v=BOoSy-Pg8is) entirely out of NSynth generated sounds.

What makes NSynth fascinating is how it learns the characteristics of different sounds and creates entirely new hybrid instruments—not just mixing audio but generating something genuinely novel.

### [How to Change Your Off-Facebook Activity Settings](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/01/how-change-your-facebook-activity-settings)

[Facebook's long-awaited](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/facebook-privacy-optics-clear-history-zuckerberg) [Off-Facebook Activity tool started rolling out](https://about.fb.com/news/2019/08/off-facebook-activity/) this week.

[While it's not a perfect measure](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/01/facebook-history-welcome-incomplete-move), and we still need stronger data privacy laws, this tool is a first step toward greater transparency and user control regarding third-party tracking. Hopefully other companies follow suit, and allow users to take advantage of it.

[This tutorial](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/01/how-change-your-facebook-activity-settings) shows you how to clear your account of off-Facebook activity, and prevent it from being collected in the future. The tool reveals how extensively your browsing and app usage is tracked across the web.

### [Teenage Sleep and Technology Engagement Across the Week](https://peerj.com/articles/8427/)

[Amy Orben](https://www.amyorben.com/) and [Andrew Przybylski](https://www.przybylski.xyz/) analyze data from 11,884 adolescents in the UK Millennium Cohort Study to examine the association between digital engagement and adolescent sleep. They compare the relative effects of retrospective self-report vs. time-use diary measures of technology use.

Results suggest that negative associations are mainly driven by retrospective technology use measures and measures of total time spent on digital devices during the day—not by more accurate time-use diaries.

This methodological insight is crucial: how we measure technology use significantly shapes what correlations we find, adding important nuance to screentime debates.

### [Why We Should Ban Facial Recognition Technology](http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/01/why-we-should-ban-facial-recognition-technology.html)

[There has been a lot of news about Clearview AI](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/18/technology/clearview-privacy-facial-recognition.html), a shadowy facial-recognition-software company providing users access to a database of 3 billion photographs scraped from social media and video streaming sites.

Max Read takes issue with a quote from one of Clearview's investors: "I've come to the conclusion that because information constantly increases, there's never going to be privacy…Laws have to determine what's legal, but you can't ban technology."

Read pushes back on this narrative that the creep of new technologies is inevitable and attempts to stop or control it is foolish. Society bans and regulates technologies all the time—the question is political will, not technical possibility.

### [A De-escalation Exercise for Upset Students](https://www.edutopia.org/article/de-escalation-exercise-upset-students)

A simple technique that takes just a few minutes can help an agitated student regain the state of mind needed for learning:

- Give the student time to regain their calm
- Direct the student to be aware of their thoughts and feelings
- Have the student redirect their thoughts
- Give the student positive feedback on becoming calm
- Give the student a little more time to refocus
- Have the student reflect for the future

These steps acknowledge that emotional regulation is a prerequisite for learning and that explicit instruction in calming techniques supports student success.

## 🔨 Do

### [Reducing Friction in the Development of Your OER](https://opencontent.org/blog/archives/6282)

I blog a lot and share materials openly online. As I build and share materials, I'm always trying to find ways to allow people to respond and critique my materials in a friction-free manner.

In this post from [David Wiley](https://davidwiley.org/), he indicates that at [Lumen Learning](http://lumenlearning.com/) they are adding a button to the bottom of all webpages that links to a Google Doc version of the content. This is shared publicly, and has Track Changes turned on to allow feedback.

I may add this to my blogging and publishing repertoire—lowering barriers to contribution is how open content improves.

## 🤔 Consider

### I'm reflective only in the sense that I learn to move forward. I reflect with a purpose.

*Kobe Bryant*

Bryant's words—shared just days before his tragic death—connect to this issue's themes of purposeful iteration. Whether it's machine learning systems improving through training data or educators reducing friction for feedback on OER, reflection without forward motion is incomplete.
