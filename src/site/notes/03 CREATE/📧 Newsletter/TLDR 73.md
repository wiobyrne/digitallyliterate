## 🔖 Key Takeaways

- **I'll Often Play These**: I love the videos from Ok Go. The music is catchy, but their videos are amazing mixtures of physics, technology, and expression. I'll often play these as we come back from a break in class, or a workshop.
- **IMHO, the Biggest Challenge**: These results are by no means new or startling. In my dissertation I studied critical evaluation of online information. Adults rarely critically interrogate what they read online as well. IMHO, the biggest challenge comes in health care as individuals have been shown to "just Google it" and use that information to deal with health maladies as opposed to consulting a physician.
- **Little Did I Know**: In my dissertation, I had students create fake websites with the thinking that this would be a way for them to examine the strategies used in developing online materials. Little did I know this could be a lucrative endeavor. ;)
- **If I Were to Do My Dissertation**: As a researcher that studies literacies in new and digital spaces, this is fascinating. If I were to do my dissertation all over again, I'd have students study and recreate misinformation in the classroom. This in turn would be used to fuel discussions about how "useful" and "truthful" is the information that we read online.
- **This Is Something for Us All**: Along with this our notions of privacy and security as we read, write, and participate online quickly vanish. Furthermore, this should not be viewed as a case of "you shouldn't worry if you have nothing to hide." It should also not be viewed as only an event in other countries. This is something for us all to discuss as the web is a networked space in which we all coexist.

### [The One Moment - by Ok Go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvW61K2s0tA)

I love the videos from [Ok Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OK_Go). The music is catchy, but their [videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/OkGo) are amazing mixtures of physics, technology, and expression. I'll often play these as we come back from a break in class, or a workshop.

This latest video is from the song The One Moment. You can see the ["behind the scenes" video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dFdNUz2cQc).

## 📚 Read

### [Most students don't know when news is fake, Stanford study finds](http://www.wsj.com/articles/most-students-dont-know-when-news-is-fake-stanford-study-finds-1479752576)

This piece reports on [results from a study](https://sheg.stanford.edu/upload/V3LessonPlans/Executive%20Summary%2011.21.16.pdf) conducted by the History Education Group at Stanford. This work examined 7,804 responses from students across various levels (middle/high/higher ed) on 56 tasks across 12 states in the U.S. The results describe young people's ability to reason about the information on the internet as being "bleak."

These results are by no means new or startling. In [my dissertation](http://wiobyrne.com/dissertation/) I studied critical evaluation of online information. In the theory section you can read up on how students do not critically evaluate the materials they read online. Adults rarely critically interrogate what they read online as well. IMHO, the biggest challenge comes in health care as individuals have been shown to "just Google it" and use that information to deal with health maladies as opposed to consulting a physician.

My focus has been on (as I detailed in last week's TL;DR) developing our health skepticism as we consume all media...especially as we read online.

### [We tracked down a fake-news creator in the suburbs. Here's what we learned.](http://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2016/11/23/503146770/npr-finds-the-head-of-a-covert-fake-news-operation-in-the-suburbs)

A post from [All Tech Considered](http://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/) on [NPR](http://www.npr.org/) in which they investigate and track down one of these supposed producers of "fake news" online. What follows is an interesting look at the digital bread crumbs that you leave behind even when you don't want to be found online.

What strikes me about this is the large audience and amount of money that can be gained by targeting specific groups.

In my dissertation, I had students create fake websites with the thinking that this would be a way for them to examine the strategies used in developing online materials. Little did I know this could be a lucrative endeavor. ;)

### [Russian propaganda effort helped spread 'fake news' during election, experts say](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/russian-propaganda-effort-helped-spread-fake-news-during-election-experts-say/2016/11/24/793903b6-8a40-4ca9-b712-716af66098fe_story.html)

Post from The Washington Post trying to connect the dots between the massive amount of fake news available online during the U.S. election and possible Russian connections. The article discusses an "increasingly sophisticated propaganda machinery" consisting of botnets, paid human "trolls" and social media accounts. The article continues as they detail the origins and possible motivations of this work.

As a researcher that studies literacies in new and digital spaces, this is fascinating. If I were to do my dissertation all over again, I'd have students study and recreate misinformation in the classroom. This in turn would be used to fuel discussions about how "useful" and "truthful" is the information that we read online.

As a web literate individual that seeks to empower and advocate for others, I think this spells out a very real future in which we'll need propaganda created and disseminated on all sides. Depending on your perspectives, if you do not agree with some of this news and label it as "fake," perhaps there is a need to have groups creating an equal and opposite news stream on the other side of the spectrum.

### [New report shows the reach of online harassment, digital abuse, and cyberstalking](http://datasociety.net/blog/2016/11/21/online-harassment/)

A new report from the [Data & Society Research Institute](http://datasociety.net/) and the [Center for Innovative Public Health Research](http://innovativepublichealth.org/). The report, titled [Online Harassment, Digital Abuse, and Cyberstalking](http://www.datasociety.net/pubs/oh/Online_Harassment_2016.pdf) presents a look into the unwanted contact that is often used to intimidate, annoy, and frighten individuals using digital tools.

Some of the findings include:

- 47% of internet users have personally experienced online harassment or abuse.
- More than a quarter of Americans (27%) have refrained from posting or saying something online out of fear of harassment.
- Men and women equally likely to face harassment, but women experience a wider variety of online abuse, including more serious violations.

I recommend reviewing the full report to understand the complexity of these findings.

### [Snooper's Charter is set to become law: how the Investigatory Powers Bill will affect you](http://www.wired.co.uk/article/ip-bill-law-details-passed)

We have a good number of TL;DR readers from around the globe, and I'd be remiss if I didn't include the recent news of the Investigatory Powers Bill, or as it is sometimes called, the Snooper's Charter. This sweeping legislation calls for internet service providers (ISPs) to keep a full record of every site that customers have visited. This information is then made available to a wide range of government bodies if asked.

We see a growing trend of these battles between privacy and surveillance springing up around the globe. Along with this our notions of privacy and security as we read, write, and participate online quickly vanish. Furthermore, this should not be viewed as a case of "you shouldn't worry if you have nothing to hide." It should also not be viewed as only an event in other countries. This is something for us all to discuss as the web is a networked space in which we all coexist.

### [Inspiring young writers with Minecraft](https://www.edutopia.org/article/inspiring-young-writers-with-minecraft-matthew-farber)

A great piece by [Matthew Farber](https://twitter.com/matthewfarber) on [Edutopia](https://www.edutopia.org/) discussing possibilities for [Minecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft) and building literacy skills and practices.

Specifically, Matthew looks at the use of Minecraft themed books to build independence in interest-driven reading. He also looks at the potential as a toolkit for aspiring authors and making writing relevant.

Check out the [teaching materials](http://markcheverton.com/resources-for-teachers/) submitted by Mark Cheverton and most of all the guide on [writing Minecraft stories for kids](http://markcheverton.com/wp-content/uploads/downloads/2016/06/Writing-Your-Minecraft-Story-for-Teachers.pdf).

## 🤔 Consider

> "Responsibility to yourself means refusing to let others do your thinking, talking, and naming for you; it means learning to respect and use your own brains and instincts; hence, grappling with hard work." — Adrienne Rich
