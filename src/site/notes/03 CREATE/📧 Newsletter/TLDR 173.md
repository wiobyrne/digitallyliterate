### Media Literacy Curriculum Needs

Schools need to supply students with skills for productive informed membership in society. As society evolves curriculum must evolve. Schools partly recognized this incorporating [computer science classes](https://news.gallup.com/poll/196511/computer-science-classes-teach-programming-coding.aspx) but we need to go further instructing youth how to properly consume and disseminate online information.

Support movements: [Media Literacy Now](https://medialiteracynow.org/) and [Digital Citizenship Institute](http://digcitinstitute.com/).

### [What the Times Got Wrong About Kids and Phones](https://www.cjr.org/criticism/times-silicon-valley-kids.php)

[Anya Kamenetz](https://twitter.com/anya1anya) dissects NY Times posts from last week. Also recommend [The Backlash Against Screen Time at School](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2018/11/screen-time-backlash/567934/) from The Atlantic.

### [What Is White Privilege, Really?](https://www.tolerance.org/magazine/fall-2018/what-is-white-privilege-really)

I've been on journey learning more about racism white privilege and white fragility.

White privilege fallen victim to own connotations. Double whammy inspiring pushback: 1) "white" [creates discomfort among those not used to being defined by race](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/13/magazine/white-people-are-noticing-something-new-their-own-whiteness.html). 2) "privilege" especially for poor and rural white people sounds like word suggesting they never struggled.

### [Is the Era of Voice Texting Upon Us?](https://www.theringer.com/tech/2018/11/5/18056776/voice-texting-whatsapp-apple-2018)

Lately spending more time using voice typing on mobile keyboard. Android option to send voice message opposed to text. Been wondering why send short voice clips opposed to just call. Apparently lots of people. Might check out [Wire](https://wire.com/en/).

### [Drawing Is Fastest Most Effective Way to Learn](https://www.inc.com/jessica-stillman/drawing-is-fastest-most-effective-way-to-learn-according-to-new-research.html)

[Researchers](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0963721418755385) hypothesize drawing provides brain many different ways to engage with new material. You figure out how to draw it imagining detail in mind experience physical feeling rendering idea then look at visual representation.

### Stress Management Strategies

This week stressed about couple things. Hoping learned lessons won't forget or repeat. This post shares good strategies for managing dealing with stress.

## 🤔 Consider

> "I am larger, better than I thought; I did not know I held so much goodness. All seems beautiful to me. Whoever denies me, it shall not trouble me; Whoever accepts me, he or she shall be blessed, and shall bless me." — Walt Whitman

Whitman's self-discovery resonates with returning after absence finding yourself larger than remembered. Media literacy revealing we're capable of more critical thinking than curriculum assumes. Screentime critique showing we contain more nuance than panic narratives allow. White privilege journey discovering complexity within ourselves we didn't know existed. Voice texting finding new communication modes within us. Drawing for learning realizing visual thinking capacity we hadn't accessed. Stress management revealing resilience we possess. Return from absence often means rediscovering capacities that were always there waiting to be recognized.
