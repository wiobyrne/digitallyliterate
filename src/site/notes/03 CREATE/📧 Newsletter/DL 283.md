Welcome back. This week I was tenured and promoted...and then bought a house. Oh...and I got the first shot of the COVID vaccine. Upgrades!!! :)

This week I also posted the following:

- [Our Magnum Opus](https://walkmy.world/start-walking/walk2021/le8/) - Learning Event #8 - The World Is Yours. What will you do with it?
- [Writing Myself Into Existence](https://wiobyrne.com/writing-myself-into-existence/) - Changes I'll make in my blogging focus as I near the end of the [#100daystooffload challenge](https://100daystooffload.com/).

- [Toward an Internet Bill of Rights](https://wiobyrne.com/internet-bill-of-rights/) - Given recent events surrounding rights and freedoms online, I'm reaching out to develop an Internet Bill of Rights.

## 📺 Watch

### [The Gift - Short Film](https://vimeo.com/the-gift)

The Gift is the story of an ordinary couple. When he gives her a small sphere pulled from his chest, she can't separate herself from her new gift—even after they break up.

A meditation on attachment, gifts, and what we carry from relationships.

## 📚 Read

### [After Georgia Attacks, Asian-Americans Demand Serious Action on Bias](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/18/us/asian-bias-atlanta-shooting.html)

Amid the pandemic, Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) people continue to experience racism, violence, and harassment.

Resources for recognizing and speaking up against coronavirus racism, and starting conversations with even the youngest learners about recognizing and acting to address injustice.

### [What Happens When a Slogan Becomes the Curriculum](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/03/should-black-lives-matter-agenda-be-taught-school/618277/)

A curriculum inspired by the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement is spreading, raising questions about the line between education and indoctrination.

The BLM at School movement draws on academic perspectives like critical race theory and intersectionality; rejects individualism and aspirational color-blindness; and acts in solidarity with projects including decoloniality, anti-capitalism, and queer liberation.

While curricula and teachers will always warrant scrutiny, BLM at School tries to focus on not only the values of Black Lives Matter but also the strongest criticisms of the movement's approach.

### [The Internet of Landlords Makes Renters of Us All](https://thereboot.com/the-internet-of-landlords-makes-renters-of-us-all/)

The Internet of Landlords is based on turning all social interactions and economic transactions into "services" mediated by corporate platforms.

The proliferation of platforms fills society with ubiquitous digital intermediaries that spread rentier relations far and wide, at different scales and intensities, while concentrating control over infrastructure and economic value in a small number of large hands.

Breaking the platform economy's cycle of extraction and enclosure can redistribute power over data and infrastructure to the public.

### [Google and the Age of Privacy Theater](https://www.wired.com/story/google-floc-age-privacy-theater/)

Digital privacy is no longer a niche issue, and brands like Google have two choices:

1. Change their business model and respect our privacy
2. Appear to do this while continuing to abuse our privacy

Google is opting for the latter.

> "Google's claim is a classic example of what you might call privacy theater: While marketed as a step forward for consumer privacy, it does very little to change the underlying dynamics of an industry built on surveillance-based behavioral advertising."

### [Disinformation Goes to Hollywood: Four Lessons from Journalism](https://firstdraftnews.org/latest/disinfo-hollywood/)

Whitney Phillips and Clare Wardle on how lessons from television and movies can help build storylines about radicalization and conspiracy theories.

Four lessons for entertainment producers:

- **The most obvious place to point the camera often narrows the story.** Approach stories about white supremacy from the side.
- **The more nuance you bring to white supremacist characters, the more risks there are.** Make sure characters reveal more than the self-explanatory claim that "these kinds of people exist."
- **Light doesn't reliably disinfect.** Consider how someone might use your story to recruit or justify extremist ideology.
- **Tragic personal narratives aren't automatic public services.** Consult experts to understand how to entertain without inadvertently educating toward radicalization.

## 🔨 Do

### [Negentropy: Fighting Chaos in Daily Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negentropy)

I mentioned we bought a house—I have a ton of new projects to complete. To make sense of how to address these challenges, I was thinking about entropy.

Entropy is a measure of how much energy is lost in a system. If a system loses too much energy, it will disintegrate into chaos. Negentropy is how you fight against entropy and chaos in daily life.

Five steps to reverse energy loss:
- Find the entropy
- Prioritize the losses
- Come up with a plan
- Try it out and pay attention
- Go beyond fixing and maintenance

## 🤔 Consider

### You must have chaos within you to give birth to a dancing star.

*Friedrich Nietzsche*

Nietzsche's celebration of productive chaos connects to this issue's threads—the platform economy creating new forms of disorder, privacy theater masking surveillance, and the challenge of teaching difficult subjects without indoctrinating. Sometimes the chaos is the raw material for creation.
