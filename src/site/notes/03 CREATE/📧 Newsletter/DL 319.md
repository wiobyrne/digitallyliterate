## Technology Weirds The World

Welcome back, all. Here is _Digitally Literate_, issue #319.

I posted the following this week:

- _[Digital Wildfires: Tending to social media in the ELA classroom](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uE0iSewSyH-6j-iQ2RzqUweLKUhEkrui_zEkS2xhJYo/edit)_ - Wrote up and just submitted this piece with a great group of colleagues about the challenges of dealing with misinformation and disinformation in/out of the classroom...and what educators can do about it. We've opened the doc for commentary in order to promote open scholarship and peer review. If it is accepted for publication, we'll include your feedback in the manuscript.

## üìö This Week‚Äôs Highlights

### 1. **[Racist Suburbs - Key & Peele](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eAdqq_3ccw)**  
Key & Peele‚Äôs humorous sketches deliver sharp commentary on social issues. This short clip captures the essence of their brilliance.  
**Why this matters**: Humor can be an effective tool for addressing sensitive topics.

### 2. **[Your attention didn‚Äôt collapse. It was stolen](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/jan/02/attention-span-focus-screens-apps-smartphones-social-media)**  
Social media and modern technology have created an ‚Äúattentional pathogenic culture‚Äù that makes sustained focus increasingly rare.  

_...we need to ask if we are now developing ‚Äúan attentional pathogenic culture‚Äù ‚Äì an environment in which sustained and deep focus is harder for all of us._
**Why this matters**: Recognizing the systemic factors affecting attention is key to reclaiming our mental space.

### 3. **[School Board Bans Pulitzer-Winning Graphic Novel About the Holocaust](https://www.thedailybeast.com/tennessee-school-bans-art-spiegelmans-pulitzer-prize-winning-holocaust-book-maus)**  
A Tennessee school board barred schools from teaching a beloved graphic novel about the Holocaust in a unanimous vote the day before Holocaust Remembrance Day. The move to ban Art Spiegelman‚Äôs _Maus_, first [reported by The Tennessee Holler](http://tnholler.com/2022/01/mcminn-county-bans-maus-pulitzer-prize-winning-holocaust-book/), is the latest in a wave of book banning sweeping the country, particularly school districts in conservative areas.

[This Twitter thread by Lisa Corrigan](https://twitter.com/DrLisaCorrigan/status/1487079138435473412) is an excellent explanation of the rationale for book bans and the focus on eroding support for the public good.
**Why this matters**: Censorship threatens critical thinking and historical awareness.

### 4. **[If web3 is the financialisation of the web, then ed3 is merely the (further) financialisation of education](https://dougbelshaw.com/blog/2022-01-26/web3-ed3/)**  
I've been spending a lot of time getting back into distributed, federated technologies and Web3 is one piece of that puzzle.

Good friend Doug Belshaw provides a response to [this post](https://ed3.mirror.xyz/0U3QG8-4K6CD_ltU6SJyKN3-uBD3x6nEFs-YeShzYmk) about Ed3 reimagining education in a decentralized world.

Belshaw indicates that what is exciting is _decentralizing power and decision-making_ as we think about the possibilities. That...and a dash of transparency in the model...and count me in. :)
**Why this matters**: Transparency and decentralized power could reshape educational systems for the better.

### 5. **[The Rot of Candy Crush and The Rest of Wordle](https://annehelen.substack.com/p/the-rot-of-candy-crush-and-the-rest)**  
[Anne Helen Petersen](https://twitter.com/annehelen) on the power of games to serve as fillers in our interstitial or in-between times.

I've found myself playing mobile games, [Kingdom Two Crowns](https://www.kingdomthegame.com/) to be more specific. I've also started up a Minecraft Realms account again for friends and family to reconnect and play. I spend time playing instead of zombie-scrolling social media. I started playing games again when I noticed my partner playing more solitaire before bed...instead of surveying social media.

Petersen suggests that this focus on Candy Crush...and now Wordle is not bringing us together, it's merely distracting us from other parts of our existence.

_This is ultimately a story about _control_. Burnout, particularly when interwoven with depression, makes it difficult to actually choose to do the things that you really _do_ want to do ‚Äî¬†socializing, getting outside, reading the book on your bedside table, not canceling an appointment, showing up for someone, fixing something, just doing something that you choose. You often find yourself on the path of least resistance, whether that means binging a television show you don‚Äôt even really like or scrolling Instagram until you get a recharged life on Candy Crush. You [revenge bedtime procrastinate](https://annehelen.substack.com/p/revenge-bedtime-procrastination). You feel passive in the flow of your own damn life ‚Äî¬†and frustrated that you can‚Äôt muster the strength to redirect it._
**Why this matters**: Understanding our digital habits can help us reclaim control over our time.

### 6. **[GIFs Are For Boomers Now, Sorry](https://www.vice.com/en/article/z3nzb4/gifs-are-for-boomers-now)**  
Amelia Tait examines how GIFs are falling out of favor with younger generations as online trends evolve.  
**Why this matters**: Shifting preferences in digital culture highlight generational differences in communication.
