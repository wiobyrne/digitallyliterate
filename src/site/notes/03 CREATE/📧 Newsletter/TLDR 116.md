This week I sent out the following:

* Video: Use Google Keep like digital sticky notes to save your thoughts (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi169syPIWU)

* Video: Use Google Keep as a digital notepad while you write (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slSo3T06Adw)

Feel free to keep in touch by sending me a note at hello@wiobyrne.com or on the socials at wiobyrne. I received really nice notes from Melissa Techman (https://twitter.com/mtechman) , Aaron Davis (https://twitter.com/mrkrndvs) , and others last week. Thanks a ton! It means a lot to get feedback.

I'm also testing the use of video to provide a "behind the scenes" for my newsletter. I'm sharing this content on my YouTube channel (https://www.youtube.com/user/obyrnei) . Here is last week's overview (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu7YqiluDp4&t=2s) .

============================================================

## 📺 Watch

** This video made $2,573 at auction. How ads work on YouTube (4:34) (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW0eUrUiyxo)

This week a stopped me in the middle of a discussion about building up an online identity and asked how people make money on YouTube. Almost like clockwork, ** Richard Byrne shared this post (http://www.freetech4teachers.com/2017/09/advertising-and-what-youtube-knows.html#.WcUty9OGOHp)

and the video above explaining the role of advertising and the money flowing on YouTube.

## 📚 Read

** You are already living inside a computer (https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/09/you-are-already-living-inside-a-computer/539193/)

** Ian Bogost (https://twitter.com/ibogost)

in ** The Atlantic (https://www.theatlantic.com/)

discusses how futurists initially predicted that we'd be inundated by digital technologies. We've had science fiction and dystopian novels written that warn of these possible futures. Instead of worrying about the possible complications of this on our lives, we've turned computing into a necessary part of our lives.

Some of the more interesting bylines:

* Computers already are predominant, human life already takes place mostly within them, and people are satisfied with the results.

* People don’t seek out computers in order to get things done; they do the things that let them use computers.

* People choose computers as intermediaries for the sensual delight of using computers.

* The present status of intelligent machines is more powerful than any future robot apocalypse.

I also recommend checking out this long read titled ** A sociology of the smartphone (https://longreads.com/2017/06/13/a-sociology-of-the-smartphone/)

. The piece discusses the changing texture of everyday life, and the spaces and rituals we've changed as a result of technological devices.

** Facebook's war on free will (https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/19/facebooks-war-on-free-will)

A thoughtful long read from ** Franklin Foer (https://twitter.com/FranklinFoer)

in ** The Guardian (https://www.theguardian.com/us)

examining how big tech companies and social networks (e.g., Facebook) pretend to be empowering, participatory communities. They create this aura that anyone can say anything and connect. When the reality is that, in the example of Facebook, we're living in a micromanaged system.

The piece discusses a lot of the background for Mark Zuckerberg and some of the ethos behind Facebook. Throughout the read, Foer weaves this thread of possible political ambitions of Zuckerberg, and his reliance on organizing society based on code and algorithms. This version of technocracy eliminates the ** wet code (http://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2006/11/wet-code-and-dry.html)

that frequently bogs down our political systems for rules, procedures, and sorting systems.

Foer ends by making the argument that Facebook ultimately knows more about you...than you know about yourself. They're probably already running models to see how this will all proceed.

** Why your user community needs a Code of Conduct (https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-your-user-community-needs-code-conduct-doug-belshaw)

Doug Belshaw recently has been conducting some work looking at the thoughtful development and facilitation of community online. After the focus of last week's TL;DR (and many of your responses) I thought it might be important to think about positive ways to guide/delineate community participation. Serendipitously, Belshaw comes through again with this overview.

Doug shares a number of openly-licensed documents to use as you consider what to add to your code of conduct. You might also want to check out ** this code of conduct from Medium (https://medium.com/policy/medium-rules-30e5502c4eb4)

.

Belshaw indicates the following sections you'll want to include in your code of conduct:

* Introduction - Why? Why now?

* Scope - How/where does it apply?

* Expected behavior - Consequences for inappropriate behavior. Praise for appropriate behavior.

* Behavior that will not be tolerated - What is not tolerated.

* Consequences - Sanctions for inappropriate behavior.

* How to report an incident - What to do if/when you experience or witness a violation.

* Attribution and acknowledgements - Are you building on the work of others? Are you willing to share?

** 7 skills your child needs to survive the changing world of work (https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/09/skills-children-need-work-future/)

Seven skills from ** Tony Wagner's (https://twitter.com/DrTonyWagner)

book, ** The Global Achievement Gap: Why Even Our Best Schools Don't Teach the New Survival Skills Our Children Need--And What We Can Do About It (https://www.amazon.com/o/isbn/0465002293/thedailyriffc-20)

.

* Critical thinking and problem solving

* Collaboration across networks and leading by influence

* Agility and adaptability

* Initiative and entrepreneurialism

* Effective oral and written communication

* Accessing and analyzing information

* Curiosity and imagination

Watch Wagner describe it all in ** this video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NS2PqTTxFFc)

.

** Tech's push to teach coding isn't about kids' success - it's about cutting wages (https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/21/coding-education-teaching-silicon-valley-wages)

** Ben Tarnoff (https://twitter.com/bentarnoff)

in ** The Guardian (https://www.theguardian.com/us)

examining the possible reasons why tech companies are so gung-ho in pushing coding and programming in and out of schools. Typically we see these coding clubs, and free resources online and think they're great ways to spread this information and the requisite skills. Tarnoff provides an interesting alternative rationale for the spread of this initiative. He sees it as an attempt to flood the market with highly trained, skilled coders...to force wages down.

Keep in mind, whether or not we include coding and programming in instruction, we should provide opportunities for students to ** engage in computational thinking and participation (http://wiobyrne.com/computational-participation-coding-and-programming-as-literacy-activities/)

. This involves opportunities to think "algorithmically" in problem solving.

## 🔨 Do

** Create interactive diagrams on Quizlet (http://www.freetech4teachers.com/2017/09/create-interactive-diagrams-on-quizlet.html#.WcUjwNOGNTY)

Another great resource from ** Richard Byrne (https://twitter.com/rmbyrne)

.

** Quizlet (https://quizlet.com/)

is a great tool to help you learn anything. I use it to pre-load vocab words from my classes to help students pick up the terms they'll need.

Their new interactive diagrams feature allows you to build in notes and scaffolding to uploaded images. Watch ** this video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bFcov4KAvw)

to learn more.

You are not controlling the storm, and you are not lost in it. You are the storm.
