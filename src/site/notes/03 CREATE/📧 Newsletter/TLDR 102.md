## 📺 Watch

** Binging with Babish: Freddy's Ribs from House of Cards (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uHhKAjnvNc)

I'm sharing this video for a number of reasons. Yes, it does relate to House of Cards. Yes, it relates to Frank Underwood and things local to me in South Carolina. Yes, it showcases how to make some incredible ribs. Now that my Wife and I are on a 60 day challenge to be vegetarians...this is a tough video to watch. :)

More importantly, I'm constantly studying the use of YouTube to teach. In this case it's all about teaching how to cook, but we know many people that learn through YouTube.

The ** Binging with Babish channel (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJHA_jMfCvEnv-3kRjTCQXw)

has a great style and storyline behind the videos. I also like the framing of his shots in the video. It is thinking outside of the box.

## 📚 Read

Over the past couple of weeks, we've had ** a series of incidents (https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/14/business/women-sexism-work-huffington-kamala-harris.html)

in which men have talked down, or talked over women as they try to make points in public forums.

In my own work, I've been increasingly concerned about the discourse online (and face-to-face) as we negotiate gender, race, social class, and other issues of diversity.

This piece by Andrew Reiner in the NY Times examines some of the research and literacy practices behind the words we use as we talk to children.

We need to think deeply about the words we use and the weight they carry.

** A Guide for Resisting EdTech: The case against Turnitin (http://www.digitalpedagogylab.com/hybridped/resisting-edtech/)

Over the past two weeks, I've started to sit in on a couple webchats with the great group at ** Virtually Connecting (http://virtuallyconnecting.org/)

. In these discussions, there has been a slight pushback against some of the ed tech tools/silos that we frequently jump into...and push our students into using.

This piece in ** Hybrid Pedagogy (http://www.digitalpedagogylab.com/hybridped/)

by ** Sean Michael Morris (https://twitter.com/slamteacher)

and ** Jesse Stommel (https://twitter.com/Jessifer)

tackles the questions that exist as we dump our own content (and that of our students) into the learning management system selected by our institutions.

In most cases, we don't ask these questions about the tools that we use. We either trust them, or don't know enough that we (perhaps) shouldn't trust them. Morris and Stommel indicate the concern that we should have, and provide a rubric to help evaluate these tools.

** In Rhode Island, some schools think they have the right to spy on students with school laptops (https://www.aclu.org/blog/speak-freely/rhode-island-some-schools-think-they-have-right-spy-students-school-laptops)

In 2010, a lot of news was made in the "** webcam case (https://www.aclupa.org/news/2010/04/05/aclu-seeks-to-protect-students-privacy-in-lower-merion-school-district-laptop-lawsuit)

" against Lower Merion School District. In this, the school district was remotely spying on students through the webcams installed on school-issued laptops.

History repeats itself, but on a grander scale in the state of Rhode Island. Most Rhode Island school districts participate in a "1 to 1 program" in which third parties provide free laptops for students to use during the year. The ACLU found out that most of the state's school districts give themselves the ability to remotely spy on their students.

** Providing some clarity on open badges (http://dougbelshaw.com/blog/2017/06/14/open-badges-2/)

The open badges landscape has undergone a lot of transition over the last year. There has been a lot happening in the field as we approach the release of version 2.0 of the ** Open Badges specification (https://openbadges.org/)

.

This post by ** Doug Belshaw (https://twitter.com/dajbelshaw)

explains what version 2.0 means both on the technical level, and what this means as we issue/earn/display badges.

Some of the information Belshaw shares is technical, and some a bit historical. I think this work, and growth happening over time are extremely important to pay attention to. Especially for those of us studying teaching, learning, and technology.

** A whimsical wordsmith charts a course beyond Twitter (https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/15/magazine/a-whimsical-wordsmith-charts-a-course-beyond-twitter.html?_r=0)

I enjoy pieces like this that focus on an individual as they build up their digital identity to some degree of success. It helps me think about the possibilities as I shape my own identity...and as I help others shape their digital selves.

This piece focuses on Jonny Sun, or as he is known on Twitter...** jomny sun (https://twitter.com/jonnysun)

. It describes the path he has taken to build up this identity, and possible next directions. Sun is currently a PhD in urban studies at MIT.

## 🔨 Do

We've talked a lot about cold brew coffee a lot here in the Make section of TL;DR. One of the things that I've been waiting to try is ** nitro cold brew (http://www.esquire.com/food-drink/drinks/a35593/nitro-coffee-explained/)

. Until I can talk my Wife into letting me install a nitrogen tank system into the kitchen...this might be the next best thing.

To make your own carbonated cold brew, I recommend first making your own cold brew coffee. You won't regret it. Email me and I'll share my tools and recipe. We always have a jug of iced cold brew in the house.

The post then suggests a 50/50 mix of ** LaCroix Coconut (http://www.lacroixwater.com/flavors/)

and cold brew coffee. The author of the post was not too fond of this initial mixture. I thought the 50/50 mixture wasn't too bad. I then added a splash of almond milk and it's great. I'm enjoying it as I finish this newsletter. Let me know what you think.

## 🤔 Consider

Reach for the stars, even if you have to stand on a cactus.
