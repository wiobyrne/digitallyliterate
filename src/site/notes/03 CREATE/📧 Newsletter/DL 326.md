# DL 326  

Welcome to _Digitally Literate_, issue #326.  

Thank you to everyone who sent messages of support over the last week. I shared [the eulogy for my father](https://wiobyrne.com/bearing-witness/) on my blog, and I appreciate the kindness shown during this time. It feels good to return to sharing and learning together here in DL.

#### [Outrage! Our Minds and Morals Did Not Evolve to Cope with Social Media](https://bigthink.com/thinking/outrage/)  

Outrage is a useful emotion that helped our ancient ancestors survive. It is an evolutionarily useful emotion because it punishes rulebreakers and keeps people in line. Today, we express much of our outrage online, which serves no particular purpose and only rarely addresses the moral offense or seeks to correct it. Ultimately, this leaves us feeling angry, tired, powerless, and miserable.

We are not slaves to our nature. We can disengage from outrage.

#### [Why the School Wars Still Rage](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022-03-21/why-the-school-wars-still-rage)  

Jill Lepore reflects on the century-long battle over public education. Today’s debates echo historical struggles, with teachers caught in the crossfire of political and societal expectations, all while addressing students’ post-pandemic needs.  

_There and elsewhere, parents are harassing school boards and reporting on teachers, at a time when teachers, who earn too little and are asked to do too much, are already exhausted by battles over remote instruction and mask and vaccine mandates and, not least, by witnessing, without being able to repair, the damage the pandemic has inflicted on their students. Kids carry the burdens of loss, uncertainty, and shaken faith on their narrow shoulders, tucked inside their backpacks. Now, with schools open and masks coming off, teachers are left trying to figure out not only how to care for them but also what to teach, and how to teach it, without losing their jobs owing to complaints filed by parents._

#### [Teachers Are Done. No, Really.](https://medium.com/age-of-awareness/teachers-are-done-no-really-def0ff5d8d31)  

Prior to the pandemic, we identified what was first labeled as a teacher shortage. This then became a teacher exodus, at least in my state. As the pandemic slowly retreats into the distance and this school year ends, I have a feeling the new school year will begin, and parents/society will get a good glimpse of [the trouble were in](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/rosiegray/america-teaching-collapse-covid-education).

This reflection by [Dina Ley](https://dinachka82.medium.com/) and her [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/dinachka82/status/1511127986078167046) underscore the urgency of supporting educators.

1. Praise in public, criticize in private.  
2. Use "I" language to express impact.  
3. Be specific with SBI (situation-behavior-impact).  
4. Approach feedback as a collaboration.  
5. Avoid addressing issues when emotions are high.  
6. Create a tight feedback loop for continuous improvement.
