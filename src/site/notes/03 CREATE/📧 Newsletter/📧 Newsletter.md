# 📧 Newsletter

Welcome to **Digitally Literate** — *weekly strategy on digital literacy, AI, and media in a changing world.*

## 📬 Why Subscribe?

Every week, I send **1,000+ educators, researchers, and innovators** a short, actionable briefing on the forces shaping learning in the digital age.  
No noise — just the **frameworks, insights, and tools** you need to:

- **Understand** emerging technologies like AI and their impact on literacy and learning  
- **See past** the hype and into the systems driving change  
- **Build strategies** for equitable, future-ready education  

I’ve spent over a decade studying and shaping the field, co-authoring the **Mozilla Web Literacy Framework** and **NCTE’s Definition of Literacy in a Digital Age**, and helping design the **Open Badges** system for digital credentialing.

## ✍️ What You’ll Get

- **Weekly strategic briefings** on digital literacy, AI, and education  
- **Curated links & analysis** from my 800+ published articles and research

## 🌱 How It Fits in the Garden

The newsletter is the **front porch** of my work — the place where I share what I’m noticing, testing, and building before it becomes part of my longer-form blog or evergreen digital garden.

Subscribing means you get these insights **first**, with the context to put them to work in your own classrooms, institutions, or projects.
