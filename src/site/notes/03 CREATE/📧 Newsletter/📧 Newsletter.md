## 🌱 How It Fits in the Garden

The newsletter is the **front porch** of my work — where I share what I'm noticing, testing, and building before it becomes part of my longer-form writing or evergreen digital garden.

Subscribing means you get these insights **first**, with the context to put them to work in your own classrooms, institutions, or projects.
