Thank you once again for being one of the first to sign up for this newsletter. In this weekly email, I'll pull together some of the content that I shared out throughout the week. It's basically things that I think you should know & discuss. Please feel free to respond back, and share out with others.

I had two posts this week:
- [Understanding the next steps with the web literacy map](http://wiobyrne.com/understanding-the-next-steps-with-the-web-literacy-map/)
- [ReMEDIAting my digital identity for make cycle #2 of the CLMOOC](http://wiobyrne.com/remediating-my-digital-identity-for-make-cycle-2-clmooc/)

This week we started up my final stretch of classes at UNH. These include the starting & ending sequence of classes in the [IT&DML](http://wiobyrne.com/course-sequence-for-the-instructional-technology-digital-media-literacy-program/) program.

## 📺 Watch

### [Star Wars: The Force Awakens - Comic-Con 2015 Reel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTNJ51ghzdY)

A special look behind the scenes of Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Yes...I'm sharing this because it's Star Wars. I'm also intrigued by the use of live action, and the awareness of the limitations of computer generated imagery (CGI) by the directors. It's an interesting commentary by a group that is trying to make a film that uses the newest in digital technologies, but still connects back to the original films.

## 📚 Read

### [Everything Science Knows About Reading on Screens](http://www.fastcodesign.com/3048297/evidence/everything-science-knows-about-reading-on-screens?partner=rss)

We often engage in this debate about whether or not online reading is really reading. In [2008 the NY Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/27/books/27reading.html?hp) took some of our research from the [NLRL](http://newliteracies.uconn.edu/) to look at how reading has changed. My opinion is that the skills of reading online (and on screens) is the same, yet different in some ways to reading offline. We do need to recognize that reading on a screen...especially a screen of different sizes will have consequences.

### [The Higher Life: A Mindfulness Guru for the Tech Set](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/06/the-higher-life)

I've been doing a lot of research on meditation and some of [the skepticism](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/meta-meditation-a-skeptic-meditates-on-meditation/) surrounding it. I'm starting a new 30 day challenge in which I'll be meditating every day. I'll start by using the Headspace app mentioned in the piece from the New Yorker.

### [Why Start with Pedagogy? 4 Good Reasons, 4 Good Solutions](http://www.hybridpedagogy.com/journal/why-start-with-pedagogy-4-good-reasons-4-good-solutions/)

Excellent post from [Cathy Davidson](https://twitter.com/cathyndavidson) in which she makes the case for focusing on pedagogy in education. Despite all of the challenges in the world, by focusing on your classroom and pedagogical choices, educators can act as agents of social change.

### [MIT and German Research on the [Appalling] Use of Video in xMOOCs](http://www.tonybates.ca/2015/07/08/mit-and-german-research-on-the-appalling-use-of-video-in-xmoocs/)

[The research](http://ssrn.com/abstract=2577882) examines the use of video as a teaching tool in professor-centric massive open online courses (xMOOC). Some of the takeaways from the research provide some insight into best practices for open learning. Specifically, "Think twice before using video.... it seems problematic that online learning pedagogy is concentrated so heavily in this medium."

### [Google Frees Its Dream Robots to Run Wild Across the Internet](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/02/google-electric-sheep-image-processing-neural-network-algorithm)

Early last week this post made the rounds online and sparked some curiosity as we looked at what happens if/when robots/androids dream. This week the images and videos got a [bit more](http://boingboing.net/2015/07/07/googles-deep-dreaming-fills.html) [strange](http://boingboing.net/2015/07/08/fhtagn-the-inceptionized-rout.html).

### [Why Character Development in Education Might Not Be Such a Good Idea](http://thinktankreview.co.uk/education/character-development-in-education/)

According to a [Demos report](http://www.demos.co.uk/publications/character-nation), education focused on the development of character and specific traits may not be a good idea. It is not known how embedding these traits in education enhances or modifies learning objectives. It also may ignore cultural or societal values placed on these characteristics.

### [Reddit Moderators Are Locking Up the Site's Most Popular Pages in Protest](http://techcrunch.com/2015/07/02/reddit-is-blowing-up/?ncid=rss#.hafbhd:2M6x)

If you've never heard of [Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/), it is a web-based blog that displays news based on personal preferences and community likes. Reddit is often called the "front page of the Internet" and the backbone of this community are the moderators for the individual discussions, or "subreddits" on the site. The protest stems from the firing of Victoria Taylor who was one of the key advocates for the "Ask Me Anything" interviews and a contact for most moderators.

At the end of the week, [Ellen Pao steps down as CEO after the Reddit revolt](http://www.wired.com/2015/07/reddit-ceo-ellen-pao-steps-down-huffman-replacement/).

### [Author Ernie Cline Was Told Video Games Would Rot His Brain](http://www.motherjones.com/media/2015/06/ernest-cline-armada-ready-player-one-steven-spielberg-virtual-reality)

After you read this post, go read [Ready Player One](http://www.amazon.com/Ready-Player-One-A-Novel/dp/0307887448). By the time you're finished, you'll be ready for when his latest, [Armada](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0804137250/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_dp_ss_2?pf_rd_p=1944687562&pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe-1&pf_rd_t=201&pf_rd_i=0307887448&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_r=00G02FMDE6QJAFRH5HXC) is released on July 14th, 2015.

Sign up for this open badges course put together by [Doug Belshaw](https://twitter.com/dajbelshaw/) and [Bryan Mathers](http://twitter.com/BryanMMathers). As an added bonus, they're [releasing the course on GitHub](https://github.com/thinkoutloudclub/badge-course/wiki/Help-improve-the-Open-Badges-101-course), so you can edit/revise/comment as you see fit.

## 🤔 Consider

### Despite all of the challenges in the world, by focusing on your classroom and pedagogical choices, educators can act as agents of social change.

*Cathy Davidson*

Davidson's argument resonates across this issue's threads—from rethinking how we use video in online learning, to questioning character education's cultural assumptions, to communities revolting against platforms that ignore them. Change happens at the intersection of individual choices and collective action. Your classroom, your pedagogy, your decisions matter.
