** Too Long; Didn't Read (TL;DR) newsletter #19

------------------------------------------------------------

Brought to you by Ian O'Byrne (https://twitter.com/wiobyrne) . Read more at my blog (http://wiobyrne.com/) .

Thank you for subscribing to this newsletter. Please feel free to share with others you believe would benefit. In TL;DR I'm sharing things that happened during the week in literacy, technology, and education that I think you should know.

Thanks again for the support. :)

This week I worked on the following:

* Web Literacy Map: Read, write, & participate for a better web (http://wiobyrne.com/webliteracy/)  - This week the video I produced documenting the history of the web literacy map up to this point for the K12 Online Conference (http://k12onlineconference.org/) was finally released (http://k12onlineconference.org/2015/10/27/web-literacy-map-version-1-5-read-write-and-participate-for-a-better-web/) . You can check out all of the great work at the 2015 schedule page (http://k12onlineconference.org/2015-schedule/) . I'll share the video I created down below. I think I spent a bit too much time on it. :)

* Getting started in Medium: D (http://wiobyrne.com/starting-medium-reading/) rafting, writing, and publishing (https://medium.com/the-slackerati/getting-started-in-medium-drafting-writing-and-publishing-58c7321e5eff#.70b7kmg7z) - As I discussed last week in this newsletter, I've started guiding a group of colleagues as they start up blogging. The end result is that we'll syndicate a publication together using Medium. In my first post (https://medium.com/@wiobyrne/getting-started-in-medium-reading-annotating-commenting-and-recommending-757f43be83ee#.p2cgqed9r) , I discussed starting up a Medium account, reading, and annotating content. This week I focus on drafting, writing, and publishing in Medium. I've been crossposting my work on Medium and LinkedIN lately. The link above is to the version on Medium. I'll share more next week as I look at how we syndicate to one publication. I'll also soon invite more people in as I share this with the broader audience in the Literacy

Research Association.

## 📺 Watch

Web Literacy Map, Version 1.5: Read, write, and participate for a better web

The video above is the piece I produced and shared for K12 Online 2015, as I documented in the post above. The resultant piece is part documentary, part satire, part critique of the current state of ed tech, and all remix using tons of CC-licensed content. Enjoy. :)

## 📚 Read

** Sharing, gifting, and the moral evolution of the social web (https://medium.com/@timrayner01/sharing-gifting-and-the-moral-evolution-of-the-social-web-8cf75495da66#.fchalvgch)

As I spend more time in Medium, I have to admit that I like some of the pieces that the system pops up in my feed. An example of this "serendipity" is this piece by ** Tim Rayner (https://twitter.com/timrayner01)

on how we consume, share, and gift online.

In this post, Tim is discussing the affordances of the online social space, and what behaviors do we want to promote as we connect with others. I've been thinking more and more about this in the context of this newsletter, blogging, teaching, and other activities.

"Sharing is cool, but it’s not the potential of the web. The potential of the web as a connective tissue for human beings is gifting — that is, sharing for impact."

Great post by ** Kathleen Fitzpatrick (https://twitter.com/kfitz)

from the ** Modern Language Association (https://www.mla.org/)

. This post primarily focuses on the use and development of the ** MLA Commons (https://commons.mla.org/)

to allow scholars to disseminate their work.

The broader perspective in this post focuses on the questions that exist as we share our work out online. Some of my colleagues will share their work and publications out on their website. Many more will post their work to ** Academia.edu (https://www.academia.edu/)

or ** ResearchGate (http://www.researchgate.net/)

.

Put simply, when you post your work to these spaces, you to need to consider the motives and purposes of these business and what they'll with, or for your work.

My quick response? Build up your own online space, share out your work, share it everywhere the readers are located.

** No more pencils, no more books: Artificial intelligence is replacing the textbook - and reshaping American education (http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2015/10/adaptive_learning_software_is_replacing_textbooks_and_upending_american.html)

A thought provoking piece from ** Will Oremus (https://twitter.com/WillOremus)

at ** Slate (http://www.slate.com/)

. The post discusses the fact that as many educators, researchers and scholars argue about flipping classrooms, MOOCs, project-based learning...publishers are leading the way and reinventing themselves as ed tech companies with the solution.

The thinking is that adaptive software and artificial intelligence might first be able to help students answer problems and pass standardized tests. But, as technology advances, it might be able to make inferences about conceptual understanding.

** . S. DOE launches campaign to encourage schools to #GoOpen with educational resources (http://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-launches-campaign-encourage-schools-goopen-educational-resources)

This week the U.S. Department of Education announced the new regulations to spur the creation, distribution, and use of open educational resources. Open licensed educational resources are learning materials that can be used for teaching, learning, and assessment without cost. They can be modified and redistributed without violating copyright laws.

Specifically, the DOE announced that proposed new regulations would require all copyrightable intellectual property created with Department grant funds to have an open license. :)

Digital writing as mode of thinking

Great post by ** Mia Zamora (https://twitter.com/MiaZamoraPhD)

on DMLCentral examining the consideration of voice, audience, and context as digital tools expand our concepts of "writing."

This post kicks off ** Digital Writing Month (http://www.digitalwritingmonth.com/)

(#DigiWriMo) and focuses on four broad themes:

1. Writing: The Shifting Notions of Writing;

2. Visual: Using our Lens to Compose;

3. Audio: The Story of Sound and Waves; and

4. Transmedia: Pushing into the Edges of Stories.

** (http://www.wired.com/2015/06/lexus-hoverboard-slide/)

** Obama Administration calls for limits on testing in schools (http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/25/us/obama-administration-calls-for-limits-on-testing-in-schools.html)

I'm grudgingly sharing this out in this week's newsletter. Many of my students and colleagues heard ** this news on NPR (http://www.npr.org/2015/10/25/451643558/president-obama-calls-to-curb-number-of-standardized-tests?utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=education)

, and were obviously excited. I'll believe it more when I see changes happening.

While we're at it...let's give every student a domain of their own, authentically use tech and digital literacies in schools, and value educators a bit more. :)

## 🔨 Do

** ake and share animated GIFs (http://lifehacker.com/the-complete-guide-to-making-animated-gifs-1503276993)

You may consider GIFs (** Graphic Interchange Formats (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIF)

) to be annoying/silly/awesome online. You may argue about how to pronounce the term. Whatever your vantage point...start using, sharing, and most of all making animated GIFs to add to publications.

Throughout my blogs, I experiment with the use of GIFs to share information. I often use a mix of still images and videos. In many of these posts, I'm finding that it's far better to include text, and then a short, animated GIF showing while I tell.

I'm also realizing that there is a subtle art in making a GIF, presenting it on the page, and not making it annoying. My current practice involves the use of ** Recordit (http://recordit.co/)

, and using the crosshairs to focus on small windows..and small movements. Aim small...miss small.

There is nothing to writing. All you do is sit down at a typewriter and bleed.
