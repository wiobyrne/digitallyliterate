Digitally Lit #258 - 9/5/2020

Welcome back to Digitally Literate and issue #258. I took off the month of August from this newsletter and my social media feeds. I discuss more about this below.

If you haven’t already, please subscribe (https://digitallyliterate.net/subscribe/) if you would like this newsletter to show up in your inbox. Feel free to reach out and let me know what you think of this work at hello@digitallyliterate.net (mailto:hello@digitallyliterate.net) .

This week I worked on the following:

* Gone for a minute (https://wiobyrne.com/gone-for-a-minute/) - I was on a digital detox for the month of August. I disconnected to focus on my family as we prepare for the upcoming academic year.

* Is social media bad for us? (https://wiobyrne.com/is-social-media-bad-for-us/) - Every week in this newsletter we see evidence that social media might not be good for us.

I’m in the process of making changes to my social media feeds and signals. This will include modifying content in this newsletter. I hope you’ll forgive me as you see some loose wires for a couple of weeks.

** I Write the Songs (https://reallifemag.com/i-write-the-songs/)

------------------------------------------------------------

A fascinating long read about algorithms and how they try to replicate the “creation of coercive fun.”
