Welcome back to Digitally Literate and issue #258. I took off the month of August from this newsletter and my social media feeds. I discuss more about this below.

If you haven't already, please [subscribe](https://digitallyliterate.net/subscribe/) if you would like this newsletter to show up in your inbox. Feel free to reach out and let me know what you think of this work at [hello@digitallyliterate.net](mailto:hello@digitallyliterate.net).

This week I worked on the following:

- *[Gone for a minute](https://wiobyrne.com/gone-for-a-minute/)* - I was on a digital detox for the month of August. I disconnected to focus on my family as we prepare for the upcoming academic year.
- *[Is social media bad for us?](https://wiobyrne.com/is-social-media-bad-for-us/)* - Every week in this newsletter we see evidence that social media might not be good for us.

I'm in the process of making changes to my social media feeds and signals. This will include modifying content in this newsletter. I hope you'll forgive me as you see some loose wires for a couple of weeks.

### [U.S. court: Mass surveillance program exposed by Snowden was illegal](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-nsa-spying-idUSKBN25T3CK)

U.S. court says mass surveillance program exposed by Snowden was illegal.

Warrantless telephone dragnet that secretly collected millions of Americans' telephone records violated Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act & may have been unconstitutional.

Keep in mind this is still focused on "Americans" data.

### [All Students Need Anti-racism Education](https://www.tolerance.org/magazine/all-students-need-antiracism-education)

Schools across the nation are committing to the all-important work of anti-racism. Schools with predominately white or privileged students should be no exception.

- Teachers must re-evaluate their curriculum
- Students need to understand privilege and rethink power
- Schools must interrogate their practices and how they gained institutional privilege to begin with

### [The Privileged Have Entered Their Escape Pods](https://onezero.medium.com/the-privileged-have-entered-their-escape-pods-4706b4893af7)

This piece by Douglas Rushkoff is a followup to "*[Survival of the Richest](https://onezero.medium.com/survival-of-the-richest-9ef6cddd0cc1)*," a report about how the wealthy plot to leave us behind after an apocalyptic event.

> Unlike their human mothers, a predictive algorithm could anticipate their every need in advance and deliver it directly, removing every trace of friction and longing.

### [I Write the Songs](https://reallifemag.com/i-write-the-songs/)

A fascinating long read about algorithms and how they try to replicate the "creation of coercive fun."

> Requiring novelty is a learned behavior. When you consume an algorithmic feed, you are constituted as a subject who is continually winning at wanting.

Video games can provide young people with a route into reading and improve confidence in reading & writing skills. Video games can have potential benefits for increasing empathy & mental wellbeing.

Digitally Literate is a weekly review of the news, notes, tips, and tricks from the week that resonated with me.

I really love white noise generators while I'm working. The [Implanted Memories](https://mynoise.net/NoiseMachines/november2019SoundscapeGenerator.php) and [Electric Sheep](https://mynoise.net/NoiseMachines/customElectricSheep.php) audio streams are perfect if you want that Blade Runner vibe all day while you're working.

**Connected concepts**:
- [[Snowden Surveillance Vindication\|Snowden Surveillance Vindication]] - Seven years after Snowden's revelations, U.S. courts finally rule the warrantless telephone dragnet violated FISA and may have been unconstitutional. The vindication matters, but the damage is done—millions of Americans' records collected illegally, and the surveillance infrastructure remains. The caveat "still focused on 'Americans' data" reveals how national security framing excludes non-citizens from even theoretical privacy protections.
- [[Anti-Racism Education for Privileged Institutions\|Anti-Racism Education for Privileged Institutions]] - The call for anti-racism education in predominantly white/privileged schools challenges the assumption that this work only belongs where diversity already exists. Teachers re-evaluating curriculum, students understanding privilege, schools interrogating how they gained institutional advantage—this centers whiteness as the problem requiring intervention, not marginalized students needing support. Connects to debates about whether diversity work should focus on including the excluded or educating the privileged.
- [[Algorithmic Escape Pods and Frictionless Desire\|Algorithmic Escape Pods and Frictionless Desire]] - Douglas Rushkoff connects wealthy escape pod mentality to algorithmic platforms removing all friction and longing. When predictive algorithms anticipate every need in advance, desire itself becomes manufactured. "Continually winning at wanting" through algorithmic feeds creates subjects who confuse consumption with fulfillment. This connects to surveillance capitalism's endgame: not just predicting behavior but manufacturing it.
