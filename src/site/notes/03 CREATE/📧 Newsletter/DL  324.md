Welcome back all. Here is _Digitally Literate_, issue 324.

I spent as much of my time offline as possible this week. In a shift toward tactile creativity, I've started converting part of my garage into a makerspace. Stay tuned for updates as this new project takes shape.

I hope you and those around you are well.

### [Merci! by Christine Rabette](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gipL_CEw-fk)

Written and directed by Christine Rabette, _Merci!_ is a beautifully simple short film set in the Metro, where laughter is rare and moments of joy are even rarer.

Known as _The Laughing Bodhisattva_, the film stars Jan Hammenecker as a seemingly ordinary man who unexpectedly transforms the day for everyone in his train carriage. A reminder that small acts of unexpected joy can ripple through even the most mundane spaces.

### [TikTok Was Designed for War](https://www.wired.com/story/ukraine-russia-war-tiktok/)

As the Russia-Ukraine conflict unfolds, TikTok has emerged as a central stage for this "social media war." While platforms like Facebook and Twitter previously defined such conflicts, TikTok's immediacy and algorithm seem purpose-built for chaotic events.

However, the platform's design enables misinformation to thrive alongside authentic stories. TikTok's rapid-fire video format often sacrifices context and critical analysis for emotional resonance, compounding the challenges of discerning truth.

The question for media literacy educators: How do we equip ourselves and others to evaluate these streams critically?

### [You Don't Need to Post Through a Crisis](https://embedded.substack.com/p/you-dont-need-to-post-through-a-crisis?s=r)

In an era when every crisis feels like a call to post, it's worth asking: Do we always need to share? [Kate Lindsay](https://twitter.com/kathrynfiona) and [Nick Catucci](https://twitter.com/catucci) explore this tension, urging us to resist the compulsion to add noise to digital spaces during global tragedies.

Social media collapses contexts, placing reels of roller skaters next to photos of conflict zones. Navigating this space requires thoughtful restraint. Just because we _can_ post doesn't mean we _should_.

### [The Link Between Depression and Misinformation](https://mashable.com/article/depression-misinformation-mental-health)

A recent study by Dr. Roy Perlis at Harvard Medical School suggests that addressing mental health issues like depression could also diminish susceptibility to misinformation.

This connection underscores the need to approach misinformation through multiple lenses—mental health, digital literacy, and community well-being—rather than just focusing on algorithmic tweaks or content moderation. The intersection of psychological vulnerability and information quality deserves more attention.

### [Can We Move Beyond Food?](https://www.discovermagazine.com/health/can-we-move-beyond-food)

Meal replacements like Soylent promise efficiency, but what do we sacrifice when we replace food with formulas? This article dives into the cultural, emotional, and even spiritual aspects of food consumption—and what might be lost in a future where meals are optional.

## 🔨 Do

### [Mood and Healthy Behavior](https://digest.bps.org.uk/2022-02-21/when-were-in-a-good-mood-were-more-likely-to-engage-in-healthy-behaviours/)

A recent study suggests a positive mood encourages healthy behaviors, while negative moods hinder them. Sleep and social connections also play critical roles. What small actions could you take today to boost your mood and, in turn, your well-being?

## 🤔 Consider

### It is passivity that dulls feeling.

*Susan Sontag*

Sontag's words cut to the heart of this issue's themes—the passive scrolling that numbs us, the crisis posting that substitutes for action, the depression that makes us vulnerable to false narratives. Becoming "extremely offline" isn't retreat; it's an active choice to feel more deeply by engaging differently.
