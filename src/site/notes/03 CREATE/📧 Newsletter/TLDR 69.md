** Too Long; Didn't Read (TL;DR) newsletter #69

------------------------------------------------------------

Welcome to issue 69 of the TL;DR Newsletter. In TL;DR I'm synthesizing what I read and learned this week in literacy, technology, and education. Hallo!!!

This week we consider that, for better or worse....the internet isn't trying to kill you.

If you haven't already, I'd recommend that you subscribe (http://wiobyrne.us11.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=7b5ee323a16720dad25ff96ff&id=17e92a2ae1)  to make sure you don't miss out next week's issue. You can review archives of the newsletter here (http://us11.campaign-archive1.com/home/?u=7b5ee323a16720dad25ff96ff&id=17e92a2ae1) . Alternatively you can also check out TL;DR on Medium (https://medium.com/tldr-newsletter) . I'm also testing the reposting of these issues after a short delay on LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/wiobyrne?trk=nav_responsive_tab_profile) to see what happens.

This week I worked on the following:

* Moving from digital portoflios to a domain of one's own (http://wiobyrne.com/digital-portfolios-and-dooo/) - This post shares some of my recent thinking about a "domain of one's own." This is connected to my posts about eportfolios, BadgeChain, and digital identity. More to come.

* Digital portfolios (http://wiobyrne.com/digital-portfolios/) - This post provides a comprehensive overview of what you'll need to know as you start thinking/working with digital portfolios.

* Negotiating the positive and negative as a citizen of the world (http://wiobyrne.com/imho/2016/negotiating-the-positive-negative-as-a-citizen-of-the-world) - On the fifth day of StoicWeek 2016 I wrote this about considering how we fit into the larger picture.

* Resilience and preparation for adversity (http://wiobyrne.com/imho/2016/resilience-and-preparation-for-adversity) - On the sixth day of StoicWeek 2016 I shared this post about how to prepare for when the times get tough.

* Exercise on learning from the view from above (http://wiobyrne.com/imho/2016/exercise-on-learning-from-the-view-from-above) - On the seventh day of StoicWeek 2016 I shared this post about a guided meditation strategy to help you remain focused on the task at hand...and not get overwhelmed by the world.

## 📺 Watch

** What does A. I. have to do with this selfie? (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHmp26bh0tI)

Awesome video detailing how artificial intelligence (AI) is used in the process of "style transfer" as we turn our photos and videos into new works of art. The computer science is fascinating we they look at deep neural nets used to identify patterns, layers, and styles in your photo and other exemplars.

## 📚 Read

Late last night the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) delivered a landmark ruling in favor of online privacy here in the U.S. The FCC approved new rules to ensure that your internet service provider (ISP) is not abusing their use of your app usage and browsing history to sell to others. This is a big step forward in building a future in which citizens of the web have an opportunity to control their private data.

What remains to be seen is what happens when the government requests your information, or your ** communication company (AT&T) creates a business providing it to them (https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/10/att-requires-police-hide-hemisphere-phone-spying)

. We also need to be concerned about how other businesses (** Google (https://www.propublica.org/article/google-has-quietly-dropped-ban-on-personally-identifiable-web-tracking)

) may be tracking us online as well.

** The internet of things isn't trying to kill you (https://medium.com/@gigastacey/the-internet-of-things-isnt-trying-to-kill-you-443fee5c83f#.b5gmr2509)

Last week you may or may not have noticed that the ** internet was broken (http://nymag.com/selectall/2016/10/ddos-internet-outage-dyn-dns.html)

for a short period of time. In short, this was a DDoS (Distributed ** Denial of Service (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack)

) Attack. This is a cyber attack in which a malicious entity organizes a massive amount of bots, computers, or internet connected machines to all target and load one website. Think about millions and millions of these attackers all knocking on the door of the Target.com website. When you type in the web address and try to load the page...nothing will happen. This is because the website is being overrun with millions of others all trying to get in.

This latest DDoS is said to be organized around IoT (** Internet of Things (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things)

) devices. This means that internet connected televisions, thermostats, routers...any thing that is online potentially could be used as a bot in these attacks and you would never even know it. If your device is connected to the internet, and you cannot change a password to control it...you have to wonder what it is doing when you're not looking. I'm really concerned about the potential ramifications.

This post from ** Stacy Higginbotham (https://twitter.com/gigastacey)

sets the record straight about where our concerns should be directed. She indicates that we should be a bit more concerned about security when we plug in our devices. We also need a much more granular understanding of what we mean by "security."

** Should you cover your webcam? (https://blog.mozilla.org/internetcitizen/2016/10/25/webcam-cover-privacy/?utm_source=email&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=mii-10-27-16)

As noted in this post from the Mozilla blog, ** Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg (https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/22/mark-zuckerberg-tape-webcam-microphone-facebook)

and ** FBI Director James Comey (http://gizmodo.com/fbi-director-says-you-should-cover-your-webcam-with-tap-1786630719)

have been seen to cover up their webcams when not in use. I also regularly see my students come into class with tape over their webcam. I've recently been thinking about covering up as well.

Marshall Erwin, Head of Trust and Privacy at Mozilla indicates this isn't a perfect solution as your microphone could also be hacked. If you cover up the camera and don't see an indicator light, you'll never know if someone is listening in.

The post provides the following guidance:

* Set strong passwords from your home's wifi router to your devices to your social media accounts

* Be skeptical about links. Be a healthy skeptic as you search and sift online texts.

* Install a security system. Use anti-virus and conduct regular scans to make sure everything is protected.

* Call an expert if you think you've been compromised. Get in touch with an IT professional to try and root out the problem.

** The 4 hour work-week student edition (https://medium.com/@Bradford_Wolf/the-4-hour-work-week-student-edition-61eeea5c38e7#.g3wmj4kn7)

I'm a big fan of ** Tim Ferriss (https://twitter.com/tferriss)

, his ** 4-Hour Workweek book (https://www.amazon.com/4-Hour-Workweek-Escape-Live-Anywhere/dp/0307465357/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1477438420&sr=8-1&keywords=the+4+hour+work+week)

, his ** podcast (http://fourhourworkweek.com/podcast/)

, and ** his new book (https://www.amazon.com/Tools-Titans-Billionaires-World-Class-Performers/dp/1328683788/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8)

based on what he learned during the podcasts. His guidance is one of the main reasons why I've decided to start branching out into other domains in my work. I was first introduced to Ferriss by good friend ** Doug Belshaw (https://twitter.com/dajbelshaw)

.

Because of these reasons, I'm definitely interested in this post by Bradford Wolf, a student of ** Don Wettrick's unlearning class (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4LV6Q5CVqY)

.

I think this post is an interesting piece to share with students in high school or early in their post-secondary work. Please do share, have them complete a quick write to capture their feelings...and then let the discussion begin.

** New Media Consortium releases Digital Literacy: An NMC Horizon Project Strategic Brief (http://www.nmc.org/news/nmc-releases-horizon-project-strategic-brief-on-digital-literacy/)

This new Horizon Report from NMC focuses on digital literacy in classroom instruction. Specifically the report explores the advancement of these new and digital literacies and how best to prepare students for the demands of a global, technological economy.

The report indicates several recommendations for improving digital literacy, but I was most intrigued by their framing of "three models of digital literacy":

* Universal literacy - familiarity with digital texts and tools in office productivity, media manipulation, and content authoring.

* Creative literacy - Includes Universal literacy, but also adds in more challenging skills in video and audio production, website design, and coding/programming.

* Literacy across disciplines - Literacy learning across the disciplines that includes hybrid/blended learning as well as networking/participating in digital spaces.

## 🔨 Do

** Prisma adds art filtered video, GIFs coming next (https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/06/prisma-adds-art-filtered-video-gifs-coming-next/)

If you checked out the video up at the beginning of TL;DR, you're probably interested in playing with apps that will transfer styles in your photos. I've been playing with the ** Prisma (http://prisma-ai.com/)

app for ** iOS (https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0ahUKEwiT-daN1_7PAhUM7SYKHfUUBGcQFggcMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Fprisma-free-photo-editor-art%2Fid1122649984%3Fmt%3D8&usg=AFQjCNHVkl0kX0NskCLqj0jQ07tKXzcj9A&sig2=IvWMvHfYr6p-WtsvlZ7-oQ&bvm=bv.136811127,d.eWE)

and ** Android (https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=5&ved=0ahUKEwiT-daN1_7PAhUM7SYKHfUUBGcQFggzMAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dcom.neuralprisma%26hl%3Den&usg=AFQjCNGkndDy23rm3E_Zx6W-scl9BNKfHw&sig2=bYuQzx-10GH7z3LuxPRjSg&bvm=bv.136811127,d.eWE)

and it is definitely a lot of fun.

I recommend taking a photo that you really like, and then spending about 10 minutes and applying the different filters. I quickly ended up with 10 modified versions of the original that I liked. I then showcased these with my Wife and kids to see what they liked the best.

I'm interested in testing out video soon to see how it all works.
