## 📚 Read

### [School Culture Wars: 'You Have Brought Division to Us'](https://www.nytimes.com/2021-08-18/us/schools-covid-critical-race-theory-masks-gender.html)
From mask mandates to critical race theory and gender identity, educators find themselves besieged by political battles. "You are just trying to keep everything from collapsing," one official observed. Schools face unprecedented challenges: reopening during a highly contagious Delta variant surge while addressing student trauma and maintaining safety protocols.

At this critical moment, school officials are engulfed in highly partisan battles that distract from urgent educational and health priorities. Educators must balance public health requirements, student well-being, and deeply divided community opinions.

### [Parents Are Not Okay](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/08/parents-are-not-okay/619859/)
An honest exploration of pandemic parenting reveals parents operating beyond traditional breaking points. The piece captures the exhaustion and resilience of families navigating unprecedented challenges:

*"Parents aren't even at a breaking point anymore. We're broken. And yet we'll go on because that's what we do: We sweep up all our pieces and put them back together as best we can. We carry on chipped and leaking and broken because we have no other choice."*

This raw honesty reminds us to offer grace and support to those juggling immense responsibilities while maintaining hope for their children's future.

### [What Robots Teach Us About Persuasion](https://www.fastcompany.com/90668496/a-new-study-reveals-what-we-can-learn-about-how-to-persuade-people-from-watching-robots)
Experiments with robot swarms reveal counterintuitive insights about information spread: sporadic social interactions prove more effective than mass communication approaches. Rather than broadcasting messages broadly, targeted interactions with specific individuals create stronger ripple effects throughout networks.

This research offers valuable lessons for educators, leaders, and communicators about the power of personalized, relationship-based approaches to sharing ideas and creating change.

### [9 Apps to Help Kids Sharpen Their Coding Skills](https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/education/learning-to-code/)
Google's education team curated platforms that make coding accessible and engaging for young learners. These tools transform programming from abstract concepts into creative, interactive experiences that build both technical skills and problem-solving abilities.

Coding serves as both an essential future skill and a gateway to computational thinking, creativity, and logical reasoning—all crucial capabilities for navigating an increasingly digital world.

## 🔨 Do

### Navigate Vaccine Conversations with Empathy
Approaching vaccine-hesitant conversations requires patience and understanding rather than confrontation:

- **Check your biases** - Examine your assumptions before engaging
- **Assess openness** - Determine if the person is willing to have a genuine dialogue
- **Maintain kindness** - Keep interactions respectful and civil
- **Identify obstacles** - Understand specific concerns rather than general resistance
- **Use tailored approaches** - Personalize arguments based on individual values and concerns
