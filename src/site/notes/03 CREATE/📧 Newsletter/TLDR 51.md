# TLDR 51

## Too Long; Didn't Read Issue 51

**Published**: 2016-06-25 • [[03 CREATE/📧 Newsletter/📧 Newsletter\|📧 Newsletter]]

Welcome to issue 51 of the TL;DR Newsletter. This week we take a look at connections & growth between individuals.

You can review [archives of the newsletter](http://us11.campaign-archive1.com/home/?u=7b5ee323a16720dad25ff96ff&id=17e92a2ae1). Alternatively you can also [check out TL;DR on Medium](https://medium.com/tldr-newsletter).

I'm writing this newsletter from Denver as I prepare for the [#badgesummit](http://bit.ly/buildingbadges) and a presentation on [#openbadges at #ISTE2016](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VIphqhSV-0Is8sMek_JgUkIYG5VEFlmMhoh7DbVpxQg/edit). I shared a ton of video on [Periscope](https://www.periscope.tv/wiobyrne/) for people that may not be able to attend.

This week I worked on the following:

- [Digitally Literate Courses: Identifying critical friends, a mastermind group, and a name](http://wiobyrne.com/digitally-literate-courses-identifying-critical-friends-a-mastermind-group-and-a-name/) - This latest update for my work in the one side project initiative documents my thinking as I continue to work on a project to scaffold educators in these new and digital literacies.
- [Brian Behlendorf on distributed technologies](http://wiobyrne.com/4q4/2016/brian-behlendorf---hyperledger-and-distributed-technologies-in-educational-settings) - In this latest episode of the [4Q4 podcast](http://wiobyrne.com/4q4/), I spent some time talking with one of the key figures in Linux, Apache, and the open internet.
- [BadgeChain Reads: A Next-Generation Smart Contract and Decentralized Application Platform](http://wiobyrne.com/badgechain-reads-a-next-generation-smart-contract-and-decentralized-application-platform/) - As part of the BadgeChain Team, we're facilitating a collaborative read of works in bitcoin, blockchain...and in this case, Ethereum. Come join us as we use [hypothes.is](http://wiobyrne.com/using-hypothes-is/) to synthesize these works.
- [Chrome extensions to protect you as you search and sift online](http://wiobyrne.com/protect-yourself-as-you-search-and-sift-online-information/) - This post is an update to an earlier piece I shared with guidance on getting a better understanding of ways to protect yourself while you browse online.

## 🔖 Key Takeaways

- **A Good Video to Have in Your Back Pocket**: A good video to have in your back pocket as you discuss these topics with your students.
- **It is My Hope**: It is my hope that this does not lead to more isolationism around the globe. I've noticed that we're seeing a trend in which (some of us) utilize technology to provide third spaces to connect with other like-minded individuals.
- **This is Important**: This is important because we need research and publications testing and validating these new perspectives to make it a tenable element in the eyes of most educators and researchers.
- **I Hope the JAAL Piece Begins That Debate**: One of the big questions that I don't know the answer to, is what effect assessment would have on this model. I hope the JAAL piece begins that debate/discussion.
- **What is Valuable is the Eyes That Light Up**: What is valuable is the eyes that light up in the room as learners see what they can make.

## 📺 Watch

### [What happened before history? Human origins (10:05)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGiQaabX3_o)

This video from the [Kurzgesagt – In a Nutshell YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/Kurzgesagt/videos) documents "how we got to here." The videos on the channel are always thoughtful, and high quality.

This latest video starts with the belief that we're all living in a technological, engineered society in which we don't really need to worry about anything...but it always hasn't been that way. A good video to have in your back pocket as you discuss these topics with your students.

## 📚 Read

### [Brexit vote sparks huge uncertainty for UK universities](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/brexit-vote-sparks-huge-uncertainty-uk-universities)

With the news of the final [brexit vote](http://fusion.net/story/318538/england-brexit-screwed-us-all/), there is a tremendous amount of uncertainty for my friends and colleagues in the UK, but I think the reverberations will be felt globally. This will most definitely be felt in [institutions of higher ed](http://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/news/Pages/statement-on-eu-referendum-outcome.aspx) in the UK and beyond.

It is my hope that this does not lead to more isolationism around the globe. I've noticed that we're seeing a trend in which (some of us) utilize technology to provide third spaces to connect with other like-minded individuals.

### [Research shows connected learning works](http://dmlcentral.net/research-shows-connected-learning-works/?utm_source=maillists.uci.edu&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=DML%2BJune%2BReach)

This post from [Howard Rheingold](https://twitter.com/hrheingold) on the [DML Central blog](http://dmlcentral.net/) shares much needed research on [Connected Learning](http://connectedlearning.tv/what-is-connected-learning).

The research includes thousands of interviews and years of data-gathering that suggest that connected learning principles do, in fact, improve learning outcomes — particularly in the case of non-dominant youth. This work will be [presented at DML 2016](https://dml2016.sched.org/event/7Ekt).

This is important because we need research and publications testing and validating these new perspectives to make it a tenable element in the eyes of most educators and researchers.

### [Do I own my own domain if you grade it?](http://www.edsurge.com/news/2015-08-10-do-i-own-my-domain-if-you-grade-it)

Much of my recent work examines building up a domain of your own. This work is crystallized in a series of publications we have on the way out soon. You can take a peek at [an upcoming column for JAAL here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K65rAI4HJd3aE49pRtKKp5kwyNfBpzucLx2F_XYgL94/edit?usp=sharing).

In the JAAL column above, Kristy Pytash and I make the case that we should have students build a domain of their own from K up through higher ed. One of the big questions that I don't know the answer to, is what effect assessment would have on this model. I hope the JAAL piece begins that debate/discussion.

### [How to Manage the 4 Types of Teachers You Meet in Professional Development](http://www.edsurge.com/news/2016-06-16-how-to-manage-the-4-types-of-teachers-you-meet-in-professional-development)

For those of us involved in professional development, workshops, and coaching we often come across all sorts of educators in these spaces.

I often recognize this as I present sessions on technology and literacy. I prepare for some part of the group loving what I'll have to share...and another portion that thinks it's blasphemy and lashes out. :)

I attribute much of this to the fact that literacy and technology are changing what we could/should do in our classrooms. What I have to present usually tests your philosophies and paradigms about teaching and learning.

This post does a good job of framing these into four profiles (the lagger, the majority, the early adopter, the innovator). I think you need to recognize and respect each of these individuals in your sessions.

### [Librarian Approved: 30 Ed-Tech Apps to Inspire Creativity and Creation](http://ww2.kqed.org/mindshift/2016/06/22/librarian-approved-30-ed-tech-apps-to-inspire-creativity-and-creation/)

Great collection of apps to test drive in your classroom from [Michelle Luhtala](https://twitter.com/mluhtala). You should also follow [Michelle's blog](http://mluhtala.blogspot.com/).

Of her recommendations, I'm most intrigued by [Bloxels](http://www.bloxelsbuilder.com/), [Gum](http://justgum.it/), and [Masterpiece](https://www.playosmo.com/en/masterpiece/).

## 🔨 Do

### [Blinky paper robot - paper circuitry project](http://www.instructables.com/id/Blinky-Paper-Robot-1st-Paper-Circuit-Project/)

I love having students and teachers play and make things with LEDs and paper. The materials you'll need are relatively inexpensive (watch batteries, copper tape, and LEDs). The time spent to make these pieces is minimal. What is valuable is the eyes that light up in the room as learners see what they can make.

## 🤔 Consider

> "Be a yardstick of quality. Some people aren't used to an environment where excellence is expected." — Steve Jobs

This week: connections and growth between individuals.

Writing from Denver for Badge Summit and ISTE2016, shared Periscope videos for remote attendees. Brian Behlendorf 4Q4 podcast on distributed technologies, BadgeChain Ethereum collaborative read. Kurzgesagt on human origins - good video to have in your back pocket. Brexit uncertainty for UK universities - my hope is this doesn't lead to more isolationism. Howard Rheingold on connected learning research - important to validate new perspectives. Domain of one's own and assessment question - I hope JAAL piece begins debate. Four types of teachers in PD - recognize and respect each. Michelle Luhtala ed-tech apps. Blinky paper robots - what's valuable is the eyes that light up.

Be a yardstick of quality.
