Welcome to _Digitally Literate_ 403. This week we're exploring a modern paradox. The internet rewards visibility while punishing those who become visible. Whether you're building a career, sharing expertise, or just trying to connect with others, being online has become essential, and increasingly dangerous.

## 🔖 Key Takeaways

- **The Visibility Bind**: Professional and personal success increasingly requires online presence, but visibility attracts harassment
- **Toxic by Design**: Platforms that reward engagement often amplify the most hostile voices
- **The Harassment Playbook**: What started with Gamergate has become the template for silencing voices across all topics
- **Unequal Risk**: Women and marginalized voices face disproportionate abuse for the same level of online participation

## 🎭 The "Extremely Online" Dilemma
Being "[extremely online](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremely_online)" used to be internet slang for people who lived mostly in digital spaces. [Now it describes](https://reallifemag.com/issue-extremely-online/) anyone who's deeply engaged with internet culture and believes online conversations matter. That includes most of us trying to build careers, share knowledge, or connect with communities.

But here's the trap: the more visible you become online, the more likely you are to become a target. Success in digital spaces requires engagement, but engagement brings exposure, and exposure attracts those who see your visibility as a threat to their worldview.

## 📈 The Visibility Imperative

Like it or not, [having an online presence has become essential for professional success](https://topstackgroup.com/how-social-media-affects-job-opportunities/). Whether you're a teacher sharing lesson plans, a small business owner connecting with customers, or a professional building your reputation, [digital visibility opens doors](https://www.ofe.ca/post/optimizing-your-digital-presence-for-career-success) that remain closed to those who stay offline.

[Research shows](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000187912030021X) that people with active online profiles get more opportunities, better networking connections, and [increased recognition in their fields](https://hbr.org/2022/08/strengthen-your-professional-presence-on-social-media). But this creates a cruel irony, the very visibility that advances your career also exposes you to harassment that can destroy it.

## 👾 The Gamergate Blueprint

In 2014, a harassment campaign called [Gamergate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamergate) targeted women in gaming under the pretense of "ethics in journalism." But [Gamergate wasn't really about ethics](https://www.poynter.org/ethics-trust/2025/what-was-gamergate-controversy-ethics-games-journalism/). It was about using coordinated online attacks to silence voices that challenged the status quo.

[That playbook has now spread far beyond gaming](https://libres.uncg.edu/ir/asu/f/Perreault_Gregory_2016_GamerGate%20Controversy%20and%20Journalistic.pdf). The pattern is always the same:

- Weaponize legitimate concerns as cover for personal attacks
- Coordinate harassment across multiple platforms
- Target women and marginalized voices disproportionately
- Cause enough professional damage to silence critics

Whether it's attacking climate scientists, journalists, public health experts, or anyone speaking up about social issues, the tactics remain consistent. What started as harassment of women in gaming became the template for online abuse across every topic.

## ⚡ When Platforms Reward Toxicity

Social media platforms claim they want healthy discourse, but their algorithms often do the opposite. Engagement-driven design amplifies content that provokes strong reactions. This often means [the angriest, most divisive voices](https://www.promarket.org/2025/07/16/how-toxic-content-drives-user-engagement-on-social-media/) get the biggest audiences.

[Research suggests](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/news/2025/2/toxic_content_and_social_media_user_engagement__are_we_our_own_worst_enemies/) that people who engage in online political discussions are often uncivil largely because the people who opt into it are generally uncivil. Platforms attract users who are toxic across all topics, not just controversial ones. This means that [even neutral professional content can attract hostile responses](https://www.ipr.northwestern.edu/news/2023/why-are-online-political-discussions-so-toxic.html).

The result is that thoughtful, nuanced voices get drowned out by those willing to be loudest and most aggressive. Platforms that could facilitate meaningful conversation [instead become battlegrounds](https://knightcolumbia.org/content/the-algorithmic-management-of-polarization-and-violence-on-social-media) where the most extreme positions dominate.

## 🎯 Unequal Consequences
The risks of online visibility aren't distributed equally. [Women report experiencing significantly more gender-based harassment](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6635696/) than men for the same level of online participation. Marginalized voices face coordinated attacks that can include doxxing, threats, and attempts to get them fired from their jobs.

[The psychological toll is severe](https://academic.oup.com/bjsw/article/54/7/3274/7690180). Online harassment leads to anxiety, depression, sleep problems, and difficulty concentrating. For many, it means [withdrawing from online spaces entirely](https://www.sciencespo.fr/ecole-affaires-publiques/sites/sciencespo.fr.ecole-affaires-publiques/files/DENG.pdf). Exactly what the harassment was designed to achieve.

This creates a vicious cycle. The voices most needed in online discourse are the ones most likely to be driven out of it.

## 🛡️ Strategies for Safer Engagement

While there's no perfect protection against online harassment, [there are ways to reduce risk](https://advocacy.consumerreports.org/press_release/treat-online-abuse-like-spam-new-report-urges-social-media-platforms-to-fight-online-abuse-with-tools-users-can-control/) while maintaining necessary online presence:

**Strategic Platform Selection**: Don't try to be everywhere. Choose platforms that align with your goals and have better moderation policies.

**Professional Boundaries**: Separate personal and professional digital identities. Share strategically, not compulsively.

**Community Building**: Connect with others who share your values. Supportive networks can provide crucial backup when harassment begins.

**Documentation**: Keep records of harassment. Platforms are more likely to act when presented with clear evidence.

**Institutional Support**: If you're affiliated with an organization, make sure they understand the risks you face and have your back.

## 🌐 The Bigger Picture

The online visibility trap reflects deeper questions about how we structure digital discourse. Should participation in online conversation require [accepting the risk of harassment](https://provost.psu.edu/guide-to-managing-online-harassment/)? How do we [balance free speech with protection from coordinated abuse](https://bipartisanpolicy.org/blog/academic-freedom-social-media/)?

The answers matter for everyone, not just those building careers online. As more of our social, professional, and civic life moves to digital spaces, the health of online discourse affects the health of our democracy.

## 🤔 Consider

>  We are at a proverbial fork in the road. One route leads an ever deeper downward spiral into digital dystopia: hyper-surveillance, predictive technology working hand in hand with authoritarianism, disinformation overload and proliferating online divisiveness and hatred. The alternative route is a more-regulated internet where accountability matters, guided by a commonly assented ethics of public culture. 
>  
>  Is this alternative possible in an era of winner-takes-all partisanship and corporate greed so vast that it is literally interplanetary in its ambitions? I fear not, but if we are to be civic optimists then it is the only possible hope, and we have no alternative but to say 'yes' to a better digital future and to become digital activists who collectively work to make it happen.

> — Mark Davis, cited [here](https://hyp.is/9NHJ4pFtEfCFj2di63gAtQ/www.elon.edu/u/imagining/surveys/xiii-2021/improving-toxic-online-forums-2035/)

The internet promised to democratize information and give everyone a voice. But if only those willing to accept harassment can safely speak up, we've created a different kind of gatekeeping, one where the loudest and most aggressive voices shape the conversation.

This isn't about perfect online safety, which is impossible. It's about creating digital spaces where meaningful participation doesn't require accepting abuse as the price of admission.
