# TLDR 134

## Too Long; Didn't Read Issue 134

**Published**: 2018-01-26 • [[03 CREATE/📧 Newsletter/📧 Newsletter\|📧 Newsletter]]

Welcome to Issue 134. Friend or foe, poison or detox.

As a reminder, last week we rebooted the [Digitally Literate Research Project](http://digitallyliterate.net/). This is an open research project in which we're studying the use of technology in instruction around the globe. Our survey is in English and available [here](http://digitallyliterate.net/tltsurvey/). If you're an educator in Pre-K up through higher ed...especially in international audiences...please take/share this.

This week I posted the following:
- [Take the time to review & reinforce your digital hygiene](http://wiobyrne.com/digital-hygiene/) - This post is the synthesis of my earlier series of posts on ensuring your privacy and security online.
- [Where I'm from](https://medium.com/rps-2k18/where-im-from-8240c3c48575) - As part of my slam poetry class, students spent this week writing about where they're from and will post to our [Medium pub](https://medium.com/rps-2k18). In these activities, I'm remixing some of the learning events from our previous work with the [Walk My World project](http://walkmy.world/).
- [Challenges in localization of research](http://digitallyliterate.net/localization-of-research/) - This post is a researcher note from our work on the Digitally Literate Research Project.
- Video: [Two ways to use Hypothesis for reading, research, & response](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTYSxfvcong)
- Video: [Theoretical perspectives & contexts of language development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEt3w7-O7lY&t=1s)

Please [subscribe](http://wiobyrne.us11.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=7b5ee323a16720dad25ff96ff&id=17e92a2ae1) to make sure this comes to your inbox each week.

- **AI Deepfakes Creating Dangerous Reality**: Machine learning and AI systems can now synthesize anyone's facial expressions and gestures from video clips, creating convincing face-swapped videos—app allows superimposing celebrity faces onto porn performers for free compared to $200 million CGI, raising urgent concerns about revenge porn and very real fake news propaganda.
- **Tech Executives Don't Use Own Products**: Facebook developers admitted designing platform to be addictive yet many tech titans are very careful about how they privately use tech and extent to which they allow their kids access to screens and apps—revealing "never get high on your own supply" mentality where executives won't let their own children use products they call "greatest of all time."
- **Digital Detox Reduces Environmental Toxicity**: Middlebury DLINQ initiative seeks to reduce toxicity of personal digital environments and how we engage with them through developing critical habits that improve overall well-being and reduce risks to personal digital data—bi-weekly newsletters provide information and activities for reality check if you or loved one spends too much time plugged in.

### [5 tips for being an ally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dg86g-QlM0)

We've talked a bit about unpacking privilege and the challenges of advocating for others. One word that increasingly comes up in this is the term "ally." I've heard it pop up in some recent research, and in talks with students in class.

This week I attended a "Safe Zone" training here on campus, and one of the pieces that we started to unpack in this session is identifying exactly what is an ally, and what are the expectations of this role.

This video by Chescaleigh provides a great overview of what is involved in being an ally. Take the time to educate yourself.

### [We are truly f****d: Everyone is making AI-generated fake porn now](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/bjye8a/reddit-fake-porn-app-daisy-ridley)

Please be advised this story contains content that is NSFW. In short, it talks about PORN.

This story in [Motherboard](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us) talks about an app that allows you to superimpose someone's face onto another person's body. For now, this app is being used to superimpose celebrity faces onto the bodies of porn performers.

Through machine learning and artificial intelligence, a system is able to copy and even synthesize anyone's facial expressions and gestures if given enough visual data like video clips. The face-swapped videos may not look 100 percent real, but they're convincing enough.

The photo I shared above is an example of this work. The top image of Carrie Fisher is the CGI version that cost $200 million to make in a movie studio. The bottom image is created using this app for free.

You can click through the article to find the app, associated subreddit community, and more examples of this work. This work is still very new, and is becoming more sophisticated. It raises questions about the impact of this on ["revenge porn" or very real "fake news" and propaganda](https://www.bustle.com/p/a-fake-porn-app-lets-people-put-celebrities-faces-in-videos-heres-why-its-so-dangerous-8011788).

### ["Never get high on your own supply" - why social media bosses don't use social media](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/jan/23/never-get-high-on-your-own-supply-why-social-media-bosses-dont-use-social-media?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other)

Much has been made about the role of social media, and the possible negative effects of these spaces on our lives.

It's interesting to consider that Facebook developers have recently admitted that they designed the platform to be addictive. This extends to a larger context where we consider the impact on civil discourse in society. How does this all impact our ability to cooperate, deal with misinformation, or simply connect?

This piece by [Alex Hern](https://twitter.com/alexhern) in The Guardian looks at addiction, these digital products, and the reticence of their executives to actually use the platforms.

Hern posits:

> Many tech titans are very, very careful about how they privately use tech and how they allow their kids to use it and the extent to which they allow their kids access to screens and various apps and programs," says Alter. "They will get up on stage, some of them, and say things like: 'This is the greatest product of all time,' but then when you delve you see they don't allow their kids access to that same product.

### [Digital Learning & Inquiry (DLINQ) Digital Detox 2018](http://dlinq.middcreate.net/digitaldetox/)

I've been working on my own series of posts looking at cleaning up your digital hygiene at the start of a new year. But, perhaps you're more interesting carving out some headspace and going on a detox from these digital signals that inundate our lives.

The Digital Detox is an initiative that seeks to "reduce the toxicity of our personal digital environments and how we engage with them". They strive to help you counteract these forces by helping you develop critical habits that will improve your overall well-being and reduce risks to your personal digital data.

They are about 3/4 of the way through the month, but you can still up to review the bi-weekly newsletters they've been sending out that include information and activities to help you detox. You can also read all of their previous newsletters on the website linked above. This is a great reality check if you think you (or a loved one) spends too much time plugged in.

### [It's time to shatter the silence about race](http://hechingerreport.org/teacher-voice-time-shatter-silence-race/)

This piece in The Hechinger Report by [Sonja Cherry-Paul](https://litlearnact.wordpress.com/sonja-cherry-paul/) originally appeared in the January/February 2018 issue of [Literacy Today](https://www.literacyworldwide.org/get-resources/em-literacy-today-em-magazine), the member magazine of the [International Literacy Association](https://www.literacyworldwide.org/).

Cherry-Paul indicates five steps you can take to foster change, and addressing racism in schools:

- Build a safe space
- Establish a unified vision
- Create an action plan
- Identify goals
- Partner with parents

### [Even Burger King is roasting Ajit Pai over net neutrality repeal](https://gizmodo.com/even-burger-king-is-roasting-ajit-pai-over-net-neutrali-1822380669#ampshare=https://gizmodo.com/even-burger-king-is-roasting-ajit-pai-over-net-neutrali-1822380669)

Brands usually don't get involved in politics and publicly take sides on an issue. They usually do not want to risk alienating a portion of their customers due to partisan issues.

Most Americans [support](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2017/06/06/new-mozilla-poll-americans-political-parties-overwhelmingly-support-net-neutrality/) net neutrality because most understand that it's not a good idea to allow Internet service providers to pick and choose the content they might want to block or throttle. And if they don't understand it at first, they tend to do so once they get a little information.

Once again, this issue of net neutrality is a hard one to understand. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=3&v=ltzy5vRmN8Q), from Burger King, a global chain of hamburger fast food restaurants is most likely the best explanation of net neutrality that I've seen.

[Kaizena](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/kaizena/kfcmpbkmmdlcnepmeojihblcllopielg?hl=en) is a free add-on for Google Docs that makes it easy to add comments to your materials. In a recent update to the tool, they streamlined the ability to add voice notes so you don't have to leave your document. This is a good way to leave verbal feedback, or a think aloud to your work, or student work.
