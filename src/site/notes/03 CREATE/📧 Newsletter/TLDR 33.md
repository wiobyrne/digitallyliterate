** Too Long; Didn't Read (TL;DR) newsletter #33

------------------------------------------------------------

Hi all. Welcome to the TL;DR Newsletter.

This week we do some thinking about introverts, empathy, and authenticity.

These posts from my readings and work this week in literacy, technology. You may have come across this newsletter by accident. If you subscribe (http://wiobyrne.us11.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=7b5ee323a16720dad25ff96ff&id=17e92a2ae1) ...a wonderful thing happens. I go home and tell my children. We weep ecstatically as we consider how lucky we are to live in a world where people like you subscribe to newsletters like this. :)

And now, on to updates. This week I shared the following:

* Digital Portfolios + Open Badges + Blockchain = Personal Learning Ledger (http://wiobyrne.com/digital-portfolios-open-badges-blockchain-personal-learning-ledger/) - This post is something I pulled together to crystalize my thoughts as I continue to work with an amazing group on blockchain technologies and open badges.

* Preparing Students to Be Literate Digitally in a Digitally Literate Environment (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xZ4qpRz4i8pi6bHTYO8U9ujfDYbxGJC5sHRj2ULOF4M/edit) - This is a submission to JAAL which we'd love for you to comment on. It expands on our thinking in the post above.

* Creative Commons licensing of open educational content (https://medium.com/advocat-ed/creative-commons-licensing-of-open-educational-content-8aa1302019b#.wbta5qm9r) - A thorough overview of CC licensing, and where to find content online.

* How to find Creative Commons licensed images and cite them correctly (http://wiobyrne.com/how-to-find-creative-commons-licensed-images-and-cite-them-correctly/) - I put this post together for students that needed explicit advice on how to find and then cite CC licensed images in their blog posts.

* Post, promote, and protect your content online using Creative Commons licensing (https://medium.com/advocat-ed/post-promote-and-protect-your-content-online-using-creative-commons-licensing-52d87e44b850#.uqnixsgjb) - This post is a revised piece that I submitted earlier. It is an overview of the how and why you'll want to share your content under a CC license.

* Shape of my story (http://walkmy.world/start-walking/walk2016/le4/) - This week we launched Learning Event 4 in #WalkMyWorld 2016. Take a look at the post and come join us online.

* Syndicating (republishing or broadcasting) your blog posts to Medium (http://wiobyrne.com/syndicating-republishing-or-broadcasting-your-blog-posts-to-medium/) - This is a guide for colleagues and students that were looking for some support as they built up a writing platform on Medium.

## 📚 Read

** We're not as open-minded as we think we are (http://lifehacker.com/were-not-as-open-minded-as-we-think-you-are-1759787196)

Excellent post from ** Thorin Klosowski (https://twitter.com/kingthor)

at ** Lifehacker (http://lifehacker.com/)

looking at the ways in which we challenge our beliefs and biases as we interact in the world. Often times it is our own preconceptions that get in the way when we try to listen to others.

I think the first step might be acknowledging and accounting for our own bias.

** Strategies to ensure introverted students feel valued at school (http://ww2.kqed.org/mindshift/2016/02/19/strategies-to-ensure-introverted-students-feel-valued-at-school/)

Over the past couple of months I've been a bit more cognizant of the mindsets and dispositions of others as I work with them. Specifically, I spend much of my time as a literacy or technology instructor and coax/goad students into getting online and creating a digital identity.

One of the retorts that I receive is that I'm brave and I have no fear as I share things online. I am also aware of the challenges of individuals as they are concerned about privacy/security online and their identity. I'm also starting to become a bit more aware of individuals in my classes that might be introverted, and how do I support them as learners.

After some talk with ** Eylan Ezekiel (https://twitter.com/eylanezekiel)

, I'm thinking that I need to build time into the schedule for students to decompress and recharge. If you're interested in more info...please reach out to Eylan on Twitter for more ideas.

**  ways to launch your Genius Hour projects to the world (http://ajjuliani.com/5-ways-to-launch-your-genius-hour-projects-to-the-world/)

A blog post from A. J. Juliani looking at the ** Genius Hour (http://www.edutopia.org/groups/personalized-learning/802456)

and building up opportunities to engage and empower students.

The Genius Hour is an offshoot from the ** 20% Time Project (http://www.20time.org/)

. This builds in critical time to the classroom that gives students a chance to engage in projects and learning of their own interests.

The three components to focus on include: Student Choice, Authentic Audience, and Intrinsic Reward.

I know what this looks like in K-12...I'm wondering if we could make it happen with adults outside of the classroom...

** Plagiarism is dead; Long live the retweet: Unpacking an identity crisis in digital content (http://www.digitalpedagogylab.com/hybridped/plagiarism-is-dead-long-live-the-retweet/)

Great post colleague and friend Susanne Murphy looking at the challenges between content creation, ownership, remix culture, and "credit" in the online space.

I shared this out online and many people indicated that this is a post that is perfect for an annotation tool like ** Hypothes.is (https://hypothes.is/)

.

Susanne's wit and writing are cultivated, nuanced, and deep. Take the time to annotate and appreciate this post.

** ow Tim Cook, in iPhone battle, became a bulwark for digital privacy (http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/19/technology/how-tim-cook-became-a-bulwark-for-digital-privacy.html)

If you're a regular reader of TL;DR, you'd expect this post to go first. Perhaps it's ** the playlist I'm listening to (https://open.spotify.com/user/goodkingthor/playlist/5fLSfBPlZYXvYv4DQHtNGm)

, perhaps it's the weather...but I wanted to save this for last.

While I was at LRA this past December, the ** shootings occurred nearby in San Bernardino (http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/03/us/san-bernardino-shooting.html)

. This past week, the FBI publicly brought a federal order to Apple to unlock the iPhone of one of the gunmen. Apple not only is saying no...but they're also publicly reaching out to the public to gain support/traction.

I think this is big news. I think there is more at stake here as well. Yes, the cynic in me thinks that it's a PR ploy. It also might be different if the federal order was presented privately. There is a lot that we don't see, hear, or know about what it happening.

It is (and will be) interesting to see how this plays out over the coming weeks. Something to read up on...and pay attention to.

## 🔨 Do

** Making Soundscapes: The HearMyHome Project (http://dogtrax.edublogs.org/2016/02/15/making-soundscapes-the-hearmyhome-project/)

The ** HearMyHome Project (http://hearmyhome.matrix.msu.edu/)

is a cool research project from ** Jon Wargo (https://twitter.com/wargojon)

and ** Cassie Brownell (https://twitter.com/brownellcassie)

.

The project focuses on:

Examining everyday people produced soundscapes, #hearmyhome inquires how hearing difference and listening to communities may re-educate the senses and attune us towards cultural difference. Ultimately developing materials that hear, recognize, and sustain community literacies and cultural rhetorics, #hearmyhome asks us to take heed of the frequencies and rhythms of culture as we architect, design, and teach towards more equitable landscapes for learning.

The link at the top of this post is from the work that ** Kevin Hodgson (https://twitter.com/dogtrax)

shared for the project. The ** awesome image up top (https://www.flickr.com/photos/dogtrax/24387197724/in/dateposted/)

is from Kevin as well.

## 🤔 Consider

You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view...until you climb inside of his skin and walk around in it.
