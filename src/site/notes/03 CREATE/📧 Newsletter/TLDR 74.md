## 🔖 Key Takeaways

- **I've Often Said**: I've often said that "I'm a visual learner," but research suggests that learning styles like visual and auditory learning are inherent traits. This doesn't entirely mean that learners don't have preferences, but we must begin to question whether people actually learned better when information was presented in a preferred style. Instead, it seems that most people learn the best when information is presented in multiple ways, especially when one of them is visual.
- **One of My Favorite Lines**: What literature does is incorporate the other in all its quirks and peculiarities into the social body. It allows for difference, and often even proclaims it to be genius. It considers difference a sign of courage: the hero is who he chooses to be.
- **I've Had Some Deep Thinking**: Over the past week I've had some deep thinking about my own perspectives, voice, and right to speak my mind about some of the events I see unfolding. If you spent any time with me while at LRA, I shared some of these thoughts in varied discussions. I had hoped that we could unpack some of these challenges in larger group activities to understand and celebrate one another. I'm still looking for actionable guidance as to how we can build these connections.
- **I Think These Perspectives**: I think these perspectives have tremendous value for educators from Pre-K up through higher ed. Specifically, I think the internet and other communication technologies present opportunities for individuals to think about new opportunities to read, write, and communicate with others.
- **I've Spent a Lot of Time**: I've spent a lot of time teaching students about the challenges of developing maps. This video makes it very easy to understand by cutting up a giant beach ball map.

## 📺 Watch

### [Am I really a visual learner?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-S_53HmEUA)

I've often said that "I'm a visual learner," but research suggests that [learning styles like visual and auditory learning](https://ww2.kqed.org/mindshift/2012/04/13/do-students-have-different-learning-styles/) are inherent traits.

This doesn't entirely mean that learners don't have preferences, but we must begin to question whether people actually learned better when information was presented in a preferred style. Instead, it seems that most people learn the best when information is presented in multiple ways, especially when one of them is visual.

## 📚 Read

### [The need to read](http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-need-to-read-1480083086)

Great post from [Will Schwalbe](https://twitter.com/WillSch) in the Wall Street Journal. This article focuses on the specific needs for reading. These include opportunities for individuals to engage with the world, become a better reader, and make sense of challenges in life.

Schwalbe indicates the need for reading in our current times:

> We overschedule our days and complain constantly about being too busy. We shop endlessly for stuff we don't need and then feel oppressed by the clutter that surrounds us. We rarely sleep well or enough. We compare our bodies to the artificial ones we see in magazines and our lives to the exaggerated ones we see on television. We watch cooking shows and then eat fast food. We worry ourselves sick and join gyms we don't visit. We keep up with hundreds of acquaintances but rarely see our best friends. We bombard ourselves with video clips and emails and instant messages. We even interrupt our interruptions.

### [Divided times: How literature teaches us to understand the other](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/dec/02/literature-teaches-us-to-understand-the-other)

A post from Amanda Michalopoulou examining the possible role of literature, and more specifically drama in helping help us develop empathy.

One of my favorite lines from the post:

> What literature does is incorporate the other in all its quirks and peculiarities into the social body. It allows for difference, and often even proclaims it to be genius. It considers difference a sign of courage: the hero is who he chooses to be.

### [Donald Trump, the first President of our post-literate age](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-11-29/donald-trump-the-first-president-of-our-post-literate-age)

A thoughtful, nuanced post from [Joe Weisenthal](https://twitter.com/TheStalwart) examining the literacy practices that exist as we focus on medium and not message in our current times. Weisenthal posits that may people would rather act on emotion and resonate with the short form immediate communication bursts that Trump effectively utilized.

The closing paragraph:

> Furthermore, the world is still an extremely long way from eliminating classical, written literacy. We can still look up something in a dictionary or Wikipedia. You can still experience solitude, getting lost in the deep stacks of a library, meticulously poring over authoritative documents word for word. But as information gets more social -- taking on the immediate, short-form characteristics of Facebook and Twitter -- it acquires more qualities of the oral world.

### [Now is the time to talk about what we are actually talking about](http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/now-is-the-time-to-talk-about-what-we-are-actually-talking-about)

Powerful piece from [Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie](https://twitter.com/adichiespeaks) highlighting the need for honest talk about perspectives, empathy, and humanity.

Over the past week I've had some deep thinking about my own perspectives, voice, and right to speak my mind about some of the events I see unfolding. If you spent any time with me while at LRA, I shared some of these thoughts in varied discussions. I had hoped that we could unpack some of these challenges in larger group activities to understand and celebrate one another. I'm still looking for actionable guidance as to how we can build these connections.

### [5 ways to think, and act, like a digital technology leader](http://www.forbes.com/sites/joemckendrick/2016/11/18/5-ways-to-think-and-act-like-a-digital-technology-leader/#11700d5f72a3)

[Joe McKendrick](https://twitter.com/@joemckendrick) in Forbes identifying a series of perspectives as you think and act more like a leader in technology. He presents five perspectives:

- Think like a chief executive officer
- Think like a journalist
- Think like an educator
- Think like an entrepreneur
- Think like a radical

I think these perspectives have tremendous value for educators from Pre-K up through higher ed. Specifically, I think the internet and other communication technologies present opportunities for individuals to think about new opportunities to read, write, and communicate with others.

## 🔨 Do

### [Why all world maps are wrong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIID5FDi2JQ)

A great video from the Vox YouTube channel examining the challenges that exist as we create maps of the globe. I've spent a lot of time teaching students about the challenges of developing maps. This video makes it very easy to understand by cutting up a giant beach ball map.
