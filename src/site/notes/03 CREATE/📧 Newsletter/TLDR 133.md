# TLDR 133

## Too Long; Didn't Read Issue 133

**Published**: 2018-01-19 • [[03 CREATE/📧 Newsletter/📧 Newsletter\|📧 Newsletter]]

Welcome to Issue 133. Helping you get your fill.

This week I rebooted the [Digitally Literate Research Project](http://digitallyliterate.net/). This is an open research project in which we're studying the use of technology in instruction around the globe. Our survey is in English and available [here](http://digitallyliterate.net/tltsurvey/). If you're an educator in Pre-K up through higher ed...especially in international audiences...please take/share this. Also, we're building a small cadre of bloggers that want to think and write about edu, tech, open, and everything in between...please send me an email to join us.

This week I posted the following:
- [Protect your connection to the Internet](http://wiobyrne.com/protect-your-connection/) - This post talks about updating (or upgrading your router and possibly using a VPN. This is one of the posts in my series of posts on reviewing your digital hygiene at the start of a new year.
- [Encrypt your devices](http://wiobyrne.com/encrypt-your-devices/) - This post shares guidance on why and how to encrypt your devices to protect your data. This is the last of my posts on reviewing your digital hygiene. Next week I will share one post linking to all of the posts.
- [Lyrics, Performance, & Power](http://wiobyrne.com/lyrics-performance-power/) - I'm teaching a course on slam poetry this semester and as part of this, I'm crowd sourcing a [playlist of songs/performances](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLX2wkComb6imDUHvwk_IMsqujkCmYAzwi) that include powerful lyrics, and a powerful presentation of these lyrics. Please share pieces you think should be included.

## 🔖 Key Takeaways

- **Poe Should Be Read Aloud**: Neil Gaiman reading "The Raven" for Edgar Allan Poe's birthday demonstrates poetry's power when performed vocally—Poe was regular fixture in 8th grade classroom and needs more room in building literate homes for children who deserve experiencing literature through multiple modalities.
- **Cookie Company Wants Fewer Cookies**: Farhad Manjoo's brilliant analogy asks what sort of cookie company wants people to eat fewer cookies—Facebook's news feed overhaul trying to make addictive free cookies less addictive by adding carrots and kale exposes fundamental contradictions in platform's business model built on maximizing engagement.
- **Democracy-Poisoning Golden Age of Free Speech**: Zeynep Tufekci argues networked environment creating opposite of free speech utopia—marginalized voices struggle to be heard while negativity goes viral through dark ads, propaganda, and unseen money shifting online sands, requiring better way forward for democracy.
- **Trust in Media at All-Time Low**: Knight Foundation report reveals changing dynamics of trust in sociopolitical ecosystems, encapsulating same message unpacked in TL;DR for months about effects of literacy practices in online and hybrid spaces and how they impact offline interactions—struggle exists deciding whether to be citizens with neighbors or in globally connected marketplace.
- **Inviting Controversy Requires Pedagogical Skill**: Philip Russell's granular advice for bringing controversial topics into classrooms sparks dialogue about educator appropriateness—challenge exists helping youth make sense of societal turmoil when parents and possibly teachers don't know how to cope with these times themselves.
- **Humans Strategic Machines Tactical**: Future of human work requires imagination, creativity, and strategic thinking harder to automate—technology should boost productivity not cut workforce, with wise leaders understanding how to integrate new technology into workflow while coping with feelings that it's somehow "the enemy."

## 📺 Watch

### [The Raven by Edgar Allan Poe, read by Neil Gaiman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jSHKPp-66w)

January 19th is Edgar Allan Poe's birthday.

Neil Gaiman suggested that [Edgar Allan Poe should be read aloud](https://boingboing.net/2009/01/19/gaiman-on-poe-read-h.html). He recorded this video of him reading "The Raven" in 2016 as part of Pat Rothfuss's Worldbuilders charity drive.

Poe is a favorite of mine, and was a regular fixture in my 8th grade classroom. I need to find more room for him in my life as I build a literate home for my children.

### [The difficulties with Facebook's news feed overhaul](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/12/technology/facebook-news-feed-overhaul.html)

In [TL;DR #132](http://mailchi.mp/5731a3548a1b/tldr-132), I hinted at the upcoming changes that supposedly were coming to your Facebook feed. [Farhad Manjoo](https://twitter.com/fmanjoo) takes this subject on with his usual savvy wit. I'm including the opening from his piece as it is a perfect analogy of the societal problems we're having.

> Imagine you're a cookie mogul. You figured out a way to make lots of money by giving away delicious cookies for free, and in less than a decade, you created a global cookie behemoth.
>
> But recently your cookie kingdom has begun to crumble. Scientists are worried that people are eating so many of your cookies that they're making themselves sick — yet they keep eating more, because who can say no to free cookies? There are concerns that your cookies are crowding out the market for normal food; after your success, fruit and vegetable companies have pivoted to free cookies, and now much of the global food supply is just cookies. Rising cookie addiction might even have helped a foreign government influence your country's election.
>
> So you decide to do something. You convene your best bakers, and you tell them, look, from now on, we don't just care about how many free cookies we can shove into people's gullets. We want to take a holistic look at the overall cookie experience. We want people to eat some cookies, sure, but we don't want them to eat too many, so we will have to make our free cookies less addictive and more "meaningful." Let's maybe put carrots and kale and broccoli in the cookies.
>
> What sort of cookie company wants people to eat fewer cookies?

### [It's the (democracy-poisoning) golden age of free speech](https://www.wired.com/story/free-speech-issue-tech-turmoil-new-censorship/)

With the advent of these new and digital technologies, many think there is an opportunity to enable freedom of speech, and likewise the empowerment of all due to global connectivity. As indicated by [Zeynep Tufecki](https://twitter.com/zeynep) in this piece in Wired:

> In today's networked environment, when anyone can broadcast live or post their thoughts to a social network, it would seem that censorship ought to be impossible. This should be the golden age of free speech.

Yet, we appear to be witnessing the opposite effect. We see marginalized voices having a hard time being heard. We see things going viral, it seems, simply because they are negative. We see dark ads, propaganda, and unseen monies shifting the sands online.

There has to be a better way.

### [10 reasons why American trust in the media is at an all-time low](https://medium.com/trust-media-and-democracy/10-reasons-why-americans-dont-trust-the-media-d0630c125b9e)

This post from the [Knight Foundation](https://knightfoundation.org/) reports of the changing dynamics of trust in our sociopolitical ecosystems. The post shares an overview of the full report, [available here](https://knightfoundation.org/reports/american-views-trust-media-and-democracy).

I'm sharing this for two reasons. The first is that it encapsulates much of the same message that we've been unpacking here in TL;DR for months. That is, what are the effects of these literacy practices in online and hybrid spaces...and how do they impact our offline interactions as citizens. It seems we have a struggle that exists as we decide whether we want to be citizens with others in our neighborhoods, or citizens in a globally connected marketplace.

More importantly, take some time to go look at the design aesthetics of the post. I've been focused on making my materials more approachable and accessible for all individuals. This post, sharing the highlights of their research, is a good exemplar.

### [Inviting controversy into the classroom](https://www.cultofpedagogy.com/controversy/)

In one of my research projects, I'm studying local activist groups to understand how they use digital texts and tools to achieve their goals. In these discussions, I've been asking about the role of educators in these practices and how they can help youth make sense of the turmoil in society. This is a challenge given that parents, and possibly their teachers, don't know how to cope with these times.

This post came through from [Philip Russell](https://twitter.com/Mr_Russell_BGHS) on the [Cult of Pedagogy](https://www.cultofpedagogy.com/) blog that discussed some granular advice on bringing these topics into classrooms. I definitely like this focus, but it also sparks dialogue on the part of educators as to whether they feel this is appropriate.

### [The future of human work is imagination, creativity, & strategy](https://hbr.org/2018/01/the-future-of-human-work-is-imagination-creativity-and-strategy)

Great post in the Harvard Business Review on the future of jobs.

As we see technologies advance, we're also seeing multiple jobs, and entire fields may be eliminated due to these advances. This post shares some interesting perspectives to keep in the back of your mind:

- The Wizard of Oz Is the Wrong Model. The point of technology is to boost productivity, not cut the workforce.
- Humans Are Strategic; Machines Are Tactical. Work that requires a high degree of imagination, creative analysis, and strategic thinking is harder to automate.
- Integrating New Technology Is About Emotions. The wise corporate leader will understand how to integrate the new technology into the work flow, and how to cope with feelings that the new technology is somehow "the enemy."
- Rethink What Your Workforce Can Do. We can choose to use AI and other emerging technologies to replace human work, or we can choose to use them to augment it.

## 🔨 Do

### [Truly crispy, oven baked buffalo wings](http://www.recipetineats.com/truly-crispy-oven-baked-buffalo-wings-my-wings-cookbook/)

This past weekend, I wanted to make some buffalo wings for a party I was holding to watch the football playoffs. In the past, I've cooked wings in a crockpot, baked them in an over, and on the grill. They seem to never turn out quite right.

I first learned how to cook buffalo wings while working in a sports bar while at UMass. The process was to deep fry the wings, and then toss them in a hot saute pan with hot sauce and clarified butter. Sadly, I do not have a deep fryer in my house...yet. :)

This recipe turned out relatively well. The wings came out very crispy and tasted great. I then tossed them in a mixture of hot sauce, bbq sauce, butter, & brown sugar.

I'll definitely try this again. I've also been thinking about the science involved in baking contents with a light dusting of baking powder.
