This week I posted the following:

* Better visions of ourselves: Human futures, user data, & The Selfish Ledger (https://wiobyrne.com/better-visions-of-ourselves/) - This post is a bit of a long read, but it is my reflection/response to the Selfish Ledger video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDVVo14A_fo) that came out this week from Google. Take the 10 minutes to watch the video.
