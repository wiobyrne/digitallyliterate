## 📚 Readings & Insights

### 1. **AI Principles in Higher Education**
Educators are encouraged to adapt [six AI principles](https://www.elon.edu/u/ai-higher-education/) that emphasize:
- Prioritizing people over technology.
- Promoting digital inclusion.
- Integrating AI tools to enhance learning responsibly.

**Why this matters:** AI research and education must center on ethical practices and lifelong learning. [Learn more](https://www.elon.edu/u/imagining/event-coverage/global-igf/igf-2023/higher_ed_ai_statement/#signatories).

### 2. **Learning How to Innovate**
Generative AI tools excel at mimicking existing patterns but struggle to create genuinely novel designs. A collaboration between MIT-IBM and DeCoDe Lab highlights the challenges in developing innovative AI systems. [Read more](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010448523001410).

**Why this matters:** These tools need intentional strategies to push beyond replication into meaningful creativity.

---

### 3. **Computers as Better Teachers?**
Microsoft researchers propose training small language models using children’s stories. These models learn rapidly, demonstrating consistent and grammatical storytelling. [Explore the study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07759).

**Why this matters:** Smaller data sets may lead to more efficient and targeted AI training for specific tasks, challenging the “more data is better” approach.

---

### 4. **Dirty Words Are Magic Spells**
Swearing carries cultural weight, reflecting taboos and values. Its impact varies with context, shifting between offensive and affectionate. [Read the analysis](https://www.nytimes.com/2023-11-01/opinion/swearing-language-power.html).

**Why this matters:** Language’s power extends beyond meaning to influence context, emotion, and social dynamics.

---

### 5. **Lessons on Note-taking**
Robert Caro, author of _The Power Broker_, exemplifies meticulous note-taking. His archives showcase a commitment to truth, structured outlining, and daily writing goals. [Learn from Caro’s process](https://every.to/p/note-taking-lessons-from-america-s-greatest-biographer).

**Why this matters:** Thoughtful documentation transforms how we synthesize, retain, and communicate knowledge.

## 🛠️ DO: Five Habits of the Master Thinker

Former CIA analyst Randy Pherson devised the **Five Habits of the Master Thinker** to support effective decision-making:
1. **Challenge assumptions** through collaboration.
2. **Consider alternatives** to address biases.
3. **Identify contradictions** to streamline focus.
4. **Track key drivers** to reason efficiently.
5. **Assess the overall context** before forming judgments.

[Learn more](https://digitalcommons.usf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1282&context=jss) about applying these habits.
