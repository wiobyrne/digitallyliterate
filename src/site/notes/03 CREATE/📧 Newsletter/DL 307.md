## I'm Doing Research

Welcome back. Here's _Digitally Literate_, issue #307. 

This week I post the following:

- _[A Brief History of Earth by Andrew Knoll](https://wiobyrne.com/a-brief-history-of-earth-by-andrew-knoll/)_ - My main blog will become a space where I document my thinking over time. As part of that plan, I'll start saving book notes as I read. This first book in the series was great.
- _[I‚Äôm Teaching Myself TikTok](https://wiobyrne.com/im-teaching-myself-tiktok/)_ - Yeah...I never thought I'd head myself utter those words. As part of documenting my thinking over time, I'll share the [networked learning projects](https://wiobyrne.com/networked-learning-project/) I complete each semester with my students.
- _[What You‚Äôll Need For Mobile Vlogging](https://wiobyrne.com/what-youll-need-for-mobile-vlogging/)_ - Interesting in a mobile kit for video blogging? Perhaps you're teaching yourself how to make TikTok-style videos? Check out more here.

I also serve on the advisory board for BARWE. We're in the second month of the latest inquiry series. This month we discuss [how we can take action when doing anti-racist work in spite of real or perceived risks](https://www.barwe215.org/october-how-can-we-take-action-when-doing-anti-racist-work-in-spite-of-real-or-perceived-risks.html). If this is your first year doing this series, we recommend starting with an orientation meeting using the [September 2021 material](https://www.barwe215.org/september-how-do-we-prepare-ourselves-for-a-year-of-striving-towards-being-antiracist-educators.html) before moving on to the current month.¬†

## üìö This Week‚Äôs Highlights

### 1. **[Hall and Nails - "I Can't Get Closer for That"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxRpZGQnXcI)**  
A laugh-out-loud mashup by [Bill McClintock](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6C3PX8hLzueaPWW9nmT85w) blending Hall and Oates with Nine Inch Nails and Iron Maiden.  
**Why this matters:** A fun reminder of the creative potential in remix culture.

### 2. **[How Facebook Hobbled Mark Zuckerberg‚Äôs Bid to Get America Vaccinated](https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-mark-zuckerberg-vaccinated-11631880296?mod=article_inline)**  
We're continuing to unpack [the Facebook Files, A Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-facebook-files-11631713039?mod=bigtop-breadcrumb) investigation. Company documents show Facebook knew it was ‚Äúcesspools of anti-vaccine comments‚Äù and that they knew they needed to do something about it. Despite their problems with handling anti-vaxxer content, as the coronavirus vaccinations became available, Facebook made minimal or ineffectual efforts to address the issues and plays them down in public. Facebook has similarly struggled with how to handle the spread of inaccuracies on other issues, from QAnon conspiracy theories and other election falsehoods to hoax cancer cures and Holocaust denial.

**Why is this important:** One of the interesting pieces to take away from this reporting is the work that is happening as you use Facebook. You or a loved one may use Facebook to share photos, check in on others, and generally mean no ill will. You use the social network as your main media feed and trust what you're reading as it is "shared by your friends." In addition, as Facebook makes changes to any rules or structures in the community...you don't really pay attention.

In truth, when Facebook makes changes, some individuals and groups are keenly aware of these changes and use the tools to their advantage to spread misinformation, continue astroturfing, seed doubt, and stir violence. This is [disinformation by design](https://wiobyrne.com/trading-up-the-chain/).

What this looks like to you is an innocuous post that a friend shares with you with questions about vaccinations. You click on it and the algorithm pays attention. It shows you a couple more posts of the same type and you click on a couple...the algorithm feeds you some more. You then "conduct some research" and search online. You find a couple of groups that were set up ahead of time to handle your research interests. Suddenly, you're caught in one of those cesspools.

**Why this matters:** Disinformation spreads easily on platforms optimized for engagement, often to dangerous effect.

### 3. **[TikTok's Algorithm Leads Users from Transphobic Videos to Far-Right Rabbit Holes](https://www.mediamatters.org/tiktok/tiktoks-algorithm-leads-users-transphobic-videos-far-right-rabbit-holes)**  
Before you start thinking that Facebook is the only place with cesspools of content....TikTok says "hold my drink."

[Olivia Little](https://twitter.com/olivialittle) and [Abbie Richards](https://twitter.com/abbieasr) with some research on how TikTok‚Äôs algorithm took an account from transphobic videos to extremist videos in an alarmingly short amount of time.

The researchers created an account on TikTok and only engaged with content identified as transphobic. Transphobia is [deeply](https://www.thenation.com/article/society/transphobia-white-supremacy/) [intertwined](https://transsafety.network/posts/gcs-and-the-right/) with [other kinds](https://icsr.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ICSR-Report-Far-From-Gone-The-Evolution-of-Extremism-in-the-First-100-Days-of-the-Biden-Administration.pdf) of far-right extremism, and TikTok‚Äôs algorithm only reinforces this connection. TikTok's algorithm quickly picked up these signals and suggested content increasingly populated with videos promoting various far-right views and talking points.
**Why this matters:** Understanding algorithmic bias and its role in shaping user behavior is critical for digital literacy.

### 4. **[Borrowed a School Laptop? Mind Your Open Tabs](https://www.wired.com/story/borrowed-school-laptop-mind-open-tabs/)**  
When tens of millions of students suddenly had to learn remotely, many schools lent laptops and tablets to those without them. These devices typically come with monitoring software. This is generally viewed as a way to protect students and keep them on-task.

In one district, parents and teachers recognized that the monitoring software started closing some tabs. They soon learned that all of the district‚Äôs school-issued devices use [Securly](https://www.securly.com/), student-monitoring software that lets teachers see a student‚Äôs screen in real-time and even close tabs if they discover a student is off-task. During class time, students were expected to have only two tabs open.

Now, some privacy advocates, parents, and teachers say that software created a new digital divide, limiting what some students could do and putting them at increased risk of disciplinary action.

_There are certain groups of students, more likely those attending lower-income schools, who are going to be more reliant on school-issued devices and therefore be subject to more surveillance and tracking.‚Äù - [Elizabeth Laird](https://twitter.com/elizabethan), [Center for Democracy and Technology](https://cdt.org/)._
**Why this matters:** Surveillance disproportionately impacts low-income students who rely on school-provided devices.

### 5. **[Here‚Äôs What I Tell Teachers About Teaching Slavery](https://theconversation.com/heres-what-i-tell-teachers-about-how-to-teach-young-students-about-slavery-161492)**  
Teaching slavery has been and will continue to be challenging. [Raphael Rogers](https://www2.clarku.edu/faculty/facultybio.cfm?id=931) shares four things that can serve as strong guideposts for creating lessons that should make the challenge easier to navigate.
1. Explore actual records.  
2. Examine historical arguments.  
3. Highlight lived experiences.  
4. Consider the relevance.  
**Why this matters:** Thoughtful education on challenging topics fosters understanding and empathy.

### 6. **[13 People Share the Habits They‚Äôre Bringing Back to the Office](https://www.wired.com/story/serene-city-building-games-islanders-townscaper-cloud-gardens/)**  
As I'm beginning the transition back to face-to-face work after working from home for some time, I've been thinking about what I've learned...and what I'll keep in my workflow. This post shares some actionable guidance.

1. Plan out your week every Sunday
2. Keep my essentials in a carryall zip pouch
3. Use time blocking
4. Eliminate meetings on Mondays and Fridays
5. Write down the next day‚Äôs to-do list
6. Wake up at the same time every morning
7. Set intentions every morning
8. Add personal appointments to your work calendar
9. Go paperless
10. Set an alarm to take a walk
11. Eat smaller, more frequent meals
12. Use the 45-second rule
13. Get outside at least once a day
**Why this matters:** Intentional habits help maintain productivity and well-being in changing circumstances.

## üõ†Ô∏è DO: How to Read a Book  

Thinking about reading more?

Mortimer Adler and Charles Van Doren literally wrote [the book on reading](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0671212095/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=farnamstreet-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0671212095&linkId=95f640336f1079ee3b5acafcc3a34a84). They identify four levels of reading:

1. **Elementary Reading**: Basic comprehension.  
2. **Inspectional Reading**: Skim for structure and key ideas.  
3. **Analytical Reading**: Dive deep and digest the text.  
4. **Syntopical Reading**: Compare ideas across multiple texts for a broader understanding.
