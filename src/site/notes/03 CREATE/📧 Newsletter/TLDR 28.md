** Too Long; Didn't Read (TL;DR) newsletter #28

------------------------------------------------------------

Hi all, welcome to the TL;DR Newsletter. In this I'm sharing things that happened during the week in literacy, technology, & education that I think you should know. Please feel free to share with others you believe would benefit. If you like what you see here, I recommend subscribing (http://wiobyrne.us11.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=7b5ee323a16720dad25ff96ff&id=17e92a2ae1) to get it hand-delivered to your inbox.

This week I shared the following:

* Four questions for Tom Liam Lynch about coding, programming, and computational thinking/participation (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CG_3xjCYoNs) - This interview is part of a series of interviews conducted with experts in the field to act as a supplement to the JAAL Department columns. This interview is a supplement to the recent column on computational thinking/participation (http://wiobyrne.com/computational-participation-coding-and-programming-as-literacy-activities/) .

*  Iterating on an open educational learning experience for educators & students in the #WalkMyWorld Project (http://wiobyrne.com/iterating-on-an-open-educational-learning-experience-for-educators-students-in-the-walkmyworld-project/) - This post is a reflection and feedback to a post from Greg McVerry about possible next steps in planning/facilitation of the project.

* Using blogs (and Medium) to create a fishbowl discussion for project planning (http://wiobyrne.com/using-blogs-and-medium-fishbowl-discussion/) - This post discusses opportunities to use blogs and other digital texts to plan and facilitate discussions in the public...while allowing others to comment.

** Adding "beauty and joy" to Obama's push for computer science teaching (http://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2016/01/14/462954645/adding-beauty-and-joy-to-obamas-push-for-computer-science-teaching?utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=education)

This past week in the State of the Union, Obama spent some time to talk about his legacy, and point toward the future. In this he indicated that he'll spend time in his remaining year ** developing programs to help students learn how to code (http://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2016/01/12/462698966/the-president-wants-every-student-to-learn-computer-science-how-would-that-work?utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=education)

.

The link above pushes back against this initiative by including guidance from Dan Garcia, a computer science professor at the University of California, Berkeley. Dan publishes videos from a makeshift studio at his home for a MOOC he has developed called the "** Beauty and Joy of Computing (http://bjc.berkeley.edu/)

."

** The four Cs of learning (http://www.thethinkingstick.com/the-4-cs-of-learning/)

This post by Jeff Utecht details the "four Cs that are going to change education in the 21st Century." There is not much new in the elements that he indicates (communication, collaboration, creativity, critical thinking) but I believe it's important to continue to highlight some of these dispositions or mindsets our students will need in the future.

** A Minimum Viable Product is an object for learning (http://timkastelle.org/blog/2016/01/a-minimum-viable-product-is-an-object-for-learning/)

Over the past couple of weeks I've been developing new goals for projects/initiatives in the upcoming year.

Much of this work, when it involves technology or digital content, is hard to discuss or imagine without seeing a prototype. To that end, the minimum viable product (MVP) is often viewed as that prototype.

This post indicates that the MVP isn't really a prototype, it's a learning object. The post is #5 in a series of posts. The posts are primarily developed for business and innovators. I think they have merit for those of us thinking about innovating in our classrooms or personal life using digital texts and tools.

** ow cooking is like coding (http://brettterpstra.com/2015/12/29/kitchen-coding/?utm_medium=feed)

This post from ** Brett Terpstra (http://brettterpstra.com/)

provides a good perspective into coding and possible connections to cooking.

The ideas presented are not necessarily new, but they do provide insight into the frameworks and steps involved in the process.

** oes size matter - for brains? (http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/does-size-matter-mdash-for-brains/)

Interesting piece in Scientific American looking at brain size and cognitive ability in organisms from humans to honeybees to whales.

Although we cannot entirely look at size or number of neurons, perhaps we can start to consider the streamlining of our synapses and neurons as we each evolve.

## 🔨 Do

** What I like about Hypothes.is (http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/what-i-like-about-hypothes-is/61505)

** Hypothes.is (https://hypothes.is/)

is an open annotation tool for the Internet. In the past I've used tools like ** Genius (http://genius.com/)

to markup and annotate texts.

I've moved over to Hypothes.is and prefer the lightweight ways that it plugs in to my browser and connects my comments and links saved across the Internet. It's basically providing us with a way to add a social, annotated layer to the web. Definitely check it out.

## 🤔 Consider

If you set your goals ridiculously high and it's a failure, you will fail above everyone else's success.
