** Too Long; Didn't Read (TL;DR) newsletter #145

------------------------------------------------------------

TL;DR is a summary of all the great stuff I read so you don't have to...but I encourage it. Welcome to Issue #145. This week we grin and bear it.

Here's what I posted this week:

* What is "empowerment" in education? (http://wiobyrne.com/empowerment/) - This post shares a bit of the research and theory about empowerment...and why you should care.

* Moving beyond survival (http://wiobyrne.com/moving-beyond-survival/) - A short post about awareness, building self-confidence, and problematizing your perspectives.

## 📺 Watch

** Albert Wenger on the Decentralized Future (10:46) (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3EBcmQZCZw&)

This video was a bit of an unexpected inspiration in my week. I recommend watching it and considering what this means for our futures.

in addition to the video, I'm considering starting up a "summer reading/discussion group" in the upcoming weeks. We'll collaboratively read Wenger's book, ** World After Capital (http://worldaftercapital.org/)

. Let me know if you're interested in joining us in these discussions.

## 📚 Read

** Mozilla's 2018 Internet Health Report (https://internethealthreport.org/2018/)

This week Mozilla released the 2018 version of their Internet Health Report. The Internet Health Report is about the human experience of the Internet. It is an independent, open source compilation of data, research and stories that show how the Internet is evolving across five issues.

This report features global insights and perspectives across five issues: ** Privacy and security (https://internethealthreport.org/2018/category/privacy-and-security/)

, ** Openness (https://internethealthreport.org/2018/category/openness/)

, ** Digital inclusion (https://internethealthreport.org/2018/category/digital-inclusion/)

, ** Web literacy (https://internethealthreport.org/2018/category/web-literacy/)

and ** Decentralization (https://internethealthreport.org/2018/category/decentralization/)

.

The key takeaway: More people are opening their eyes to the real impact the Internet has on our societies, economies, and personal wellbeing. We are beginning to see the health of the Internet as not just a technical issue, but a human one.

** 12 things everyone should understand about tech (https://anildash.com/2018/04/07/12-things-everyone-should-understand-about-tech/)

Great overview by ** Anil Dash (https://twitter.com/anildash)

about the role of tech in our lives, culture, politics and society. Dash notes, "Given all the time we spend with our gadgets and apps, it’s essential to understand the principles that determine how tech affects our lives."

Anil's 12 points:

* Tech is not neutral.

* Tech is not inevitable.

* Most people in tech sincerely want to do good.

* Tech history is poorly documented and poorly understood.

* Most tech education doesn’t include ethical training.

* Tech is often built with surprising ignorance about its users.

* There is never just one single genius creator of technology.

* Most tech isn’t from startups or by startups.

* Most big tech companies make money in just one of three ways.

* The economic model of big companies skews all of tech.

* Tech is as much about fashion as function.

* No institution has the power to rein in tech’s abuses.

** Teens also sometimes quit social media (https://www.buzzfeed.com/katienotopoulos/teens-also-sometimes-quit-social-media?utm_term=.gqr9XG7Eoo#.ljdAPWebNN)

Adults talk a big game about #deletefacebook or taking a break from Twitter, but true digital natives actually know how to take a break for their own mental health.

We think of teens as being connected to social media like an umbilical cord, incapable of breathing without it. For teens, the stresses caused by Instagram or Snapchat are very different than an adult’s disenchantment with the news on Twitter, and ** the stakes are often way higher (https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/05/19/instagram-ranked-worst-social-network-young-peoples-mental-health/)

.

Perhaps only these true parseltongues, who were entering kindergarten while Myspace was peaking, have the self-awareness and ability to know when to unplug.

** Psychological weapons of mass persuasion (https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/psychological-weapons-of-mass-persuasion/)

We need to spend more time unpacking the "science" behind psychographic profiles and the impact of this data collection on our identities and practices. Basically this is an indication of the collection of your socio-demographic data online, and using/selling your data for micro-targeting purposes.

I'm still digging in to make sense of how I feel about this. But, the question remains...can your digital footprints be leveraged for mass or individual persuasion?

** Instructional designers are teachers (http://hybridpedagogy.org/instructional-designers-are-teachers/)

This post by ** Sean Michael Morris (https://twitter.com/slamteacher)

was exactly what I needed this past week. The post details the challenges and multiple hats that instructional designers wear on a daily, or hourly basis.

Don't get me wrong...I'm not an instructional designer by trade. I was once asked if I was an instructional designer and I needed to look it up online. But, if you're wondering whether or not this column is for you, here's the section that did it for me.

Instructional designers, then, understand digital space. They understand learning. They understand teaching. And they understand technology.

## 🔨 Do

Please be advised that this super-cool data visualization project has the potential to keep you busy for some time.

James Yoder, an incoming freshman at the University of Texas Austin, just published a site detailing every satellite, busted rocket, and piece of space junk currently orbiting Earth. The website above reveals an astounding map of the roughly 20,000 pieces of debris floating in space, as well as information pertaining to its launch year, velocity, altitude, and inclination.

Clicking on any of the thousands of available dots reveals such information, and also displays the object’s orbiting flight path.

## 🤔 Consider

Sometimes your joy is the source of your smile, but sometimes your smile can be the source of your joy.
