# TLDR 146

**Published**: 2018-04-21 • [[03 CREATE/📧 Newsletter/📧 Newsletter\|📧 Newsletter]]

Welcome to Issue 146. This week we mind the gap.

Here's what I posted this week:

- [Digital Storytelling in Early Childhood: Student illustrations shaping social interactions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1frwQoTcVzW5F1uA6bZ81Erd7nqPi4l7MJfFDtcMcsL8/edit?usp=sharing) - This week we finalized a research manuscript and sent it out only to get caught up in the challenges of publishing openly online. More to come on that later.

### [How to use rap in your classroom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJEtbfiLATY)

This semester I rebooted the slam poetry, spoken word, and hip-hop club that I ran when I taught middle school. The current iteration is a class of freshman that is exploring, writing, and presenting. Our final presentations are next week, and I'm excited to see my students perform in class.

This video from the [Flocabulary YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOsCwMammtm9TXnE0BMbKzw) is an excellent way to bring us to the end of the semester, and help us write rhymes.

### [The future of well-being in a tech-saturated world](http://www.pewinternet.org/2018/04/17/the-future-of-well-being-in-a-tech-saturated-world/)

In light of mounting concerns, the [Pew Research Center](http://www.pewresearch.org/) and [Elon University's Imagining the Internet Center](http://www.elon.edu/e-web/imagining/default.xhtml) queried technology experts, scholars and health specialists on this question: Over the next decade, how will changes in digital life impact people's overall well-being physically and mentally?

This new canvassing of technology experts finds that a third of them (32%) believe digital life will produce more harm than help when it comes to people's well-being in the coming decade. However, nearly half of those in this canvassing (47%) say it will produce more help than harm. The vast majority (92%) of both the hopeful and the worried recommend that government policies, technology company practices and user norms need to change to mitigate the harms and accentuate the benefits of digital tech.

### [The Wired guide to Internet addiction](https://www.wired.com/story/wired-guide-to-internet-addiction/)

"You don't need to see the stats to know it's hard to put down your device—the muscle memory of pull-to-refresh, the devil of the red notification on your shoulder, the rush that follows a flood of likes, the Instagram envy, the FOMO, scrolling endlessly by screenlight instead of falling asleep."

This "guide" from Wired discusses the screentime debate, and whether or not we're addicted to these technologies. This is helpful as we decide whether this is a cause for concern, or techno-panic.

### [Advising on screen time in Australia: Is the evidence up to the task?](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/parenting4digitalfuture/2018/04/18/advising-on-screen-time-in-australia/)

Screens have been part of children's lives for well over half a century, and we have been [asking questions about](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/133/3458/1066.1) their effects for just as long. The types of problems mentioned in guidelines in [Australia](https://www.academia.edu/9148007/0_8_very_young_children_and_the_domestication_of_touchscreen_technologies_in_Australia) and elsewhere, are not new, with many often mentioned in 'limitations' sections of published research.

Surely it is time to move on from acknowledging, then ignoring, the significant limitations that studies have in their ability to answer questions about the complex relationships between children and screen-based media. There is a need to Include knowledge from a broader range of fields that would help fill the gaps currently left by the medical and epidemiological literature.

At stake is a clearer pathway to robust evidence bases likely to produce more meaningful and, ultimately, better quality guidance for parents and others involved in raising children with a digital future in mind.

### [The future of college looks like the future of retail](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2018/04/college-online-degree-blended-learning/557642/)

Similar to e-commerce firms, online-degree programs are beginning to incorporate elements of an older-school, brick-and-mortar model. As online learning extends its reach it is starting to run into a major obstacle: There are undeniable advantages, as traditional colleges have long known, to learning in a shared physical space.

Recognizing this, some online programs are gradually incorporating elements of the old-school, brick-and-mortar model—just as online retailers such as Bonobos and Warby Parker use relatively small physical outlets to spark sales on their websites and increase customer loyalty. Perhaps the future of higher education sits somewhere between the physical and the digital.

Looking for opportunities to dissolve the physical-digital dichotomy.

## 🤔 Consider

> "Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance, you must keep moving." — Albert Einstein

This week we mind the gap. The physicist's simple metaphor captures a profound truth about momentum and equilibrium—standing still on a bicycle guarantees a fall, just as stagnation in life leads to imbalance. The constant forward motion required for balance mirrors our need for continuous learning and adaptation in education and technology. When we stop moving, stop learning, stop questioning, we lose our ability to navigate the complexities around us.
