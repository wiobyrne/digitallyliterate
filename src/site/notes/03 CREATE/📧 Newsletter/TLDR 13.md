Thank you once again for signing up for this newsletter. Thanks again for the support.

I also want to thank the incomparable Bryan Mathers (https://twitter.com/BryanMMathers?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) for the incredible cover art for the TL;DR Newsletter. He is a true genius...and a good friend.

This week I posted:

* Introducing Web Literacy: Reading, Writing, and Participating (http://wiobyrne.com/introducing-web-literacy-reading-writing-participating/) - I'm presenting twice at the K12 Online Conference coming up in October. One of these sessions is with Greg McVerry and focuses on the Mozilla Web Lit initiative we've been working on. This post shares a video remix teaser (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dwuay7PFxEc&feature=youtu.be) for our session available below. We were trying to spoof this commercial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFJ1a1D4hdo) from Microsoft.

## 📺 Watch

** A space balloon story - Grand Canyon from the stratosphere (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EABQ5psUz70)

I love opportunities for ** backyard science (https://www.pinterest.com/greenkidcrafts/backyard-science-activities/)

. This is even more fun as technological devices are getting even more inexpensive by the day. ** A great example (http://wiobyrne.com/backyard-science-the-rocket-report/)

of this is from my good friend us Lessing.

In the video above, some students wanted to launch a weather balloon attached to a GoPro to see what they would get. Two years later...they got their answer. The ** full story is here (https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/3khrwc/i_sent_gopro_attached_to_a_weather_balloon_above/)

## 📚 Read

** 9th-Grade Maker Arrested Because His Clock Project Looked Like a Fake Bomb (http://makezine.com/2015/09/16/ignorance-fear-put-9th-grade-maker-handcuffs/)

The terrible story of Ahmed Mohamed, a 9th grader in Irving, Texas, was led from his school in handcuffs earlier this week after bringing his DIY clock circuit to school.

Read more at the ** Dallas Morning News (http://www.dallasnews.com/news/community-news/northwest-dallas-county/headlines/20150915-irving-ninth-grader-arrested-after-taking-homemade-clock-to-school.ece)

.

There appears to be a slightly more positive ending to this story as Ahmed is supported ** online (http://www.dallasnews.com/news/community-news/northwest-dallas-county/headlines/20150915-irving-ninth-grader-arrested-after-taking-homemade-clock-to-school.ece)

and ** off (http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/17/us/texas-student-is-under-police-investigation-for-building-a-clock.html)

. He also is ** leaving his school (http://techcrunch.com/2015/09/18/the-texas-maker-who-was-arrested-for-building-a-clock-is-switching-schools/?ncid=rss)

.

I just hope that this promotes dialogue about the maker culture...and some of the underlying cultural events that spurred this. I also feel a kinship with Ahmed...even though** I'm not totally like him (http://ihnatko.com/2015/09/16/im-achmed-except-im-not-brown/)

** he web we need to give to students (https://medium.com/bright/the-web-we-need-to-give-students-311d97713713)

A great piece from Audrey Watters and the need to provide all of our learners with a "domain of one's own."

“Giving students their own digital domain is a radical act. It gives them the ability to work on the Web and with the Web.”

** Poverty, grit, and teachers (http://www.mrwilliamsstem.com/posts/250365-poverty-grit-and-teachers)

Interesting opinion piece from ** Taylor Williams (https://twitter.com/MrWilliamsSTEM)

as he considers the narrative we often share about the need for "grit" in our students. The belief that if you work hard enough, you can escape poverty. This is acceptable until you consider the contrapositive...if you didn't escape poverty, you didn't work hard enough.

** sychology lessons from Key and Peele (http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/psysociety/psychology-lessons-from-key-peele/)

A great overview from Scientific American discussing the wit and insight presented from Key and Peele as they leave their show.

I was introduced to the show by Shane Smith, a former colleague while at UNH. Since watching the ** Substitute Teacher (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dd7FixvoKBw)

skit...I've used their pieces in many of my classes.

** The ten most important books to expand your brain (https://medium.com/life-learning/the-ten-most-important-books-to-expand-your-brain-a387cc0c5db6)

Searching to expand (or validate) your reading list? Check out this list by ** James Altucher (https://twitter.com/jaltucher)

...and the comments...for some great ideas.

** How to be a better listener (http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-to-be-a-better-listener/)

As the school year starts, we focus on listening, speaking, and argumentation skills with our students. This piece from Scientific American discusses some strategies for clearing our heads...and focusing on the ideas and thoughts of others.

## 🔨 Do

** reate magazine covers using (http://www.freetech4teachers.com/2015/09/design-magazine-covers-with-canvas-new.html)

** Canva (http://www.freetech4teachers.com/2015/09/design-magazine-covers-with-canvas-new.html)

I really love ** Canva (https://www.canva.com/)

. Canva describes itself as "amazingly simple graphic design software" and they deliver. Looking to design graphic elements for your digital content and social media pages? Check out Canva.

The tool is free for most uses. You can pay for certain elements, but I can get a lot done with their free tools.

There are tons of potential uses for the classroom. I really like Richard Byrne's idea of creating and critiquing magazine covers using the tool. I'd also recommend checking out this overview on ** using (http://www.freetech4teachers.com/2015/09/4-ways-visual-literacy-is-being-taught.html)
