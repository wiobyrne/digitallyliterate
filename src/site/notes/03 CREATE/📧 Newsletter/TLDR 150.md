TL;DR #150 - 5/18/2018

------------------------------------------------------------

You’ll notice some changes this week as we’re sliming down for the summer. Let me know what you think. :)

This week I posted the following:

* What is “Critical Pedagogy”? (https://wiobyrne.com/what-is-critical-pedagogy/) - This is a follow-up to last week’s post (https://wiobyrne.com/critical-literacy/) about critical literacy as I connect the dots to teaching and learning.

* Breadcrumbs (https://breadcrumbs.wiobyrne.com/) - As a reminder, I’ve started to play more with switching up my signals (https://wiobyrne.com/switching-up-my-signals/) and Indie Web philosophies. This website (https://breadcrumbs.wiobyrne.com/) is where I’m archiving as I read, learn, & connect online.
