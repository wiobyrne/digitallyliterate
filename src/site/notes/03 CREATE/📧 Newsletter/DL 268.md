Welcome back to Digitally Literate. Dear Frog, This Water Is Now Boiling

This week I worked on the following:

- *[Are you busy or productive?](https://wiobyrne.com/are-you-busy-or-productive/)* - Busy work, or busy time is unproductive.
- *[Begin Owning Your Online Content](https://wiobyrne.com/begin-owning-your-online-content/)* - If you want to begin owning your content online, you need to start thinking differently about content, audience, and identity.
- *[Becoming Self-Actualized](https://wiobyrne.com/becoming-self-actualized/)* - Do you know what you *want* to be when you grow up? Are you making that your reality?
- *[Speak To An Audience](https://wiobyrne.com/speak-to-an-audience/)* - As we create, it's important to identify and speak to a specific audience.
- *[Hell Yeah…or No](https://wiobyrne.com/hell-yeah/)* - A simple philosophy that goes like this: when you are asked to do something, anything, with your time, it needs to be a 'hell yes' or a 'no'.

This latest video is an update to [this video from DSLR Video Shooter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WedG8LKO6ks).

These two videos have been helpful as I continue to think about how to build up a space for video connections.

### [Your Computer Isn't Yours](https://sneak.berlin/20201112/your-computer-isnt-yours/)

Apple announced an update to Mac OS this week. Mac OS X is dead…welcome to [macOS 11.0 Big Sur](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/11/macos-11-0-big-sur-the-ars-technica-review/).

Jeffrey Paul indicates that in the current version of the macOS, the OS sends to Apple a hash (unique identifier) of each and every program you run when you run it.

*This means that Apple knows when you're at home. When you're at work. What apps you open there, and how often. They know when you open Premiere over at a friend's house on their Wi-Fi, and they know when you open Tor Browser in a hotel on a trip to another city.*

The day that [Stallman](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/right-to-read.en.html) and [Doctorow](https://craphound.com/pc/download/) have been warning us about has finally arrived.

### [Misinformation by a thousand cuts: Varied rigged election claims circulate](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/misinformation-thousand-cuts-varied-rigged-election-claims-circulate-n1247476)

A dizzying array of false claims and conspiracy theories have dominated social and ultraconservative media since the early morning after Election Day.

We often discuss the intersections of mis/disinformation and social networking spaces. We've also the role that Facebook has played in swaying how the worldview of millions.

Facebook has talked a big game about monitoring election misinformation. But, when [Steve Bannon was outed this week](https://gizmodo.com/steve-bannon-caught-running-a-network-of-misinformation-1845633004) for his involvement in running a network of misinformation pages on Facebook, [Zuckerberg strangely indicated](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-facebook-idUSKBN27S35P) that this did not cross the line.

At this point we need to assume that Facebook's moderation policies are more or less arbitrary, or completely borked. In addition, we must assume at this point that Facebook, or at least Zuckerberg and shareholders value the attention, protection, and $$$$$ that is brought on by conservative and dark donors.

In the end, it may not even matter as [conservatives tend to see expert evidence & personal experience as more equally legitimate than scientific perspectives](https://theconversation.com/conservatives-value-personal-stories-more-than-liberals-do-when-evaluating-scientific-evidence-149132).

### [A Game Designer's Analysis Of QAnon](https://medium.com/curiouserinstitute/a-game-designers-analysis-of-qanon-580972548be5)

We've talked about QAnon many times in this newsletter. In a previous episode, I asked how QAnon is similar/different from other affinity groups like [Harry Potter fans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter_fandom) and [Trekkies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trekkie).

[Reed Berkowitz](https://twitter.com/soi), director of [the Curiouser Institute](http://www.curiouserinstitute.com/content/about-director) has experience developing games and indicates the commonalities between the two.

*QAnon has often been compared to ARGs and LARPs and rightly so. It uses many of the same gaming mechanisms and rewards. It has a game-like feel to it that is evident to anyone who has ever played an ARG, online role-play (RP) or LARP before. The similarities are so striking that it has often been referred to as a LARP or ARG. However, this beast is very very different from a game.*

Berkowitz labels this a guided apophenia. [Apophenia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apophenia) is : *"the tendency to perceive a connection or meaningful pattern between unrelated or random things (such as objects or ideas)"*

### ["Other countries have social safety nets. The U.S. has women."](https://annehelen.substack.com/p/other-countries-have-social-safety)

As part of the [Culture Study newsletter](https://annehelen.substack.com/), [Anne Helen Petersen](https://twitter.com/annehelen) interviews [Jess Calarco](http://www.jessicacalarco.com/) about her recent research on mothers grappling with parenting, partners, anxiety, work, and feelings of failure during the pandemic.

**Connected concepts**:
- [[QAnon Guided Apophenia\|QAnon Guided Apophenia]] - Reed Berkowitz's game designer analysis reveals how QAnon functions as "guided apophenia" - using gaming mechanisms to guide people toward perceiving meaningful patterns between unrelated things. Unlike ARGs or LARPs which are bounded games, QAnon applies these techniques to real-world conspiracy thinking, creating an endless loop where participants constantly "discover" connections that confirm their worldview. This connects to broader questions about how gamification can be weaponized for radicalization.
- [[Apple Privacy Surveillance\|Apple Privacy Surveillance]] - macOS Big Sur's tracking of every program you run represents the fulfillment of warnings from Stallman and Doctorow about proprietary software surveillance. Apple knowing when you're home, at work, or traveling based on app usage demonstrates how even "privacy-focused" tech companies normalize data collection. This erosion of computer ownership connects to larger themes about whether users truly control their devices or merely license them under corporate surveillance.
- [[Women as Social Safety Net\|Women as Social Safety Net]] - Jessica Calarco's research reveals how the U.S. relies on women to absorb social and economic shocks rather than building institutional support systems. The pandemic made visible what was always true: when work-family conflicts arise, mothers disproportionately sacrifice careers. This connects to themes about how gender inequality and inadequate social infrastructure intersect, with women expected to provide unpaid labor that other countries address through policy.
