** DeRay McKesson talks bullying and justice (1:24) (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zx1IhpzUILY&t=22s)

Mozilla recently invited ** DeRay McKesson (https://twitter.com/deray)

, American civil rights activist, to speak at ** A Night for Internet Health (https://blog.mozilla.org/internetcitizen/2017/07/28/441/)

. There, McKesson ** talked about bullying and its impact (https://blog.mozilla.org/internetcitizen/2017/07/31/a-more-inclusive-world-and-web/)

. In this video clip from the event, he indicated that the currencies of bullying are fear and confusion. And, importantly, that silence can’t be the answer.

## 📚 Read

This week a software engineer from Google released a ** 10 page screed (http://gizmodo.com/exclusive-heres-the-full-10-page-anti-diversity-screed-1797564320/amp)

against the diversity initiatives taking place within the company. The ** software engineer was fired for violating the code of conduct (https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-08-08/google-fires-employee-behind-controversial-diversity-memo)

at Google.

** Responses to this manifesto (https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/kzbm4a/employees-anti-diversity-manifesto-goes-internally-viral-at-google)

range from viewing this as an isolated incident to instead being a manifestation of what ails all of Silicon Valley.

One thing to recognize from this event, and the subsequent response is presented eloquently in the link above:

These reactions to the screed are sound, but they risk missing a larger problem: The kind of computing systems that get made and used by people outside the industry, and with serious consequences, are a direct byproduct of the gross machismo of computing writ large. More women and minorities are needed in computing because the world would be better for their contributions—and because it might be much worse without them.

** The fate of online trust in the next decade (http://www.pewinternet.org/2017/08/10/the-fate-of-online-trust-in-the-next-decade/)

I've shared quite a bit about trust and online relationships over the past couple of months here in TL;DR. Much of this discussion has been kicked into overdrive as I research and write about blockchain and derivative technologies.

This report from the Pew Internet Project shares findings from recent research that surveyed experts in these new and digital fields. The results try to paint a picture of the future of online trust in the coming decade. I think it's fun to read through the quotes and consider the implications for the field. I even have a quote in there.

Six themes emerge from the responses:

* Trust will strengthen because systems will improve and people will adapt to them and more broadly embrace them.

* The nature of trust will become more fluid as technology embeds itself into human and organizational relationships.

* Trust will not grow, but technology usage will continue to rise, as a “new normal” sets in.

* Some say blockchain could help; some expect its value might be limited.

* The less-than-satisfying current situation will not change much in the next decade.

* Trust will diminish because the internet is not secure, and powerful forces threaten individuals’ rights.

** Here's how we'll measure Internet health (https://internethealthreport.org/2017/08/09/here-is-how-well-measure-internet-health/)

Mozilla's ** Internet Health Report project (https://internethealthreport.org/v01/)

is still busy working behind the scenes as they try to identify opportunities to create a better web. As part of this project, they've been busy canvassing experts in the field to identify what elements need to be considered as we talk about Internet health. The five areas they've identified through this process include:

* Openness

* Digital inclusion

* Decentralization

* Privacy & security

* Web literacy

These areas will become the focus of their assessment of Internet health.

** The digital native is a myth (http://www.nature.com/news/the-digital-native-is-a-myth-1.22363)

This story is not new at all, but it interested me that it showed up in ** Nature (http://www.nature.com/nature)

of all places.

I detest the term ** digital native (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_native)

, and think that it has set back the field, especially education, as we believe that children (or those younger than us) are hard wired and more able to handle these digital, communicative technologies.

This piece shares ** a paper from Teaching and Teacher Education (http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0742051X16306692?via%3Dihub)

that posits that younger generations use technology in the same ways as older people...for better or worse. The post also suggests that youth are no better at multitasking than their older counterparts.

** A designer's guide to brainstorms that are actually useful (https://www.fastcodesign.com/90135970/a-designers-guide-to-brainstorms-that-are-actually-useful?partner=feedburner)

This post from ** FastCoDesign (https://www.fastcodesign.com/)

shares insight from ** design thinking perspectives (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_thinking)

and the ** Stanford D School (https://dschool.stanford.edu/)

to help you successfully brainstorm.

They provide two main rules for a successful brainstorm:

1. Defer judgement

2. Reach for quantity

They close with a granular series of directions for setting up a great brainstorming session. I definitely recommend testing some of these out in your work, or in your work with others.

## 🔨 Do

Last month I went home to the Philadelphia area to celebrate the 40th birthday of one of my brothers. One of my other brothers is a chef in Philly and he catered the event for us. While prepping for the party, I was perched next to him to watch what he was making as he never lets us down.

He knew that I'd be looking for the good stuff, so he pulled out this large plastic container with a golden syrup and peaches floating in the middle. He went on to explain that it was peach mostarda and then spent a half hour explaining the process used to make the syrup in their kitchens. The simple syrup gets a spicy kick from some powerful mustard oil that is apparently banned in the U.S.

The syrup is thick and definitely spicy at the end. The flavor is reminiscent of fine meats and cheeses. I know it sounds weird, but the flavor was intoxicating and we drizzled it on everything from fine cheeses to grilled chicken.

I'm in the process now of figuring out how to make my own batches next time I cook up a batch of jellies.
