** Too Long; Didn't Read (TL;DR) newsletter #26

------------------------------------------------------------

In TL;DR I'm sharing things that happened during the week in literacy, technology, & education that I think you should know. Please feel free to share with others you believe would benefit. If you like what you see here, I recommend subscribing (http://wiobyrne.us11.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=7b5ee323a16720dad25ff96ff&id=17e92a2ae1) to get it hand-delivered to your inbox.

I also turned off tracking for this newsletter. Mailchimp has a ton of tracking features built in to the system. I decided to respect your privacy while believing in the inherent value of this work.

We also launched the AdvocatED publication (https://medium.com/advocat-ed) on Medium. If you would like to write/blog for this publication...please contact me. As part of this publication, I just published this post on open publishing and scholarship (https://medium.com/advocat-ed/the-challenge-of-open-online-scholarship-in-academia-37d12b30fc43#.cstrfwtnv) . Feel free to read...and give me some feedback on the Medium pub.

Also, take time to nominate yourself or a colleague as a tech innovator in higher ed (http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/call-for-nominations-who-are-the-top-tech-innovators-in-higher-education-2/57690?cid=wc&utm_source=wc&utm_medium=en&elq=ed16ee3862d14ab6a237c6b5ff916e25&elqCampaignId=2027&elqaid=7166&elqat=1&elqTrackId=f7fad5d2f8194d6c8622dbcfb774f36a) .

As many of you sit and plan your upcoming year and make resolutions...let's figure out how we can all be more creative and make.

** "The Internet is the most basic form of the punk rock revolution" (http://bavatuesdays.com/the-internet-is-the-most-basic-form-of-the-punk-rock-revolution/)

A post by ** Jim Groom (https://twitter.com/jimgroom)

that gives a recommendation of a series of interviews conducted by ** Ian Svenonius (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian%20Svenonius)

with Calvin Johnson, a force in the punk rock movement.

The ** interview (https://youtu.be/V3ENpMnvdaQ)

shares a glimpse at the possible intersection between "appropriate technology", creativity, and the DIY ethos.

Groom synthesizes from the interview:

Towards the very end of the interview (26:10) Svenonious wonders, given how arduous the production process is for capturing music,”Why don’t people just sing to one another?” A off-handed remark that Johnson turns into a brilliant moment in which he posits: “That’s what the internet is.” By sidestepping the whole production process they’re singing directly to one another while making it available instantly all around the world. A technological development that he sees as “the most basic form of the punk rock revolution.”

** Four things that highly creative people do (http://www.spencerideas.org/2015/12/four-things-that-highly-creative-people.html)

A post from ** John Spencer (http://www.twitter.com/spencerideas)

in which he synthesizes research for an upcoming book on creativity.

Here's what they have in common:

1. They make mistakes. Loads of them. Their work sucks at the beginning, just like yours and just like mine.

2. They poop. I like to remember that everybody poops because it's sort-of a disarming fact. The greatest creative geniuses are still absolutely normal. They eat and drink. They stub their toes and yell out expletives. They fall in love.

3. They get scared that no one will like their stuff. But still . . .

4. They make stuff.

** Dyslexia and the wider world of creativity (http://ww2.kqed.org/mindshift/2015/12/15/dyslexia-and-the-wider-world-of-creativity-and-talent/)

A blog post from ** H (http://www.drjuliashaw.com/)

** olly Korbey (https://twitter.com/hkorbey)

on the ** Mind/Shift (http://ww2.kqed.org/mindshift/)

**  blog (http://ww2.kqed.org/mindshift/)

that discusses the challenges and opportunities that exist in literacy, creativity, and patterns in dyslexia. This post also gives me a chance to share artwork by friend and creator of my TL;DR graphic, ** Bryan Mathers (https://twitter.com/bryanmmathers)

.

The research and anecdotal evidence in the piece give us opportunity to rethink and re-examine the role and opportunities for individuals with dyslexia.

** Star Wars is a postmodern masterpiece (http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/cover_story/2015/12/star_wars_is_a_pastiche_how_george_lucas_combined_flash_gordon_westerns.html)

Piece by ** Forrest Wickman (https://twitter.com/forrestw)

on ** Slate (http://www.slate.com/)

that discusses the pastiche that George Lucas created in the Star Wars space opera by melding together multiple narratives.

As we create, it is not only important to recognize the stories and culture that have come before, but it is also an opportunity to remix or mashup these to create something new.

** The best children's books of 2015 (https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/12/15/best-childrens-books-2015/)

Post by ** Maria Popova (https://twitter.com/brainpicker)

on ** BrainPickings (https://www.brainpickings.org/)

looking at the top children's books of the year.

As we examine the roots of creativity, and try to embed it in our own processes, I'm always struck by the work in incredible children's books. Definitely purchasing all of these for use in my grad classes this year.

** Pew Research report on gaming and gamers (http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/12/15/gaming-and-gamers/)

New insight from the ** Pew Research Center (http://www.pewresearch.org/)

on the real people that game and how this fits in to their lives.

Some of the intriguing findings:

* Equal numbers of men and women ever play video games, although men are twice as likely to call themselves “gamers”

* Four in ten adults believe that violence in vido games is related to violent behavior

* Among the general public, attitudes toward games are complex and often uncertain

* Compared with those how do not play video games, game players are more likely to agree with the positives and disagree with the negatives associated with games

## 🔨 Do

Over the last couple of months there are new options for live streaming from your mobile device. ** Live streaming (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestream)

is when you open up your camera and send the video and audio of whatever you're witnessing live out to the Internet.

** Periscope (https://www.periscope.tv/)

and ** Meerkat (https://meerkatapp.co/)

are two options for making this happen for free using your device and your data connection. Periscope is owned by Twitter...so there is extra support and funding to keep it alive.

As a viewer on either platform, you can open up the app and view any content that people choose to share. I've seen U2 concerts, people at UFC fighting events. I've even watched people sitting on their couches chatting. It's informal and ephemeral. Once the video stream is finished...many times it disappears.

As a new medium, there are many people experimenting with the tools. Teachers are trying to figure out what it could/should be. I think there are possibilities...but we need to be aware of the ** tremendous concerns (https://www.edsurge.com/news/2015-06-11-a-peek-at-periscope-s-potential-and-privacy-concerns-in-the-classroom)

before bringing it into our classrooms.

I recommend installing it on your phone and checking it out to see what is happening.

Creativity is piercing the mundane to find the marvelous.
