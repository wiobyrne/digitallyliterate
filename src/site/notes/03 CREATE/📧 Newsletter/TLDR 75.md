** Too Long; Didn't Read (TL;DR) newsletter #75

------------------------------------------------------------

Welcome to issue 75 of the TL;DR Newsletter.

In TL;DR we typically discuss events of the week in education, technology, and literacy. In this issue we take consider facts being louder than opinion.

1. Google, democracy and the truth about internet search (https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/04/google-democracy-truth-internet-search-facebook)

2. NCES releases PISA 2015 results (https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/pisa/pisa2015/index.asp)

3. Information overload? Not everybody is feeling it, Pew study says (http://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2016/12/07/504706640/information-overload-not-everybody-is-feeling-it-pew-study-says)

4. This chart shows how most computer literate most people are (https://lifehacker.com/this-chart-shows-how-computer-literate-most-people-are-1789761598)

5. Common Sense Media census measures plugged-in parents (https://www.commonsensemedia.org/blog/common-sense-media-census-measures-plugged-in-parents)

Make: Brain Breaks (https://www.edutopia.org/article/brain-breaks-restore-student-focus-judy-willis)

This week I spent time getting caught up following LRA closing out the fall semester. I had the privilege of speaking with a group of awesome educators in the SC Virtual Charter School (http://scvcs.k12.com/) . I'm looking forward to working with them to reconsider pedagogy in online & hybrid spaces.

I also launched a t-shirt on Teespring (http://wiobyrne.com/imho/2016/tenure-kryptonite) for some of my friends in academics. You should take a peek and see if you want to purchase one for yourself...or a friend.

## 📺 Watch

** A message to Breitbart from Weather.com (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhdymoRTz6M)

With some of the recent discussion about whether or not climate change is real or a hoax, it was interesting to see ** The Weather Channel release a rebuttal (https://weather.com/news/news/breitbart-misleads-americans-climate-change?cm_ven=T_WX_CD_120616_2)

to a ** Breitbart post (http://www.breitbart.com/london/2016/11/30/global-temperatures-plunge-icy-silence-climate-alarmists/)

indicating that global temperatures might be plummeting. The Weather Channel took issue with Breitbart "cherry picking" info from their content to "mislead Americans."

My favorite line from the video linked about asks scientists to make "facts louder than opinion."

## 📚 Read

This post from ** Carole Cadwalladr (https://twitter.com/carolecadwalla)

in ** The Guardian (https://www.theguardian.com/us)

came out last week as I was finalizing issue #74 of TL;DR. I decided to hold on to it for this week to think a bit more about the ideas presented.

In years past, we would play with ** Google autocomplete (https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/106230?hl=en)

to ** create found poems (http://hyperallergic.com/92737/the-found-poetry-of-google-autocomplete/)

...among other things. Cadwalladr revisited this tool and examined what would happen if you entered specific terms to see what the predictive algorithms would present. These terms included "Are jews...", "Are women...", "Are muslims...", etc. You can review the post to see the full extent of the presented results.

We've talked a bit in previous issues of TL;DR about the challenges of critically evaluating what we read online and the problems with filter bubbles. This challenge of autocomplete in Google is as damaging as we routinely ask Google for answers to our queries.

One of the key takeaways from this post is a quote from ** Danny Sullivan (https://twitter.com/dannysullivan)

of ** SearchEngineLand.com (http://searchengineland.com/)

:

This is the equivalent of going into a library and asking a librarian about Judaism and being handed 10 books of hate.

** The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) released PISA 2015 results (https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/pisa/pisa2015/index.asp)

This week the NCES released results from the 2015 PISA (Program for International Student Assessment). You probably don't know about the PISA...but you should. The PISA is an international assessment of 15-year olds that is given every three years. The PISA assesses science, reading, and mathematics.

I value the PISA results because it provides some insight into global educational trends. It is also helpful to see the ** types of items (https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/pisa/educators.asp)

used in the assessment.

The latest results suggest that average science and reading scores for U.S. 15-year-olds in 2015 were not measurably different from any of the previous comparison years, while mathematics literacy scores declined. Results also show average science and reading scores are not measurably different from the OECD average, while the mathematics average score was below the OECD average.

** Information overload? Not everybody is feeling it, Pew study says (http://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2016/12/07/504706640/information-overload-not-everybody-is-feeling-it-pew-study-says)

A ** new report from the Pew Research Center (http://www.pewinternet.org/2016/12/07/information-overload/)

includes findings from 1,520 U.S. adults aged 18 and older. The study suggests that generally American adults appreciate access to lots of information, and do not feel "overloaded" by this.

Other interesting trends:

* 80% say this statement describes them “very well” (41%) or “somewhat well” (40%): “Most of the time, it is easy for me to determine what information is trustworthy.”

* 79% say this statement describes them “very well” (44%) or “somewhat well” (35%): “Having a lot of information makes me feel like I have more control over things in my life.”

** This chart shows how most computer literate most people are (https://lifehacker.com/this-chart-shows-how-computer-literate-most-people-are-1789761598)

Horrible title from a Lifehacker post on a very important topic.

The international ** Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (https://www.oecd.org/)

(OECD) group conducted a study of 215,942 people across 33 countries from 2011 - 2015. The study tested the skills of people aged 16 - 65 to measure their basic computer literacy as it relates to job-related skills.

** These results suggest (https://www.nngroup.com/articles/computer-skill-levels/)

a rather large divide between the broad population and the more digitally savvy. 14% of the population cannot even effectively use computers. An example of a task at this level would ask participants to delete an email. Moving up a step into "Level 1" users included another 29% of the adult population. An example of a task in this area asks participants to reply all to an email.

** Common Sense Media census measures plugged-in parents (https://www.commonsensemedia.org/blog/common-sense-media-census-measures-plugged-in-parents)

This research from Common Sense Media provides a nice counter narrative to the regular panic about the screen time of children. These results suggest that parents are accounting for more than their fair share.

The research surveyed nearly 1,800 parents of U.S. tweens and teens to find that parents indicate that they spend more than nine hours per day with screen media. Eighty-two percent of that time (almost eight hours) is devoted to personal screen media activities such as watching TV, social networking, and video gaming, with the rest used for work.

## 🔨 Do

** Using brain breaks to restore students' focus (https://www.edutopia.org/article/brain-breaks-restore-student-focus-judy-willis)

This post from Edutopia suggests integrating quick learning activities known as "brain breaks" to allow your students to keep focused.

The post suggests that:

Brain breaks are planned learning activity shifts that mobilize different networks of the brain. These shifts allow those regions that are blocked by stress or high-intensity work to revitalize. Brain breaks, by switching activity to different brain networks, allow the resting pathways to restore their calm focus and foster optimal mood, attention, and memory.

Brain breaks might provide opportunities to ** ensure that students remain actively engaged (http://ww2.kqed.org/mindshift/2016/12/09/how-to-ensure-students-are-actively-engaged-and-not-just-compliant/)

in class.

## 🤔 Consider

I am a firm believer in the people. If given the truth, they can be depended upon to meet any national crisis. The great point is to bring them the real facts.
