# TLDR 47

## Too Long; Didn't Read Issue 47

**Published**: 2016-05-27 • [[03 CREATE/📧 Newsletter/📧 Newsletter\|📧 Newsletter]]

Welcome to issue 47 of the TL;DR Newsletter. This week we problematize Legos, gender, & grit.

If you have feedback, questions, or concerns...please feel free to the "reply" button and send me a response. Your feedback is greatly appreciated.

This week I spent some time cleaning up stuff in the background. One thing in particular that I've been working on is getting my podcast series up and off of the ground.

The [Four Questions For podcast](http://wiobyrne.com/4q4/content/all/) is a series of interviews I've conducted with experts in literacy, education, and technology over the past couple of years. You can subscribe on [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/four-questions-for-podcast/id1118019240), [Google Play](https://goo.gl/app/playmusic?ibi=com.google.PlayMusic&isi=691797987&ius=googleplaymusic&link=https://play.google.com/music/m/Iatnkr5kyn4awlgjz2v3vz6jaxe?t%3DFour_Questions_For_podcast), [Stitcher](http://www.stitcher.com/s?fid=91283&refid=stpr), or with your [favorite podcatcher](http://feeds.feedburner.com/4q4Podcast).

## 🔖 Key Takeaways

- **Remix is Not Dead**: Kirby once again details the elements of remix, and explains why it is a good thing. Finally...he indicates that remix is not dead. :)
- **I Appreciate the Focus**: I appreciate the focus from Lego (and researchers) on the interactions between play, product, and perception in these spaces.
- **Unexpected Takeaway**: If anything, being an adult and knowing realistic limits on what can and cannot be realized can actually limit your creativity. So consider the trade-off: If you want to become an architect, it might come at the expense of your Lego skills.
- **I Applaud Hypothes.is**: I applaud Hypothes.is for conducting and sharing this research. I look forward to further discussion about the subject.
- **As Always, I Recommend Problematizing**: As always, I recommend problematizing all elements and assumptions about our world...even grit.

## 📺 Watch

### [Everything is a Remix: The Force Awakens (10:34)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKvsc6a03Es)

For those of you into remix and mashups, you know about [Kirby Ferguson](https://twitter.com/remixeverything). I use his [Everything is a Remix video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJPERZDfyWc) to introduce the subject to my students.

If you're a Star Wars fan, and/or remix fan, this latest video is for you. Kirby once again details the elements of remix, and explains why it is a good thing. He also explains why many people were upset that The Force Awakens contain elements of a remix.

Finally...he indicates that remix is not dead. :)

### [How to play like a girl](http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/05/legos/484115/)

Intriguing post from [Adrienne LaFrance](https://twitter.com/AdrienneLaF) in [The Atlantic](http://www.theatlantic.com/) examining the line between making products children love and informing kids how they should play with them.

The piece starts with a discussion about the reframing of Lego to connect with girls and not be so skewed toward boys only. It continues on with [research](https://www.andrews.edu/~rbailey/Chapter%20one/9040385.pdf) about stereotyping of toys and gender on play assessment. Finally, it concludes with current initiatives from Lego as they try to make a product that is approachable for all learners without inadvertently informing their practice.

In the current culture, many are open to flexible definitions of gender. Still many others are not and debate rages from the role of transitioning adults to public bathroom designations. I appreciate the focus from Lego (and researchers) on the interactions between play, product, and perception in these spaces.

### [What architects make when they play with Lego](http://www.fastcodesign.com/3060157/what-architects-make-when-they-play-with-lego)

As we work and research digital spaces, I often wonder about what the "experts" with their tools.

Continuing the theme of working/playing with Lego, this post in [FastCo Design](http://www.fastcodesign.com/) discusses an event at the Lego Store in NYC in which professional architects were paired up with students from [a local high school](http://www.uasdc.org/). Their task was to rebuild/reinvent New York using monochrome Lego blocks.

Unexpected takeaway:

> Still, there were some at the event who felt, if anything, that becoming professional architects had somehow made them worse at Lego. "If anything, being an adult and knowing realistic limits on what can and cannot be realized can actually limit your creativity," Kushner says. So consider the trade-off: If you want to become an architect, it might come at the expense of your Lego skills.

### [Digital Redlining, Access, and Privacy](https://www.graphite.org/privacy/blog/digital-redlining-access-privacy)

An excellent, wide-ranging post from [Chris Gillard](https://www.graphite.org/users/chrisgilliard) and [Hugh Culik](https://www.graphite.org/users/hughculik) on [Common Sense Graphite](https://www.graphite.org/).

The authors create parallels between students trying to search online but being limited by firewalls and filters...and [redlining that occurred in the US with housing loans](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/05/the-racist-housing-policy-that-made-your-neighborhood/371439/). The authors contend that there is a new form of "digital redlining" that informs/creates/reifies artificial patterns of class structure by limiting access to knowledge sources online.

They continue:

> Digital redlining is not a renaming of [the digital divide](http://mag-net.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2015/12/factsheet_digital_divide.pdf). It is a different thing, a set of education policies, [investment decisions](https://backchannel.com/when-comcast-s-business-as-usual-turns-out-to-limit-minority-access-180fe19a4e46#.lug1fbaeh), and IT practices that actively create and maintain class boundaries through strictures that discriminate against specific groups. The digital divide is a noun; it is the consequence of many forces. In contrast, digital redlining is a verb, the "doing" of difference, a "doing" whose consequences reinforce existing class structures. In one era, redlining created differences in physical access to schools, libraries, and home ownership. Now, the task is to recognize how digital redlining is integrated into edtech to produce the same kinds of discriminatory results. Armed with the history of redlining, and understanding its digital resurrection, we glimpse the use of technologies to reinforce the boundaries of race, class, ethnicity, and gender. Our experience is that this problem is seldom recognized as an urgent educational issue.

### [Involving page owners in annotation](https://hypothes.is/blog/involving-page-owners-in-annotation/)

On TL:DR I frequently share news and info about [Hypothes.is](https://hypothes.is/), one of my favorite tools for annotating online texts. I use Hypothes.is to annotate and "save" online texts. I use it in classes. I even have it built in to my website to allow readers to mark up my site.

Recent criticisms ([here](http://observer.com/2016/03/genius-web-annotator-emma-dawson-alana-massey/), [here](http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2016/03/news_genius_wants_to_annotate_the_entire_web_at_what_cost.html), [here](http://glog.glennf.com/blog/2016/3/25/citation-appropriation-and-fair-use), and [here](http://www.newsweek.com/web-annotation-can-comment-any-page-should-you-452666)) have questioned whether we should be able to provide this level of annotation to the web.

This post from [Lena Gunn](https://twitter.com/lenazun) at Hypothe.is shares research with content creators to gain their opinion on the subject. I applaud Hypothes.is for conducting and sharing this research. I look forward to further discussion about the subject.

### [MacArthur 'genius' Angela Duckworth responds to a new critique of grit](http://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2016/05/25/479172868/angela-duckworth-responds-to-a-new-critique-of-grit)

If you listened to [episode 52 of the TIDE Podcast](http://tidepodcast.org/post/144847039977/episode-52), you know that the topic of "grit" as identified by Angela Duckworth has been critiqued recently. You can read more [here](http://www.psypost.org/2016/05/no-evidence-grit-improves-performance-42944) and [here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2016/05/10/the-problem-with-teaching-grit-to-poor-kids-they-already-have-it-heres-what-they-really-need/).

At the root of this critique is a meta-analysis of research by [Marcus Crede](https://www.psychology.iastate.edu/directory/faculty/crede-marcus/) on grit in an upcoming issue of the [Journal of Personality and Social Psychology](http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/psp/).

Grit is frequently tossed around in educational circles as we discuss the merit and implications of this [construct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construct_(philosophy)). It's interesting to see how people are responding to this discussion about grit in our lives. As always, I recommend problematizing all elements and assumptions about our world...even grit.

## 🔨 Do

### [Labeley makes good-looking custom labels for anything, no Photoshop knowledge required](http://lifehacker.com/labeley-makes-good-looking-custom-labels-for-anything-1776589316)

One of my favorite tools to use is [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) to quickly make good looking digital designs. I use it to create all of the "Consider" quotes that you see below...and that I publish on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/wiobyrne/).

Labeley takes a page out of this playbook by improving their web editing portal that you can use to print out your own custom labels.

When I brew my own beer, I design my own labels and print them up on store bought labels. I then cover these up with many layers of hairspray. In the future I'll start using Labeley to not only create better labels...but more stickers for my laptop.
