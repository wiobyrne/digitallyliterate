### ["I Have Blood on My Hands": A Whistleblower Says Facebook Ignored Global Political Manipulation](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/facebook-ignore-political-manipulation-whistleblower-memo)

After being fired by Facebook this month, a data scientist published a 6,600-word memo to the company's internal communication systems breaking down 2.5 years of her experiences on the "fake engagement team."

Former Facebook data scientist Sophie Zhang pointed to activity across the world in nations such as Azerbaijan, Honduras, India, Ukraine, Spain, Bolivia, and Ecuador.

### [The U.S. Has an Empathy Deficit](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-us-has-an-empathy-deficit/)

Here's what we can do about it:

- Take the time to ask those you encounter how they are feeling, and really listen. Try to put yourself in their shoes. Remember that we all tend to underestimate other people's emotional distress, and we're most likely to do so when those people are different from us.
- Remind yourself that almost everyone is at the end of their rope these days. Many people barely have enough energy to handle their own problems, so they don't have their normal ability to think about yours.
- Be aware that what is empathy for one person may not be empathy for another person. It's not a concept that speaks for itself. Asking your friends, family, and coworkers what empathy is for them might open a new door to understanding and helping those around us.

### [How microaggressions look different when we're working remotely](https://www.fastcompany.com/90551236/how-microaggressions-look-different-when-were-working-remotely)

According to Columbia professor [Derald Wing Sue](https://www.cpedv.org/sites/main/files/file-attachments/how_to_be_an_effective_ally-lessons_learned_microaggressions.pdf), whose team defined microaggressions as the "new face of racism" in 2007, these actions fit into one of three categories:

- *Microassault:* an explicit racial derogation; verbal/nonverbal. For example, using racial slurs or refusing to work with someone because of their race, ethnicity, or national origin.
- *Microinsult:* communication that conveys rudeness and demeans a person's racial heritage or identity; subtle snubs, unknown to the perpetrator; hidden insulting message to the recipient. For example, telling someone they are not like others of their race or repeating an insensitive joke about the person's ethnicity.
- *Microinvalidation:* communication that excludes or negates the psychological thoughts, feelings, or experiential reality of a person belonging to a particular group. This could include telling a person that they are being too sensitive or that they took your joke the wrong way.

### [An Open Letter to a Parent Afraid of Anti-Racist Education](https://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2020/09/18/an-open-letter-to-a-parent-afraid.html)

The Education Week invited [Julie Gunlock](https://www.iwf.org/people/julie-gunlock/), the Director of the [Independent Women's Forum](https://www.iwf.org/) to write [a blog post](http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/rick_hess_straight_up/2020/09/public_schools_and_pushing_politics.html) that sparked a lot of outrage in the comments on the post, as well as Twitter.

As a response to this post, [Christina Torres](https://twitter.com/biblio_phile) wrote [this open letter](https://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2020/09/18/an-open-letter-to-a-parent-afraid.html) as a response that suggests that Black Lives Matter does belong in the classroom.

A great piece by [Kate Bowles](http://musicfordeckchairs.com/), [Mia Zamora](https://miazamoraphd.com/), [Autumn Caines](https://autumm.org/), and [Maha Bali](https://blog.mahabali.me/) map a possible path to the end of working in the pandemic university.

**Connected concepts**:
- [[Facebook Global Political Manipulation\|Facebook Global Political Manipulation]] - Sophie Zhang's "I have blood on my hands" whistleblower memo exposes how Facebook's fake engagement team documented political manipulation across Azerbaijan, Honduras, India, Ukraine, Spain, Bolivia, and Ecuador—then did nothing. Her firing after publishing the 6,600-word internal memo reveals the company prioritizes reputation management over democratic integrity. This connects to patterns where Facebook treats political manipulation as a PR problem rather than existential threat to global democracy.
- [[Microaggressions in Remote Work Environments\|Microaggressions in Remote Work Environments]] - Derald Wing Sue's 2007 framework defining microaggressions as "the new face of racism" takes on new dimensions in virtual spaces. The three categories (microassault, microinsult, microinvalidation) manifest differently when working remotely—from who gets muted in meetings to whose backgrounds get commented on. This connects to broader questions about whether remote work reduces or merely relocates workplace discrimination, and how virtual environments create new vectors for subtle exclusion.
- [[Anti-Racist Education as Pedagogy Not Politics\|Anti-Racist Education as Pedagogy Not Politics]] - Christina Torres' open letter defending Black Lives Matter in classrooms challenges the framing that teaching racial justice constitutes political indoctrination. The controversy sparked by Education Week platforming opposition voices reveals ongoing battles over whose reality gets centered in curriculum. This connects to critical pedagogy debates about whether teaching historical and contemporary racism is political advocacy or basic educational integrity.
