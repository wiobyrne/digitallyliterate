Hi all, welcome back to Digitally Literate and issue 260.

This week I worked on the following:

- [Ikigai](https://wiobyrne.com/ikigai/) - Some thoughts about Ikigai, the Japanese concept around a "reason for being" as I think about my social signals—and life.
- [Joy, Love, & Aesthetic Fulfillment](https://wiobyrne.com/joy-love-aesthetic-fulfillment/) - When was the last time you honestly felt pure joy? When was the last time you felt fulfilled?
- [Re-Examining My Social Signals](https://wiobyrne.com/re-examining-my-social-signals/) - An update on how I'm thinking about re-engineering, reconnecting, or disconnecting the texts, places, and spaces in which I engage online.
- [Using Graphic Novels in Your Classroom](https://wiobyrne.com/using-graphic-novels-in-your-classroom/) - Some ideas about how to embed these wonderful texts into your learning spaces.

### [Facebook Whistleblower Memo](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/facebook-ignore-political-manipulation-whistleblower-memo)

After being fired by Facebook this month, a data scientist published a 6,600-word memo to the company's internal communication systems breaking down 2.5 years of her experiences on the "fake engagement team."

Former Facebook data scientist Sophie Zhang pointed to activity across the world in nations such as Azerbaijan, Honduras, India, Ukraine, Spain, Bolivia, and Ecuador.

### [The U.S. Has an Empathy Deficit](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-us-has-an-empathy-deficit/)

Here's what we can do about it:

- Take the time to ask those you encounter how they are feeling, and really listen. Try to put yourself in their shoes. Remember that we all tend to underestimate other people's emotional distress, and we're most likely to do so when those people are different from us.
- Remind yourself that almost everyone is at the end of their rope these days. Many people barely have enough energy to handle their own problems, so they don't have their normal ability to think about yours.
- Be aware that what is empathy for one person may not be empathy for another person. Asking your friends, family, and coworkers what empathy is for them might open a new door to understanding.

### [How Microaggressions Look Different When We're Working Remotely](https://www.fastcompany.com/90551236/how-microaggressions-look-different-when-were-working-remotely)

According to Columbia professor [Derald Wing Sue](https://www.cpedv.org/sites/main/files/file-attachments/how_to_be_an_effective_ally-lessons_learned_microaggressions.pdf), whose team defined microaggressions as the "new face of racism" in 2007, these actions fit into one of three categories:

- **Microassault**: an explicit racial derogation; verbal/nonverbal. Using racial slurs or refusing to work with someone because of their race.
- **Microinsult**: communication that conveys rudeness and demeans a person's racial heritage; subtle snubs, unknown to the perpetrator.
- **Microinvalidation**: communication that excludes or negates the psychological thoughts, feelings, or experiential reality of a person belonging to a particular group.

### [An Open Letter to a Parent Afraid of Anti-Racist Education](https://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2020/09/18/an-open-letter-to-a-parent-afraid.html)

Education Week invited Julie Gunlock, Director of the Independent Women's Forum, to write a blog post that sparked outrage in the comments and on Twitter.

As a response, [Christina Torres](https://twitter.com/biblio_phile) wrote this open letter suggesting that Black Lives Matter does belong in the classroom.

### [Bodies of Work: Critical Labour Literacy in the Post-Pandemic University](https://postpandemicuniversity.net/2020/09/16/bodies-of-work-a-proposal-for-critical-labour-literacy-in-the-post-pandemic-university/)

A great piece by Kate Bowles, Mia Zamora, Autumn Caines, and Maha Bali mapping a possible path to the end of working in the pandemic university.

## 🤔 Consider

### Real change, enduring change, happens one step at a time.

*Ruth Bader Ginsburg*

RBG's passing this week reminds us that transformation isn't about dramatic gestures—it's about persistent, incremental work. The empathy deficit, the microaggressions, the resistance to anti-racist education—these won't be solved in a single moment. But each step matters.
