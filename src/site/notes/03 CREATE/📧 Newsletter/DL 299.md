## [Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger - Daft Punk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHu0ALxqUIo)

I don't know how the YouTube algorithm took this long to bring me the [Scary Pockets YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-2JUs_G21BrJ0efehwGkUw)...but I am thankful.

I watched almost all of the videos on the channel with the family this week.

## [Pegasus Spyware Exposed](https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/interactive/2021/nso-spyware-pegasus-cellphones/)

Human rights activists, journalists, and lawyers across the world have been targeted by authoritarian governments using hacking software sold by the Israeli surveillance company NSO Group.

Pegasus is malware that infects iPhones and Android devices to enable operators of the tool to extract messages, photos and emails, record calls, and secretly activate microphones.

The leak contains a list of more than 50,000 phone numbers that, it is believed, have been identified as those of people of interest by clients of NSO since 2016.

[The Pegasus Project reports that journalists, activists, and heads of state could have been infiltrated](https://www.theverge.com/22589942/nso-group-pegasus-project-amnesty-investigation-journalists-activists-targeted).

## [Bodycams for Teachers?](https://www.wired.com/story/the-absurd-proposal-to-put-bodycams-on-teachers-is-feasible/)

The idea to monitor educators so they don't teach critical race theory seems ridiculous. But schools are already rife with invasive surveillance.

As outlandish as the body camera proposal is, we've already spent years shifting the [Overton Window of acceptability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window) in favor of more invasive surveillance in schools.

The proposal is insulting, exhausting, and un-American, but it is not impossible. One Texas school district's facial recognition system is [capable of capturing a single student's image more than 1000 times a week](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20210710/20581547149/texas-school-districts-facial-recognition-system-capable-capturing-single-students-image-more-than-1000-times-week.shtml).

## [Tech's Pandemic Boom](https://www.nytimes.com/2021-07-23/technology/silicon-valleys-pandemic-profits.html)

Tech giants profited immensely during the pandemic, shaping how we live and work.

These companies now hold unprecedented influence, raising questions about equity, privacy, and long-term societal impacts.

## [Managing Feedback on Open Projects](https://opensource.com/open-organization/21/7/manage-feedback-open-project)

When you post content openly online and ask for feedback...you just may get it.

The brilliant [Laura Hilliger](https://www.laurahilliger.com/) and her team are working on [a definition for open leadership](https://github.com/open-organization/editorial/issues/94).

The team is using [a Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ETyMtoNK9MpkTOm2wUvqBBtcnf1S6wGWOUPvOYFyrx8/edit#gid=0) to keep track of comments and identify how they've addressed changes. I value how the team has developed and documented their process openly.

## [The Neuroscience of Conversation](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-neuroscience-of-taking-turns-in-a-conversation/)

[Research in birds](https://www.pnas.org/content/118/23/e2018188118) suggests that when one partner speaks, the other partner's brain is inhibited from talking over them.

Findings also suggest that when individuals are interacting in a shared behavior they act as a single entity. This concept is important for any group of organisms cooperating to produce a shared behavior that is more than the sum of its parts; for example, people dancing the tango, or several people playing in band. To coordinate behavior, the brains of all participants must link together to become a single unit.

### Newsletter Evolution Note
DL 299 represents a fascinating moment in the newsletter's development - the shift from simple tech curation toward examining the deeper societal implications of digital surveillance. The Pegasus spyware revelations and teacher bodycam proposals show how quickly dystopian concepts move from science fiction to policy discussion. This issue captures the growing urgency around digital privacy that would become central to later newsletter analysis.
