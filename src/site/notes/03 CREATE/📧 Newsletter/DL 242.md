Hi all, welcome to issue 242 of Digitally Literate.

I helped post the following this week:

- [Has Screentime "Won"?](https://screentime.me/has-screentime-won/) - In this episode of the [Technopanic Podcast](https://screentime.me/technopanic-podcast/), Kristen and I talk about the recent news suggesting that screentime is no longer a problem during social distancing.
- [Teacher Mom, Mom Teacher](https://literacy6-12.org/teacher-mom/) - As part of the Literacy in the Disciplines research group, we've started up a blog feed. This post by [Elinor Lister](https://twitter.com/ElinorLister) considers the challenges as we juggle the role of parent and educator.

## 📺 Watch

### [Netflix Opens Educational Documentaries on YouTube](https://media.netflix.com/en/company-blog/free-educational-documentaries)

Kudos to Netflix! They've moved many of their documentaries and educational programming to a YouTube channel to make it easier to share in online learning environments. [Read the announcement here](https://media.netflix.com/en/company-blog/free-educational-documentaries).

This is precisely the kind of corporate response that serves the public good—reducing barriers to quality educational content when it's most needed, without complicated licensing negotiations.

## 📚 Read

### [Teaching Through Pandemic in an Unjust World](https://www.chronicle.com/)

There are things we can do as we attempt to move through a global pandemic in an unjust world:

- Be kind to our students
- Don't fall into a deficit mindset
- Also, be kind to ourselves
- Remember what this outbreak revealed when things go back to normal

### [COVID-19 and Children's Digital Privacy](https://www.unicef.org/globalinsight/stories/covid-19-and-childrens-digital-privacy)

The unprecedented scope of current digital measures is pushing the limits of privacy. How do we balance children's right to privacy with their right to health, both enshrined in the Convention on the Rights of the Child?

> How do we use the technology and data available to combat the outbreak now, without creating a 'new normal' where children's privacy is under constant threat?

The pandemic accelerates surveillance infrastructure that may prove difficult to dismantle once the crisis passes.

### [Screen Time Is Replacing Playtime—And That's Changing Kids' Brains](https://www.discovermagazine.com/mind/screen-time-is-replacing-playtime-and-thats-changing-kids-brains)

This post in Discover Magazine has a clickbait title that does little to assuage parental fears about screentime during current times. If you click through and actually read the piece, it is more measured as it considers how we're still trying to figure out the ultimate effects.

The guidance buried at the end:

- Remember toddlers are not small grown-ups
- Go slow
- Help children choose their own content
- Keep devices in a central location
- Don't lose sight of real-world experiences

In this same vein, perhaps the focus should be on [child, content, and context](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/13/parenting/manage-screen-time-coronavirus.html). [Research suggests](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/04/200413103532.htm) that time on screens may have little impact on kids' social skills.

### [Social-Media Companies Must Flatten the Curve of Misinformation](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01107-z)

[Joan Donovan](https://twitter.com/BostonJoan) with a piece in Nature examining how the pandemic lays bare the failure to quarantine online scams, hoaxes, and lies amid political battles.

This week showed evidence of these challenges as [Facebook says it will begin to alert users](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/facebook-will-start-notifying-users-who-interact-coronavirus-misinformation-n1185146) after they've been exposed to misinformation about the coronavirus. We don't know if this will happen. I'm also interested in why some misinformation is better or worse than others. I guess it matters who is paying for it.

We also see some of this information in social spaces being [picked up in online extremist communities](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/trump-s-liberate-tweets-extremists-see-call-arms-n1186561).

### [What Does Digital Civic Engagement Mean in the Era of COVID-19](https://clalliance.org/blog/what-does-digital-civic-engagement-mean-in-the-era-of-covid-19/)

There is a large corpus of existing research that can help us think through this current moment with regard to the relationship between the civic, the digital, and (not exclusively) youth.

This [policy brief](https://www.unicef.org/globalinsight/reports/digital-civic-engagement-young-people) synthesizes key trends with an aim to present them in a useful and accessible way for policy makers, administrators, and anyone else interested in this topic.

Two highlights:

1. Let's work beyond critiques of "clicktivism" and instead apply useful, research-backed frameworks for analysis and scope.
2. It's incredibly important to heed equity issues and local context.

## 🔨 Do

### [Get Creative Zoom Backgrounds](https://unsplash.com/backgrounds/apps/zoom)

Perfect for those times you are supposed to be in the meeting but really don't want to be in the meeting.

If you're looking for different backgrounds for meetings, [Unsplash is developing a curated collection](https://unsplash.com/backgrounds/apps/zoom). Sometimes a small change in visual environment helps maintain sanity through meeting number seventeen of the day.

## 🤔 Consider

### Hurt people hurt people. That's how pain patterns get passed on, generation after generation after generation. Break the chain today. Meet anger with sympathy, contempt with compassion, cruelty with kindness.

*Yehuda Berg*

Berg's observation connects to the issue's title—"stepping on people"—and the misinformation challenge. Those spreading harmful content are often themselves afraid, uncertain, seeking control. Understanding this doesn't excuse the harm but opens paths beyond simply removing posts.
