**Published**: March 14, 2020 • [[03 CREATE/📧 Newsletter/📧 Newsletter\|📧 Newsletter]]

Welcome to *Digitally Literate*, issue 237. Your go-to source for insightful content on education, technology, and the digital landscape.

## 🔖 Key Takeaways
- **Online Pedagogy Needs Ethos, Not Just Tools**: Sean Michael Morris reminds us that the "what and why" of online pedagogy matters more than just the "how" as institutions scramble to go remote
- **Social Distancing Brings Loneliness Risk**: CDC guidelines for community mitigation may prevent pandemic spread but could cause "social recession" among already vulnerable populations
- **Screentime Research Has Limits**: Studies examining screen use and behavior are difficult to design and execute, leaving us with correlations rather than causal conclusions
- **Knapsack Problem Is Everywhere**: This computational thinking concept—optimizing what fits in limited space—appears in everything from packing to daily decision-making
- **SCARF Builds Team Trust**: Status, Certainty, Autonomy, Relationships, and Fairness are the five ingredients of psychological safety that Google found matters most for team performance

### [Think Like a Coder - TED-Ed Series](https://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-prison-break-think-like-a-coder-ep-1)

Think Like a Coder is a 10-episode series that challenges viewers with programming puzzles as the main characters—a girl and her robot companion—attempt to save a world that has been plunged into turmoil. In our digital age, coding has become a basic literacy skill which gives us deeper understanding of the technology we use everyday.

[Follow along with the lessons for episode one](https://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-prison-break-think-like-a-coder-ep-1) on the TED-Ed website. I'm using this as a challenge with my kids as we're remaining sequestered over the next week or so.

### [If You're Teaching Suddenly Online, Please Read This](https://www.seanmichaelmorris.com/)

Communities across the globe are feeling the effects of the Coronavirus this week. If you're sick and tired of reading about COVID-19, I don't blame you. I'll try to provide a balanced mixture of info about the global pandemic as I share the news of the week.

One of the most insightful pieces about planning for instruction as educational institutions move to online-only offerings comes from [Sean Michael Morris](https://www.seanmichaelmorris.com/). The post shares valuable insight on the ethos—the what and why of online pedagogy—as opposed to just focusing on the how.

### [Coronavirus Will Also Cause a Loneliness Epidemic](https://www.vox.com/2020/3/12/21173938/coronavirus-covid-19-social-distancing-elderly-epidemic-isolation-quarantine)

This week, the CDC issued [guidelines for "community mitigation strategies"](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/community-mitigation-strategy.pdf) to limit COVID-19 spread, including recommendations for "[social distancing](https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2020/03/coronavirus-what-does-social-distancing-mean/607927/)"—a conscious effort to reduce close contact between people.

[Ezra Klein](https://twitter.com/ezraklein) indicates this may prevent the pandemic from worsening, but may also cause a "social recession" in which populations already vulnerable to isolation and loneliness may be at extreme risk.

In earlier issues, we've examined possible negative impacts of digital spaces on relationships and mental health. As I connect with others online, I'm encouraged by what I see, but also trying to identify ways to support others' mental health and stay connected.

### [What Does a Screen Do?](https://slate.com/technology/2020/03/screen-time-research-correlation-causation.html)

As a member of the [Screentime Research Group](https://screentime.me/), I spend a lot of time thinking, talking, and writing about the challenges of living and learning in the age of screens.

This post in Slate by [jane c. hu](https://twitter.com/jane_c_hu) indicates that research examining screentime and behavior is difficult to design and execute, leaving us with fewer causal conclusions and more associative studies to rely on for decision-making and policy.

### [How the Mathematical Conundrum Called the 'Knapsack Problem' Is All Around Us](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/why-knapsack-problem-all-around-us-180974333/)

The [knapsack problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem) is a fictional dilemma in which you are constrained to fill a fixed-size knapsack with your most valuable items.

This thought experiment provides new opportunities for engaging in computing and processing tasks. It also gives us an opportunity to think about computational thinking and real-life problems.

Humans may struggle with optimizing multiple smaller problems due to "choice overload." But we've also learned how to store only the most pertinent stimuli in our mental knapsacks as we go through the day. Computers aren't there yet.

### [Build Trust in Your Team with SCARF](https://teamwork.guide/scarf/)

[Google crunched the data](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html) on hundreds of high-performing teams and found that one variable mattered more than any other: "emotional safety"—also known as psychological security, or trust.

Researcher David Rock studied the [brain science of trust and engagement at work](https://www.strategy-business.com/article/09306?gko=9efb2) and breaks it down into 5 key ingredients—SCARF:

- **Status**: A sense of importance and belonging
- **Certainty**: Clarity; an ability to predict what will happen
- **Autonomy**: Agency; a sense of freedom and control; being treated like an adult
- **Relationships**: Connecting on a personal level; feeling like we know each other
- **Fairness**: The rules are fairly applied; things are above-board

## 🔨 Do

### [Three Tactics for Better Focus](https://hbr.org/)

These three tactics will help you focus on the task at hand:

- Reimagining the trigger as a sensation of curiosity
- Reimagining the task itself
- Avoiding self-limiting beliefs regarding your temperament

As we navigate new work-from-home realities, focus becomes both more difficult and more essential.

## 🤔 Consider

### Change your thoughts and you change your world.

*Norman Vincent Peale*

Peale's reminder about the power of perspective connects to this week's themes. As the world shifts to social distancing and remote everything, our mental framing determines whether we experience isolation or intentional connection, whether online learning feels like a poor substitute or a new opportunity.
