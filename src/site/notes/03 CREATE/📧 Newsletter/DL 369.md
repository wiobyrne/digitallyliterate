## 📚 This Week’s Highlights

### 1. **Cormac McCarthy on Love & Survival**
This week began with wiring new outlets in the garage, listening to [The Road](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Road). Soon after, I learned of Cormac McCarthy’s passing at 89. His love for his son inspired _The Road_, a profound meditation on survival and humanity.

📺 [Watch a reflection on _The Road_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lhz52REeUUA)

**Why this matters:** McCarthy’s work reminds us of the resilience and hope needed to navigate life’s hardships.

### 2. **The Demographic Shift in Education**
The declining school-age population in America will affect public schools, colleges, and communities. This trend could lead to school closures, consolidations, and reduced access to quality education for vulnerable students.

**Why this matters:** While culture wars dominate the discourse, hard decisions about the future of education are looming.

### 3. **Libraries: Evolving Social Infrastructure**
Every summer, my kids and I participate in the local library’s reading challenges. Libraries remain vital community hubs, yet they face increasing demand and resource challenges.

**Why this matters:** Supporting libraries ensures they continue to serve as spaces for connection and learning.

### 4. **Social Media & Teen Mental Health**
Teenagers’ social media use is under scrutiny, but proving its impact on mental health is complex. Is the issue screen time itself, or the activities it replaces, like sleep and exercise?

**Why this matters:** Setting boundaries and fostering conversations about responsible use can help mitigate risks.

### 5. **The AI Revolution**
[Tim Urban](https://waitbutwhy.com/) explores the journey from Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI) to Artificial Superintelligence (ASI). As we approach 2025, computational power may rival the human brain, heralding unprecedented change.

📖 [Dive into the future of AI](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html)

**Why this matters:** Understanding and preparing for these advancements is critical as we navigate an uncertain future.

### 6. **Implementing Change Strategically**
To drive change, focus on early adopters rather than convincing everyone at once. Success within a small group can snowball into widespread transformation.

📖 [Read about strategic change](https://hbr.org/2023/05/to-implement-change-you-dont-need-to-convince-everyone-at-once)

**Why this matters:** Incremental successes build momentum for lasting change.
