# TLDR 143

## Too Long; Didn't Read Issue 143

**Published**: 2018-03-30 • [[03 CREATE/📧 Newsletter/📧 Newsletter\|📧 Newsletter]]

Welcome to Issue 143. This week we focus and try to keep it simple.

Last week we spent a lot of time digging in to the news related to Cambridge Analytica, Facebook, and your data. This week we'll talk about some of the continuing discussions in this space...but we'll also get back to a somewhat normal issue.

Here's what I posted this week:
- [Text tradeoffs as we move from print to pixel](http://wiobyrne.com/text-tradeoffs/) - This post shares some of the theories behind the changes occurring to text as we move online, and the need for "ambiguity" as we think about these concepts.
- [Examining your impressions](http://wiobyrne.com/examining-your-impressions/) - This post shares some Stoic guidance as we think about how to deal when things don't go the way that we planned.

Please [subscribe](http://wiobyrne.us11.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=7b5ee323a16720dad25ff96ff&id=17e92a2ae1) to make sure this comes to your inbox each week. You can review [archives of the newsletter](http://us11.campaign-archive1.com/home/?u=7b5ee323a16720dad25ff96ff&id=17e92a2ae1) or on [Medium](https://medium.com/tldr-newsletter).

## 🔖 Key Takeaways

- **Humanoid Robotics Progressing**: Sophia the Robot by Hanson Robotics demonstrates advances in social robotics with awkward Will Smith date video showing current state while highlighting continued development needs for natural human-robot interaction.
- **Scandal Bigger Than Just Facebook**: Facebook's data scandal extends far beyond Cambridge Analytica to Google and other companies doing equal or worse with your data, with real concern being unseen companies buying data plus ISPs watching browsing habits connected to billing info.
- **Saving Social Media's Dream**: Kevin Roose argues original dream of social media—healthy discussions, unlocking creativity, connecting similar interests—shouldn't be discarded because of current market leaders' failures, calling for better alternatives rather than abandoning the concept.
- **Apple Lost Education Market**: Apple's 2018 education event criticized for missing reality with expensive iPad strategy when schools already shifted to Chromebooks, with educators recommending inexpensive Chromebook plus cheap tablet costing less than single iPad for better functionality.
- **Ideal Learning Environment Principles**: Architecture of future learning environments guided by five common design principles—technology integration, safety and security, transparency, multipurpose space, and outdoor learning—requiring rethinking beyond traditional classroom models.
- **Five Learning Theory Myths**: Research debunks common educational assumptions: lecture capture doesn't decrease attendance, younger students aren't digital natives, multiple choice tests can assess beyond memorization, individual learning styles lack evidence, and flipped learning is more than just watching videos.

### [Will meets Sophia the Robot in the Cayman Islands](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml9v3wHLuWI)

[Sophia](http://sophiabot.com/) is an advanced social robot in her second year of development by [Hanson Robotics](http://www.hansonrobotics.com/). In this video, she's on a date in the Cayman Islands with actor Will Smith.

Awkward video aside...it's interesting to check in with the developments in humanoid robotics.

### [This is so much bigger than Facebook](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/03/data-misuse-bigger-than-facebook/556310/)

As we discussed last week in TL;DR, one of the common reactions is a knee-jerk "I'm deleting my account and leaving Facebook." I personally do not agree with this assessment of the situation, although I support your decision.

Facebook's data scandal Is bigger than Cambridge Analytica (Or Facebook). [BuzzFeed indicates](https://www.buzzfeed.com/charliewarzel/why-facebooks-data-scandal-just-wont-quit?utm_term=.lbAWLnO6Rz#.uwYDEVr6m8) "It's a moment that forces us, collectively, to step back and think about what we sacrificed for a more convenient & connected world."

I agree with the statements made by [Siva Vaidhyanathan](https://twitter.com/sivavaid). "If the people who care the most about privacy, accountability - civil discourse evacuate Facebook in disgust, the entire platform becomes even less informed & diverse. Deactivation is the opposite of activism."

### [Can social media be saved?](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/28/technology/social-media-privacy.html?mtrref=undefined&gwh=D3577E6EF8437F0D3AE2D4384177E78C&gwt=pay)

[Kevin Roose](https://twitter.com/kevinroose)'s piece in the NY Times examines the fallout underway as we take a deeper look the role and responsibility of digital, social networks.

Some of the response from these revelations is that [Zuckerberg and Facebook are being pilloried](https://mondaynote.com/mark-zuckerberg-thinks-were-idiots-638c64dfab12) while [Apple and others are distancing themselves](https://www.cultofmac.com/537505/mark-zuckerberg-should-have-listened-to-steve-jobs-privacy-advice/) from the wreckage. Facebook is trying (insufficiently IMHO) to [make it easier for you to understand](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/28/technology/facebook-privacy-security-settings.html) what they're doing with your data.

Keep in mind, [this model](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/24/technology/google-facebook-data-privacy.html?mtrref=undefined&mtrref=www.nytimes.com&mtrref=www.nytimes.com&mtrref=www.nytimes.com&gwh=CE8BD8D6B1EF16A618BBD9E8D4883B81&gwt=pay) is bigger than just Facebook. Google and other companies are doing as much, or worse with your data. My concern is not Google, Facebook, and others that I give my data...my concern is the unseen/unknown companies that buy my data. Also, keep in mind that your biggest concern (in the U.S.) should be your Internet Service Provider (ISP). They're sucking up your data, watching your searching/browsing habits, connecting this to your billing info, and selling/giving this off to everyone.

Please also avoid the "technopanic" posts that want to scare you. [Posts like this](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/28/all-the-data-facebook-google-has-on-you-privacy) from The Guardian detail of the ways in which organizations (Google in this instance) are sucking up your data and info. The problem with posts like this is that they lump in a lot of the instances in which you actively provide Google (or other services) with your data. Yes, you can review this and be terrified at the amount these services know about you. But, perhaps a better route would be to [understand how these organizations are using our data](https://www.propublica.org/article/breaking-the-black-box-what-facebook-knows-about-you), and demand transparency in these transactions.

My favorite takeaway from Roose is:

> The original dream of social media — producing healthy discussions, unlocking new forms of creativity, connecting people to others with similar interests — shouldn't be discarded because of the failures of the current market leaders.

### [How Apple lost its place in the classroom](https://www.wired.com/story/how-apple-lost-its-place-in-the-classroom/)

This week Apple held their first education-focused event since 2012.

The event showed that the company wants to make a serious push back into the education sector. The centerpiece here is ["new" iPad](https://www.engadget.com/2018/03/27/apple-ipad-2018-hands-on/), a 9.7-inch tablet with Apple Pencil support that aims to woo educators everywhere. There's [a redesigned iWork suite](https://www.engadget.com/2018/03/27/apples-retooled-iwork-suite-includes-pencil-support/) that lets students doodle and create digital books within Pages; the Schoolwork app, for tracking schoolwork; and a kid-friendly tool for [coding AR](https://www.engadget.com/2018/03/27/apples-swift-playgrounds-will-let-kids-code-for-ar/). Apple is hoping that will be enough to win over schools.

Most of the [feedback on the event has been negative](https://9to5mac.com/2018/03/28/making-the-grade-why-apples-education-strategy-is-not-based-on-reality/) from educators. Yes, Apple is releasing a cheaper iPad, but these devices are still very expensive. I also think that Apple missed an opportunity years ago when Chromebooks started picking up speed in classrooms. When asked by institutions to identify the tools and platforms I would recommend they purchase, my advice is to buy an inexpensive Chromebook...and a cheap tablet. For the cost of a Chromebook and Android/Kindle tablet, you spend less money than the cost of one iPad.

I think there is a need for tablets like the iPad in some of our practices. I also have to admit that I'm intrigued by the Apple Pencil, and wondering what it would do for my workflow. But, most of my time/effort...and the time/effort of the students and educators I deal with happens on laptops.

### [The architecture of ideal learning environments](https://www.edutopia.org/article/architecture-ideal-learning-environments)

While we talk about learning tools of children in our schools...let's also talk about the spaces in which they connect. This post from [Edutopia](https://www.edutopia.org/) shares an exciting look at the key principles that guide the design of future learning environments.

The five common design principles include:
- Technology integration
- Safety and security
- Transparency
- Multipurpose space
- Outdoor learning

I definitely recommend clicking through to look at the artist renders and think about what this means for teaching, learning, and assessment.

### [5 myths and misconceptions in learning theory](http://blogs.sussex.ac.uk/tel/2018/03/27/5-myths-and-misconceptions-in-learning-theory/)

This post from the [Technology Enhanced Learning blog at the University of Sussex](http://blogs.sussex.ac.uk/tel/) spawned a great deal of debate over the past week.

The post details five myths in learning theory, and provides details to deconstruct them:
- **Myth**: Having lecture capture available decreases lecture attendance
- **Myth**: Younger generations of students are Digital Natives
- **Myth**: Multiple choice questions are only useful to test memorization of fact
- **Myth**: Everyone has an individual learning style that works best for them
- **Myth**: Flipped learning is just watching videos

Educators all have their favorite myth that gets them angry. The key is to review the contents of the post and think critically about these myths...and make sure you don't subscribe to them. Better yet...share them and discuss/debate with colleagues at your institution.

### [How to make pesto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCge2JLyFlM)

The weather is getting a bit warmer here in the southeast of the U.S. and I'm starting up my herb garden again. This is also a time to talk about one of my favorite outcomes of the herb garden...pesto. I use the tons of basil that we grow. I also add in extra mint, rosemary, and garlic.

This video is from the [You Suck at Cooking YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCekQr9znsk2vWxBo3YiLq2w). Pesto is super easy to make and it will taste much better than the stuff you buy in the store. Experiment...and enjoy. Let me know if you have any favorite recipes I can make as well.
