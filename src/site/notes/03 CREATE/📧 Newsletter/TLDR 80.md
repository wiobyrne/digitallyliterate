** Too Long; Didn't Read (TL;DR) newsletter #80

------------------------------------------------------------

Welcome to the 80th issue of the TL;DR Newsletter.

In TL;DR we discuss the news and events of the week as it relates to education, technology, and literacy. This space is always changing...and we're striving to change with it.

In this issue we'll try to make learning approachable.

This week I worked on the following:

* Text Disruption for Youth Disruptors: Using postmodern picture books to build healthy skepticism (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cm_klzldoVDWeLlTZWOMzwQHhaAUGDhim3oewjjZ_xU/edit#) - This is a revision of an article I co-wrote with good friend and TL;DR reader Susanne Murphy. In this piece we discuss the opportunities to use postmodern children's books as a tool to help learners build the critical media literacies they'll need in digital spaces.

* Digitally literate public intellectuals (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yj_hTv3uuaQWvfG7QBpijJPSkPKuzCJLWI3gx6VnnCY/edit) - This column shares some of my current thinking about the role of academics as public intellectuals in digital spaces. This piece is currently under review by Hybrid Pedagogy for their upcoming issue on The Scholarly & The Digital (http://www.digitalpedagogylab.com/hybridped/cfp-scholarly-digital/) .

## 📺 Watch

** David Bowie predicted in 1999 the impact of the Internet (6:26) (https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=13&v=LaHcOs7mhfU)

Intriguing interview with David Bowie from a BBC interview in which he discusses the impact of the Internet and possibilities as a communication medium. You can read more about this in ** this post (https://paleofuture.gizmodo.com/watching-david-bowie-argue-with-an-interviewer-about-th-1791017656)

from Gizmodo.

I'm very interested in Bowie's indication that these communication technologies have the potential to remove the barrier between audience and performer. He likens it to a concert in which the performer on the stage is more or less accompanying the audience as they connect with one another.

Bowie ends the interview by saying:

The idea that the piece of work is not finished until the audience comes to it and add their own interpretation. And what the piece of art is about is the grey space in the middle. That grey space in the middle is what the 21st century is going to be all about.

## 📚 Read

In last week's issue of TL;DR I took issue with the reports on the "Growing up Digital" research that was reported by The Guardian. This post from Quartz actually shares the links to the report from the study (** PDF (https://www.childrenscommissioner.gov.uk/sites/default/files/publications/Growing%20Up%20Digital%20Taskforce%20Report%20January%202017_0.pdf)

). The post also shares research (** PDF (https://www.ofcom.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0034/93976/Children-Parents-Media-Use-Attitudes-Report-2016.pdf)

) from Ofcom suggesting that more than half of 12 to 15-year olds in Britain are on Instagram.

This post also directs you to page 10 of the Growing up Digital report in which ** Jenny Afia (https://twitter.com/jennyafia)

, a privacy law expert, provides a re-write of Instagram's 17 page, 5,000 word terms of service that is easier for adults and children to understand.

I strongly recommend reading this if you, or your children/students, use Instagram.

** Screen time guidelines need to be built on evidence, not hype (https://www.theguardian.com/science/head-quarters/2017/jan/06/screen-time-guidelines-need-to-be-built-on-evidence-not-hype)

An "open letter" signed by a group of scientists investigating the intersection between screen time and child development. In this piece the researchers urge caution as we encounter "moral panic abut the impact of new technologies on our behavior and development.

They close with a ** link to guidelines (http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/66927/1/Policy%20Brief%2017-%20Families%20%20Screen%20Time.pdf)

(PDF) for parents to help explain the evidence in the decision...not "hyperbole and opinion."

** Could our faith in phones undermine our trust in humans? (https://www.fastcompany.com/3067201/pov/could-our-faith-in-phones-undermine-our-trust-in-humans)

Following the results of the U.S. elections, I've been thinking a lot about the connections that I have with people online...as opposed to the people that live right next door to me. Barack Obama's ** farewell address (https://www.whitehouse.gov/farewell)

evidenced this point as well as he indicated the need to go ** talk with people in real life (https://hyp.is/8-ZNBtmrEeawRXP-QAbmhg/www.whitehouse.gov/node/360231)

.

This past week I was walking the hallways on the way in to teach a class and noticed all of the students staring at their devices as they walked and waited for class to begin. It has me wondering about the challenges that this has on our beliefs and practices.

** How teachers learn to discuss racism (https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2017/01/how-teachers-learn-to-discuss-racism/512474/)

A piece from ** Melinda Anderson (https://twitter.com/mdawriter)

in ** The Atlantic (https://www.theatlantic.com/)

documenting work in urban ed programs as they prepare their students to deal with tough discussions they'll encounter.

The piece describes a series of perspectives that are quite nuanced as the programs try to unpack societal narratives, and create their own culture. Specifically, the representatives recognize that many people tense up, or latch on to a negative connotation when discussing race.

The key component is to ** disrupt and complexify...what they believe they know about race (https://hyp.is/hmHRVtmwEeaM3LOV1f6UeA/www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2017/01/how-teachers-learn-to-discuss-racism/512474/)

.

** Whoever said there's no such thing as a stupid question never looked carefully at a standardized test (http://www.alfiekohn.org/blogs/stupid/)

A good post from ** Alfie Kohn (https://twitter.com/alfiekohn)

on the challenges of items on standardized tests.

Kohn takes a look at the ways in which students respond to items, while considering what these results say about learners.

I most of all enjoy this quote:

** No newspaper, no politician, no parent or school administrator should ever assume that a test score is a valid and meaningful indicator without looking carefully at the questions on that test to ascertain that they’re designed to measure something of importance and that they do so effectively. (https://hyp.is/h8kYwNm0Eeale4_RESUeIA/www.alfiekohn.org/blogs/stupid/)

## 🔨 Do

** What should I buy for my new makerspace? (https://www.edsurge.com/news/2017-01-02-what-should-i-buy-for-my-new-makerspace-a-five-step-framework-for-making-the-right-purchases)

I'm in the process of working with some of my neighbors to build a makerspace in our garage to allow the local kids to tinker and build. The challenge is that it's difficult to know where to start and end in the purchases.

This post from ** Laura Fleming (https://twitter.com/LFlemingEDU)

is invaluable as it details the decisions you need to make as you frame and build your space. Fleming breaks down the following framework:

* Mobility - Free-range learning that increases equity & access

* Allows for open-ended exploration - Maximizes inquiry opportunities

* Knowledge of student needs, wants, & interests - Do your learners actually want to do this?

* Empowerment & engagement - Low barrier of entry for engagement while empowering all

* Relevance - Does it connect to school or global trends?

## 🤔 Consider

The difficulty lies not so much in developing new ideas as in escaping from old ones.
