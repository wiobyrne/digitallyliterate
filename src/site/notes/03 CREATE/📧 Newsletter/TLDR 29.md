** Where do good ideas come from (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NugRZGDbPFU)

This video from Steven Johnson discusses the time and intellectual space needed for innovation and truly good ideas.

** Teaching: Just like performing magic  (http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2016/01/what-classrooms-can-learn-from-magic/425100/)

Penn from the magic/entertainment duo of Penn & Teller discusses how performance and discomfort can come together to make education come alive.

The first job of a teacher is to make the student fall in love with the subject. That doesn’t have to be done by waving your arms and prancing around the classroom; there’s all sorts of ways to go at it, but no matter what, you are a symbol of the subject in the students’ minds.

** You don't know as much as you think: False expertise (http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/you-don-t-know-as-much-as-you-think-false-expertise/)

Post from Scientific American looking at the phenomenon of self-proclaimed experts and the likelihood that they will overclaim as they profess their knowledge.

The post is guided by ** research from Psychological Science (http://pss.sagepub.com/content/early/2015/07/14/0956797615588195.abstract)

that examines perceived as opposed to actual knowledge from content areas that people identify as an expertise. The takeaways indicate that if you think you're an expert in an area...you might want to keep studying and double-check your facts. If you're consulting with an "expert"...feel free to get a second-opinion.

Developing a growth mindset in teachers and staff

Over the past year or so we've heard much more about mindsets...and particularly "growth mindsets." Most of this work indicates the need to build this, but does not explicitly state "how" to do so. Furthermore, the guidance is usually about how to make this happen with our students...as opposed to teachers and staff.

This post cites work from Carol Dweck and Jackie Gerstein by identifying the need for modeling, creating new spaces for ideas, self-reflection, and formative feedback.

** From problem solver to innovator: Is the answer to disconnect? (http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/leadership_360/2016/01/from_problem_solver_to_innovator_is_the_answer_to_disconnect.html)

This post from the EdWeek blog identifies the challenges as we live in a connected society. One of the benefits in staying constantly connected is that we can keep in touch, stay educated, and enrich the lives of others.

Perhaps there is also a challenge in that this constant connection does not provide time or space for "downtime" or self-reflection. Perhaps it is these spaces of time spent being mindful, or disconnected that allow us to truly be creative and innovative.

** Twitter guide: How to do everything with Twitter (http://www.labnol.org/internet/twitter-guide-do-everything-with-twitter/4916/)

A great guide from ** Amit Agarwal (https://twitter.com/labnol)

looking at tools to make your life a bit more productive as you try to reach out and use Twitter.

I often have complaints from colleagues and educators as they try to understand/use Twitter. There is a certain amount of work you need to conduct to get Twitter running for you. This list is a bit long, but it provides a good sampling of links and tools to see how you can expand your use of the tool.

** agnetic Pixel Poetry (http://www.instructables.com/id/Magnetic-Pixel-Poetry/)

Very cool make from ** Instructables (http://www.instructables.com/)

member ** depotdevoid (http://www.instructables.com/member/depotdevoid/)

.

The main idea is to create a pixelated art version of the "magnetic poetry" sets we often see on people's refrigerator.

Collect a large sample of the thin, cheap magnets that restaurants, banks, and other business hand out. Spray paint the magnets with different colors and let dry. Finally, use a paper cutter to make uniform squares. Affix these to your fridge and get creative.

Thinking about putting these on my door at work. :)

## 🤔 Consider

Unless it comes unasked out of your heart and your mind and your mouth and your gut, don't do it.
