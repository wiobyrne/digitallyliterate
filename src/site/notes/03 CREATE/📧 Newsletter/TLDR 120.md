## 🔖 Key Takeaways

- **Do You Agree or Disagree**: Human nature will take over as the salacious is often sexier than facts. We can also not trust the businesses and industries that develop and facilitate these digital texts and tools to make changes that will significantly improve the situation.
- **Beginning to Understand**: We're beginning to understand that these tech companies and platforms don't have our best interests at heart. In many aspects, they're giving us what we want...or think we want.
- **Survey Indicates**: The survey indicates that 98 percent of homes have a mobile device such as a tablet or smartphone. Average time spent on devices by children 8 & under is up to 48 minutes per day in 2017.
- **I Agree But Truth**: I agree with the results from Alexander and Singer, but think that the truth is far murkier. I think there are ways that we (and our students) should and could be reading on screens. Merely moving print to a screen does not take into account complexities of new tools and practices.
- **This Is Something**: For those of you that regularly write and blog...Alexander and Singer's publishing strategy is something to pay attention to.
- **I'll Start Testing**: I'll start testing CheckMark over the remainder of the semester and report back. I'm interested to see if I can build in multiple saved overlays per assignment.

### [The future of truth and misinformation online](http://www.pewinternet.org/2017/10/19/the-future-of-truth-and-misinformation-online/)

This new report from the Pew Research Center focuses on expert opinions about the future of trust, truth, and misinformation online. I shared a link out to the survey here in TL;DR months ago.

The results are somewhat split as to whether or not the coming decade will see a reduction in false and misleading narratives online. Review [the full report here](http://assets.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/2017/10/19095643/PI_2017.10.19_Future-of-Truth-and-Misinformation_FINAL.pdf).

Do you agree or disagree with one of my quotes from the research:

> Human nature will take over as the salacious is often sexier than facts. There are multiple information streams, public and private, that spread this information online. We can also not trust the businesses and industries that develop and facilitate these digital texts and tools to make changes that will significantly improve the situation.

### [Silicon Valley is not your friend](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/10/13/opinion/sunday/Silicon-Valley-Is-Not-Your-Friend.html)

This piece from [Noam Cohen](https://twitter.com/noamcohen) in the [Sunday Review from the NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/section/opinion/sunday) crystalizes some of the thinking I've had over the past year about social networks and their use. Specifically, we're beginning to understand that these tech companies and platforms don't have our best interests at heart.

I've heard from many colleagues and friends recently that they're thinking about "taking a break" from social media and these networks. I indicate that there is a lot of research (and previous news stories) that suggests that these companies are looking for clicks over our health and welfare. In many aspects, they're giving us what we want...or think we want.

Years ago, many of us that research and write and live in these digital spaces pulled out of Facebook, Twitter, and other spaces. The complaint was that they were playing it "fast and loose" with our digital info and identity. Now, it appears the concerns might be much more dire.

### [Young children are spending much more time in front of small screens](http://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2017/10/19/558178851/young-children-are-spending-much-more-time-in-front-of-small-screens)

This post from Anya Kamenetz on NPR Ed shares results from research report released this week from Common Sense Media. Review [the full report from Common Sense here](https://www.commonsensemedia.org/research/the-common-sense-census-media-use-by-kids-age-zero-to-eight-2017#).

The survey of parents of children 8 and under suggests that tiny tots are spending a lot of time with tiny screens. The survey indicates that 98 percent of homes have a mobile device such as a tablet or smartphone. Average time spent on devices by children 8 & under is up to 48 minutes per day in 2017.

Other interesting findings:
- 42 percent of young children now have their very own tablet device — up from 7 percent four years ago and less than 1 percent in 2011.
- Screen media use among infants under 2 appears to be trending downward, from 58 minutes a day in 2013 to 42 minutes in 2017.
- Nearly half, 49 percent, of children 8 or under "often or sometimes" use screens in the hour before bedtime, which experts say is bad for sleep habits.
- 42 percent of parents say the TV is on "always" or "most of the time" in their home, whether anyone is watching or not. Research has shown this so-called "background TV" reduces parent-child interaction, which in turn can hurt language development.

### [Students learn better from books than screens, according to a new study](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/10/students-learn-better-from-books-than-screens-according-to-a-new-study)

This week I shared out this research report on my socials and immediately kicked up a bunch of controversy among my online friends and colleagues. You can [review the post here on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/wiobyrne/posts/10210331951752027?comment_id=10210345498370684&reply_comment_id=10210348195798118&notif_id=1508378595986042&notif_t=feed_comment) and review the comments.

The piece from Patricia Alexander and Lauren Singer from the University of Maryland shares research that posits that students prefer and experience learning gains in reading from printed, traditional texts as opposed to screens.

I agree with the results from Alexander and Singer, but think that the truth is far murkier. Part of my response is in [the video I linked above](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZ_Px1wBcLY). I think there are ways that we (and our students) should and could be reading on screens. Merely moving print to a screen does not take into account complexities of new tools and practices.

On a side note, I'm looking at different places to publish to reach different audiences. I'm paying attention to how Alexander and Singer published their original research, and then published a version of the findings in [The Conversation](https://theconversation.com/us) and this was in conjunction with the [World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/). Finally...this was picked up by [Business Insider](http://www.businessinsider.com/students-learning-education-print-textbooks-screens-study-2017-10?IR=T). For those of you that regularly write and blog...this is something to pay attention to.

### [13 writing tips, from beloved teacher Anne Lamott](https://ideas.ted.com/14-writing-tips-from-beloved-teacher-anne-lamott/)

[Anne Lamott](https://twitter.com/ANNELAMOTT), the presenter of the TED Talk [12 truths I learned from life and writing](https://www.ted.com/talks/anne_lamott_12_truths_i_learned_from_life_and_writing), shares advice on writing:

- Set your sights small
- Think of your writing as a pond - now go play in it
- There's no shame in hitting the "delete" button
- Your first will stink - and that's OK
- Find a couple of critics you love
- Imagine the book you dream of finding, and then bring it to life
- You'll get so much more out of writing than just a manuscript
- It will probably take some trial and error before you find your voice as a writer
- Don't wait to be "in the mood" to write - unless you want to wait forever
- If all else fails, send Stevo Lamott a letter (pretend to write someone a letter to document your thinking & ideas)
- Waste more time and more paper
- Try to be your own coach
- Think of your writing as a gift to the world

## 🔨 Do

### [CheckMark Extension for providing feedback on Google Docs](http://www.freetech4teachers.com/2017/10/checkmark-extension-for-providing.html#.WesnThNSyHo)

In my classes I require that students complete and submit their work in Google Docs. This allows me to help them build their use of the tools and platform, while allowing me to make assessment more of a discussion as opposed to a one time event.

The challenge with this is that you often find yourself leaving some of the same feedback and comments for multiple students on their work.

The [CheckMark](http://www.checkmarkclass.com/) [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/checkmark/kfddponboekcbjlhhjinkefjollhhidp) allows you save frequent comments in an overlay and quickly click/add while reviewing. The selections show up as comments on the student work. See a [video of it in action here](http://www.checkmarkclass.com/demo.html).

I'll start testing it over the remainder of the semester and report back. I'm interested to see if I can build in multiple saved overlays per assignment. What this means is that I could save elements of a rubric that I'm focusing on in my feedback and only have that appear for certain assignments where it is appropriate.
