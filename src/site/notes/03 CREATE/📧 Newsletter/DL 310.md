# DL 310
## A Concentrated Set of Users

**Published**: November 6, 2021 • [[03 CREATE/📧 Newsletter/📧 Newsletter\|📧 Newsletter]]

Welcome back, friends. Here is *Digitally Literate*, issue #310. Your go-to source for insightful content on education, technology, and the digital landscape.

This week, I contributed to the following:
- **[Infusing Computational Thinking into STEM Teaching: From Professional Development to Classroom Practice](https://www.j-ets.net/collection/published-issues/24_4)** - A publication in the themed issue of *Educational Technology & Society* examining how middle and high school teachers infuse STEM and computational thinking into teaching.

Feel free to reach out at [hello@digitallyliterate.net](mailto:hello@digitallyliterate.net).

## 🔖 Key Takeaways
- **Climate Crisis Urgency**: The 2021 moment represents a critical juncture for limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius as outlined in the Paris Climate Agreement
- **Concentrated Harassment Power**: Small groups of coordinated accounts can drive disproportionate amounts of online harassment, demonstrating how platform algorithms amplify targeted abuse
- **Facebook Papers Contradictions**: Internal documents reveal stark contrasts between Facebook's public statements and private acknowledgments about platform harms
- **Deepfake Democratization**: AI-powered face-swapping technology has become accessible enough for widespread misuse, particularly targeting women with nonconsensual pornography
- **Metaverse Already Exists**: While Facebook promotes its metaverse vision, millions of people are already building and thriving in virtual worlds like Minecraft

### [Climate Action Tracker: The State of the Climate Crisis in 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wJo5aKBwq0)
2021 is a critical year for climate change. The Paris Climate Agreement calls for urgent action to reduce carbon emissions and avoid catastrophic global warming.

The [Climate Action Tracker](https://countdown.ted.com/) shares both the progress and setbacks, shedding light on where we stand in limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.

## 📚 Read

### [Here Are All the Facebook Papers Stories](https://www.protocol.com/facebook-papers)
[The Facebook Papers](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QYqmJsifBjf_xA23Ea7AdeMFyjGWaF_dvhi5EZdNUf4/edit) expose internal documents revealing stark contrasts to public statements by Facebook. Despite the negative press, profits continue to soar.

These documents represent the most comprehensive look yet at Facebook's internal operations and decision-making processes, revealing how the company prioritizes growth and engagement over user safety and societal well-being.

### [Twitter Data Reveals a Coordinated Campaign Against Meghan Markle](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ellievhall/bot-sentinel-meghan-markle-prince-harry-twitter/)
A report by [Bot Sentinel](https://botsentinel.com/) highlights how a small group of Twitter accounts drives 70% of online trolling against Meghan Markle and Prince Harry. This reflects the outsized influence a concentrated group can wield on social media.

The research demonstrates how algorithmic amplification can make small, coordinated harassment campaigns appear like widespread public sentiment, creating false narratives that influence media coverage and public perception.

### [Help Build an Open Source Voice Database](https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/)
Mozilla's initiative aims to create a diverse voice database for AI assistants. Contribute your voice to ensure inclusivity for underrepresented languages and dialects.

This project represents an important alternative to corporate-controlled voice data collection, emphasizing diversity and open access over proprietary control.

### [The Metaverse Is Already Here — It's Minecraft](https://debugger.medium.com/the-metaverse-is-already-here-its-minecraft-99c89ed8ba2)
As Facebook rebrands to Meta, and [Zuckerberg trots out a vision of the metaverse](https://www.vice.com/en/article/88g9vv/zuckerbergs-meta-endgame-is-monetizing-all-human-behavior), [Clive Thompson](https://www.clivethompson.net/) indicates that our kids are already building and playing in the metaverse.

*The truth is, a thriving metaverse already exists. It's incredibly high-functioning, with millions of people immersed in it for hours a day. In this metaverse, people have built uncountable custom worlds, and generated god knows how many profitable businesses and six-figure careers. Yet this terrain looks absolutely nothing like the one Zuckerberg showed off.*

*It's Minecraft, of course.*

Thompson's insight reveals how corporate visions of the metaverse often ignore existing virtual communities that have already solved many of the technical and social challenges of online world-building.

### [A Horrifying New AI App Swaps Women Into Porn Videos With a Click](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021-09-13/1035449/ai-deepfake-app-face-swaps-women-into-porn/)
We knew this day would come.

We've covered deepfakes for some time here in this newsletter. Deepfakes began as users could take the face and voice of someone famous and overlay that onto a pre-existing video. Most of the early deepfakes began as AI-generated synthetic media was used to create pornographic representations of real people.

According to deepfake researcher [Henry Ajder](https://twitter.com/henryajder), a new web app lets anyone upload a photo of a person and, using deepfake technology, superimpose their face into an adult video.

So far, the app exists in "relative obscurity," and the MIT Tech Review post above refers to the platform only as "Y," in an attempt to avoid inadvertently launching it into the mainstream.

This development represents the democratization of harmful synthetic media creation, making sophisticated image manipulation accessible to anyone with basic computer skills.

## 🔨 Do

### Intentionally Cultivate Self-Compassion
Practicing self-compassion can provide a safe space to process vulnerability and build resilience. Explore guided meditations to strengthen your self-kindness.

[Self-compassion exercises and guided meditations](https://self-compassion.org/category/exercises/#guided-meditations) offer evidence-based approaches to developing emotional resilience and reducing self-criticism.

## 🤔 Consider

### Almost everything will work again if you unplug it for a few minutes, including you.
*Anne Lamott*

---

This wisdom perfectly captures the themes explored throughout this issue. The Facebook Papers reveal a company that never unplugs—constantly optimizing for engagement regardless of social consequences. The coordinated harassment campaigns against public figures demonstrate what happens when toxic actors never pause their activities. Climate change represents the ultimate failure to unplug from destructive systems.

Lamott's insight reminds us that in our hyperconnected age, the simple act of disconnection—from algorithms, from outrage cycles, from constant productivity demands—can be restorative and clarifying. Just as we might reboot a malfunctioning device, stepping back from digital overwhelm allows us to return with renewed perspective and intentionality.

The contrast between Facebook's corporate metaverse vision and the organic creativity of Minecraft communities shows what's possible when people have space to explore without being optimized for profit.

### Newsletter Evolution Note
Issue #310 demonstrates Ian's ability to weave together urgent global challenges (climate crisis), platform governance failures (Facebook Papers), targeted harassment dynamics (Meghan Markle campaign), technological ethics (deepfakes), and practical wisdom (self-compassion). This synthesis reflects his growing sophistication in connecting individual experiences with systemic patterns while maintaining both analytical rigor and emotional intelligence. The "concentrated set of users" title cleverly captures both the harassment research findings and the broader theme of how small groups can wield disproportionate influence in digital systems.
