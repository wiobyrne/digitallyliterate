** Too Long; Didn't Read (TL;DR) newsletter #101

------------------------------------------------------------

Well, we're up over the century mark. Welcome to issue #101 of TL;DR. :)

Feel free to share with someone that you believe would benefit. Subscribe (http://wiobyrne.us11.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=7b5ee323a16720dad25ff96ff&id=17e92a2ae1)  to this newsletter if you stumbled across this newsletter online.

This week's issue is all about the ties that bind us.

This week I shared:

* Three things I've learned by writing a newsletter (http://wiobyrne.com/writing-a-newsletter/) - This post is primarily a reflection of things I've learned about the process of writing this newsletter. I think it's helpful for those of you that have already started a newsletter, and you're looking for reasons to keep going.

* Prompts & Reflections from #TXEDUCHAT (http://wiobyrne.com/txeduchat-6-4-2017/) - This past week I hosted the #TXEDUCHAT. The focus of this chat was on becoming a digitally agile educator. This is a very important topic for me that frames much of my work.

* What is missing from the Mozilla Web Literacy Standards (http://wiobyrne.com/what-is-missing-from-web-literacy-standards/) - With the discussions about the Mozilla Network 50 selection (and some other recent events), I've been looking at opportunities to dive back into the web literacy work. This post outlines where I think this work should head...and my potential interests for these next steps.

Please get in touch with me at hello@wiobyrne.com. You can review archives of the newsletter here (http://us11.campaign-archive1.com/home/?u=7b5ee323a16720dad25ff96ff&id=17e92a2ae1)  or on Medium (https://medium.com/tldr-newsletter) . I also share the quotes at the bottom of the newsletter on Instagram (https://www.instagram.com/wiobyrne/) .

## 📺 Watch

** The Rise of the Machines - Why automation is different this time (11:40) (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSKi8HfcxEk)

This is another great video from the ** Kurzgesagt - In a nutshell YouTube channel (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsXVk37bltHxD1rDPwtNM8Q)

. I love their work, and this video is very timely as it effectively discusses the role of automation in the future of jobs...and what makes it different at this point in time.

This is important as we consider what the future might look like.

## 📚 Read

This piece in the ** NY Times (http://www.nytimes.com/)

by ** Natasha Singer (https://twitter.com/natashanyt)

documents some of the big philanthropic money being spent by Silicon Valley executives.

The piece cautions the fact that these efforts are happening so quickly, there is often little to no scrutiny about how this money is being spent. The main concern is about the democratizing process (or lack thereof) that is occurring behind the scenes with this work.

** How the Trump-Russia data machine games Google to fool Americans (https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2017/06/how-the-trump-russia-data-machine-games-google-to.html)

This piece from ** Roger Sollenberger (https://twitter.com/rlongennamer)

in ** Paste Magazine (https://www.pastemagazine.com/)

talks about the money and lack of transparency that is affecting the information that you read online.

We've talked quite a bit over the past couple of months about the challenges that exist as we use the Internet to read, write, and socialize. We need to negotiate misinformation, bots, and paid advertising that is directly trying to misinform. What makes this worse is that these attacks are all custom tailored by the social and personal information corporations like Google have collected about us.

This calls for greater reliance on critical media literacy and emotional intelligence in our educational systems.

** Theresa May wants to ban crypto: Here's what that would cost, and here's why it won't work anyway (https://boingboing.net/2017/06/04/theresa-may-king-canute.html)

This week another series of terror attacks struck the citizens of London. As we often see after terror attacks like this, politicians often use this as an opportunity to indicate a need to weaken or ban encryption.

In this post from ** Cory Doctorow (https://twitter.com/doctorow)

in ** Boing Boing (https://boingboing.net/)

you can review a thorough explanation of how and why weakening/banning encryption is a horrible idea.

We've discussed encryption quite a bit in TL;DR over the past couple of months. This is a topic that is definitely hard to understand. But, it is our duty to understand how these digital tools operate if we choose to use them. As indicated by Doctorow, "Aaron Swartz once said, "It's no longer OK not to understand how the Internet works."

** The Kids are Alt-Right (https://www.buzzfeed.com/albertsamaha/kids-are-quoting-trump-to-bully-their-classmates?utm_term=.ifk8888bg7#.ub8zzzz1VB)

This past October, I was sitting in a 6th grade classroom preparing to observe one of my students teach a class. As the class began, the students were watching a quick newscast about the debate for the U.S. Presidential Election the night before. In this debate, some of the dialogue from the politicians made me cringe as I sat in the back of the room. I looked around the room and wondered what effect this dialogue would have on these children.

This post from ** BuzzFeed (https://www.buzzfeed.com/)

shares some insight into recent acts of hate speech, vandalism in U.S. schools following the U.S. Presidential election.

This is a tough topic for me to make sense of. On one hand, I'm very sensitive to the role of language in our classrooms. I also pay attention to the role of culture and protecting all individuals in any learning situation. That being said, I think students in our classrooms need opportunities to learn and make mistakes without missteps, or "stupid things" showing up on the front page of the newspaper.

I'm definitely paying attention. What do you think?

** The thoughts of a spiderweb (https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-thoughts-of-a-spiderweb-20170523/)

This post by ** Josh Sokol (https://twitter.com/josh_sokol)

in ** Quanta Magazine (https://www.quantamagazine.org/)

is the perfect cleanse for your brain after reading too much about politics, technology, or education. This piece from Sokol examines some of the ways in which different organisms may store cognitive information in the physical world.

It's a fascinating read that you should take some time and consume.

## 🔨 Do

Google launched an educational program designed to teach kids about phishing, Internet harassment, passwords, and other Internet safety issues.

Called “** Be Internet Awesome (https://blog.google/topics/families/be-internet-awesome-helping-kids-make-smart-decisions-online/)

,” it includes a classroom curriculum and a video game called ** Interland (https://beinternetawesome.withgoogle.com/interland)

. It was developed with help from teachers, YouTube videographers, and internet safety and literacy organizations, and resources are available online for free.

You can learn more from Richard Byrne's ** post on the topic (http://www.freetech4teachers.com/2017/06/be-internet-awesome-googles-new.html)

.

Take some time to play along and learn a ton.

## 🤔 Consider

We cannot live for ourselves alone. Our lives are connected by a thousand invisible threads, and along these sympathetic fibers, our actions run as causes and return to us as results.
