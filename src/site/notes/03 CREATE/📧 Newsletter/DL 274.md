Digitally Literate #274 (January 16, 2021)

WELCOME

The Internet is a Crime Scene

Welcome back friends. I hope you...and those around you...are safe.

This week I worked on the following:

* Accessible and Approachable (https://wiobyrne.com/accessible-and-approachable/) - We must make intellectual work accessible, and accessible work intellectual.

* Monkeys Throwing Feces (https://wiobyrne.com/monkeys-throwing-feces/) - Some insight as my partner decides to leave social media for the foreseeable future.

* Fit Versus Fit (https://wiobyrne.com/fit-versus-fit/) - When we look for a job, there are usually two questions that many jobs will ask. Are you the right fit and are you the right fit?

If you haven't already, please subscribe (https://digitallyliterate.net/subscribe/) if you would like this newsletter to show up in your inbox. Feel free to reach out and say hey at hello@digitallyliterate.net (mailto:hello@digitallyliterate.net) .

** They Used to Post Selfies. Now They’re Trying to Reverse the Election (https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/14/opinion/facebook-far-right.html)

------------------------------------------------------------

The Capitol siege was the biggest media spectacle of the Trump era (https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jan/11/the-capitol-siege-was-the-biggest-media-spectacle-of-the-trump-era) . It will be interesting to see this leads to any change in our relationship to misinfromation (https://www.wired.com/story/opinion-the-dc-riot-is-the-sandy-hook-of-the-disinformation-crisis/) .

Thsi will most likely lead to no changes as right-wing influencers who embraced extremist views have been rewarded by Facebool algorithms. Facebook adds fuel to the fire as the social network shows ads for military gear next to posts for the insurrection (https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/facebook-profits-military-gear-ads-capitol-riot) .

We need to ask questions about the use of the algorithmic internet, which acts as an accelerant for white supremacy (https://points.datasociety.net/how-tech-media-enabled-a-white-supremacist-coup-84fb75af5850) .

** Every Deleted Parler Post, Many With Users' Location Data, Has Been Archived (https://gizmodo.com/every-deleted-parler-post-many-with-users-location-dat-1846032466)

------------------------------------------------------------

In the wake of the violent insurrection at the U.S. Capitol by scores of President Trump’s supporters, a lone researcher began an effort (https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7vqew/the-hacker-who-archived-parler-explains-how-she-did-it-and-what-comes-next) to catalog the posts of social media users across Parler (https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/11/24/21579357/parler-app-trump-twitter-facebook-censorship) , a platform founded to provide conservative users a safe haven for uninhibited “free speech” (https://www.wired.com/story/parler-bans-new-chapter-free-speech-wars/) — but which ultimately devolved into a hotbed of far-right conspiracy theories, unchecked racism, and death threats aimed at prominent politicians.

The quick thinking of a self-described hacker by the name of donk_enby and a host of amateur data hoarders (https://thenewstack.io/how-parlers-data-was-harvested/) preserved more than 56.7 terabytes of data from Parler. This data included GPS metadata and videos from Parler and has been used to create an interactive map of this content (https://thepatr10t.github.io/yall-Qaeda/) .

** Facial Recognition Technology Isn’t Good Just Because It’s Used to Arrest Neo-Nazis (https://slate.com/technology/2021/01/facial-recognition-technology-capitol-siege.html)

------------------------------------------------------------

Great post from Joan Donovan (https://twitter.com/BostonJoan) and Chris Gilliard (https://twitter.com/hypervisible) on the risk and reward in our use of surveillance tech.

Crisis is often used to increase the reach of surveillance technologies. Many who consider the use of facial recognition technology ethically wrong in the context of policing take a different stance when it’s in the hands of researchers and journalists trying to identify neo-Nazis and insurrectionists. This could end up further entrenching facial recognition technology at a time when we should be working to ban it.

** Teach Your White Kids About Their Privelege (https://offspring.lifehacker.com/teach-your-white-kids-about-their-privilege-1846050995)

------------------------------------------------------------

Systemic racism is still a daily reality, white supremacists are feeling increasingly emboldened, and white people are inherently privileged. White parents need to talk with their white children about their privilege.

While we're on the topic, this post by Dr. Laura M. Jimenez (https://booktoss.org/2021/01/08/dear-liberal-white-teachers/) shares actionable advice on how to interupt whiteness in the classroom.
