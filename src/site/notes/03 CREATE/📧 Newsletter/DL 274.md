Hi all, welcome back friends. I hope you—and those around you—are safe.

This week I worked on the following:

- [Accessible and Approachable](https://wiobyrne.com/accessible-and-approachable/) - We must make intellectual work accessible, and accessible work intellectual.
- [Monkeys Throwing Feces](https://wiobyrne.com/monkeys-throwing-feces/) - Some insight as my partner decides to leave social media for the foreseeable future.
- [Fit Versus Fit](https://wiobyrne.com/fit-versus-fit/) - When we look for a job, there are usually two questions: Are you the right fit and are you the right fit?

### [They Used to Post Selfies. Now They're Trying to Reverse the Election](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/14/opinion/facebook-far-right.html)

[The Capitol siege was the biggest media spectacle of the Trump era](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jan/11/the-capitol-siege-was-the-biggest-media-spectacle-of-the-trump-era). It will be interesting to see if this leads to any [change in our relationship to misinformation](https://www.wired.com/story/opinion-the-dc-riot-is-the-sandy-hook-of-the-disinformation-crisis/).

This will most likely lead to no changes as right-wing influencers who embraced extremist views have been rewarded by Facebook algorithms. Facebook adds fuel to the fire as the social network [shows ads for military gear next to posts for the insurrection](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/facebook-profits-military-gear-ads-capitol-riot).

We need to ask questions about the use of the [algorithmic internet, which acts as an accelerant for white supremacy](https://points.datasociety.net/how-tech-media-enabled-a-white-supremacist-coup-84fb75af5850).

### [Every Deleted Parler Post Has Been Archived](https://gizmodo.com/every-deleted-parler-post-many-with-users-location-dat-1846032466)

In the wake of the violent insurrection, a [lone researcher began an effort](https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7vqew/the-hacker-who-archived-parler-explains-how-she-did-it-and-what-comes-next) to catalog Parler posts.

The quick thinking of a self-described hacker by the name of donk_enby and [amateur data hoarders](https://thenewstack.io/how-parlers-data-was-harvested/) preserved more than 56.7 terabytes of data from Parler. This data included GPS metadata and has been used to create an [interactive map of this content](https://thepatr10t.github.io/yall-Qaeda/).

### [Facial Recognition Technology Isn't Good Just Because It's Used to Arrest Neo-Nazis](https://slate.com/technology/2021/01/facial-recognition-technology-capitol-siege.html)

Great post from [Joan Donovan](https://twitter.com/BostonJoan) and [Chris Gilliard](https://twitter.com/hypervisible) on risk and reward in surveillance tech.

Crisis is often used to increase the reach of surveillance technologies. Many who consider facial recognition ethically wrong in policing take a different stance when it's used to identify neo-Nazis. This could end up further entrenching facial recognition at a time when we should be working to ban it.

### [Teach Your White Kids About Their Privilege](https://offspring.lifehacker.com/teach-your-white-kids-about-their-privilege-1846050995)

Systemic racism is still a daily reality, white supremacists are feeling increasingly emboldened, and white people are inherently privileged. White parents need to talk with their white children about their privilege.

While we're on the topic, this post by [Dr. Laura M. Jimenez](https://booktoss.org/2021/01/08/dear-liberal-white-teachers/) shares actionable advice on how to interrupt whiteness in the classroom.

## 🤔 Consider

### The illegal we do immediately. The unconstitutional takes a little longer.

*Henry Kissinger*

Kissinger's dark humor frames an issue about boundaries—legal, ethical, constitutional. The internet became a crime scene, archived by hackers before it went dark. Facial recognition identifies insurrectionists but normalizes surveillance. The algorithms are legal. The coups they accelerate take a little longer.
