### [They Used to Post Selfies. Now They're Trying to Reverse the Election](https://www.nytimes.com/2021-01-14/opinion/facebook-far-right.html)

The Capitol siege was the [biggest media spectacle of the Trump era](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jan/11/the-capitol-siege-was-the-biggest-media-spectacle-of-the-trump-era). It will be interesting to see if this [leads to any change in our relationship to misinformation](https://www.wired.com/story/opinion-the-dc-riot-is-the-sandy-hook-of-the-disinformation-crisis/). 

This will most likely lead to no changes as right-wing influencers who embraced extremist views have been rewarded by Facebook algorithms. Facebook adds fuel to the fire as the social network shows [ads for military gear next to posts for the insurrection](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/facebook-profits-military-gear-ads-capitol-riot). 

We need to ask questions about the use of the [algorithmic internet, which acts as an accelerant for white supremacy](https://points.datasociety.net/how-tech-media-enabled-a-white-supremacist-coup-84fb75af5850).

### [Every Deleted Parler Post, Many With Users' Location Data, Has Been Archived](https://gizmodo.com/every-deleted-parler-post-many-with-users-location-dat-1846032466)

In the wake of the violent insurrection at the U.S. Capitol by scores of President Trump's supporters, [a lone researcher began an effort](https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7vqew/the-hacker-who-archived-parler-explains-how-she-did-it-and-what-comes-next) to catalog the posts of social media users across [Parler](https://www.vox.com/recode/2020-11-24/21579357/parler-app-trump-twitter-facebook-censorship), a platform founded to provide conservative users [a safe haven for uninhibited "free speech(https://www.wired.com/story/parler-bans-new-chapter-free-speech-wars/) — but which ultimately devolved into a hotbed of far-right conspiracy theories, unchecked racism, and death threats aimed at prominent politicians.

The quick thinking of a self-described hacker by the name of [donk_enby and a host of amateur data hoarders](https://thenewstack.io/how-parlers-data-was-harvested/) preserved more than 56.7 terabytes of data from Parler. This data included GPS metadata and videos from Parler and has been used to create [an interactive map of this content](https://thepatr10t.github.io/yall-Qaeda/). 

### [Facial Recognition Technology Isn't Good Just Because It's Used to Arrest Neo-Nazis](https://slate.com/technology/2021/01/facial-recognition-technology-capitol-siege.html)

Great post from [Joan Donovan](https://twitter.com/BostonJoan) and [Chris Gilliard](https://twitter.com/hypervisible) on the risk and reward in our use of surveillance tech.

*Crisis is often used to increase the reach of surveillance technologies. Many who consider the use of facial recognition technology ethically wrong in the context of policing take a different stance when it's in the hands of researchers and journalists trying to identify neo-Nazis and insurrectionists. This could end up further entrenching facial recognition technology at a time when we should be working to ban it.*

### [Teach Your White Kids About Their Privilege](https://offspring.lifehacker.com/teach-your-white-kids-about-their-privilege-1846050995)

Systemic racism is still a daily reality, white supremacists are feeling increasingly emboldened, and white people are inherently privileged. White parents need to talk with their white children about their privilege. 

While we're on the topic, [this post by Dr. Laura M. Jimenez](https://booktoss.org/2021-01-08/dear-liberal-white-teachers/) shares actionable advice on how to interrupt whiteness in the classroom.
