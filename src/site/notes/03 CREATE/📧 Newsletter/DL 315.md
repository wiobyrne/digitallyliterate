## Weaving the Memory Puzzle Into a Tapestry

This will be my last post for 2021. I'll take the remainder of the month off to tinker with my website, newsletter, and social media feeds. Some exciting updates are on the way!  

---

## üîñ Key Takeaways

- **Critical Learning**: Rethinking how books and digital tools can enhance memory and understanding.  
- **Tech Regulation**: Addressing gaps in tech governance and the consequences of ineffective oversight.  
- **AI and Equity**: Building community-rooted AI research free from Big Tech's influence.

## üìö This Week‚Äôs Highlights

### 1. **[Springboard: The Secret History of the First Real Smartphone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9_Vh9h3Ohw)**  
A decade before the iPhone, Handspring‚Äôs Treo attempted to shape the future of smartphones.  
**Why this matters**: Innovation often comes from those who challenge norms before the world is ready.

### 2. **[Why Books Don‚Äôt Work](https://andymatuschak.org/books/)**  
I'm spending a lot of time iterating my information consumption habits. As part of this exploration, I've come across the writings of [Andy Matuschak](https://andymatuschak.org/).

This post details the reasons why Matuschak believes that books, textbooks, and lectures...traditional vessels for information...in our lives do not work.

In the post linked above, Andy asks the question, How might we design mediums which do the job of a non-fiction book‚Äîbut which actually work reliably?

To show proof of concept, Matuschak worked with [Michael Nielsen](http://michaelnielsen.org) on [_Quantum Country_](https://quantum.country/qcvc), a ‚Äúbook‚Äù on quantum computation. Please be advised, reading this ‚Äúbook‚Äù doesn‚Äôt look like reading any other book. The explanatory text is tightly woven with brief interactive review sessions, as the authors help weave the memory puzzle into a larger tapestry.

I recognize that many readers of this newsletter, and my work will be equally infuriated and intrigued by the points made in this post. This is one of the main problems I'll explore during my digital hiatus.

**Why this matters**: Designing new mediums for learning could transform how we consume and retain knowledge.

### 3. **[Congress and Tech Regulation: A Missed Opportunity](https://www.nytimes.com/2021-12-11/business/congress-tech-regulation.html)**  
Years of questioning tech CEOs in Congress have yielded little actionable policy. Meanwhile, other nations enact laws with real impact.  
**Why this matters**: Policy inertia risks public trust and accountability in the digital age.

### 4. **[A Body of Work That Cannot Be Ignored](https://logicmag.io/beacons/a-body-of-work-that-cannot-be-ignored/)**  
It's been a year since [Timnit Gebru](https://twitter.com/timnitGebru) was fired from Google after warning the search giant that [messy artificial intelligence can lead to the silencing of marginalized voices](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/dec/06/google-silicon-valley-ai-timnit-gebru).

In this post, [J. Khadijah Abdurahman](https://twitter.com/UpFromTheCracks) on how technology produces ‚Äúnew modes of state surveillance and control‚Äù and what we might do about it.

_Racial capitalism‚Äôs roadmap for innovation is predicated on profound extraction. AI is central to this process. The next flashpoint over AI is inevitable‚Äîbut our failure to respond adequately is not. Will we continue to write letters appealing to the conscience of corporations or the state? Or will we build a mass movement?_

This week, Gebru also started the [Distributed AI Research Institute (DAIR)](https://www.dair-institute.org/). This is a space for independent, community-rooted AI research free from Big Tech‚Äôs pervasive influence.
**Why this matters**: Independent AI research is critical for fostering equity and transparency.

### 5. **[Twitter‚Äôs New Privacy Policy and Its Complex Implications](https://www.cjr.org/the_media_today/twitters-new-privacy-policy-could-clash-with-journalism.php)**  
This week, Twitter [said it is expanding its privacy policy to include what the company calls ‚Äúprivate media.‚Äù](https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/private-information-policy-update) The current privacy policy prevents users of the service from sharing other people‚Äôs private information, such as phone numbers, addresses, and other personal details that [might make someone identifiable](https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/personal-information) against their will. Under this policy, users who have shared such data have had their accounts blocked or restricted in a variety of ways.

The new addition to the policy forbids ‚Äúthe misuse of media‚Ä¶ that is not available elsewhere online as a tool to harass, intimidate, and reveal the identities of individuals.‚Äù [Twitter said it is concerned because personal imagery](https://twitter.com/TwitterSafety/status/1465738076978774018?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1465738076978774018%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnn.com%2F2021%2F12%2F01%2Ftech%2Ftwitter-remove-private-images-intl-scli%2Findex.html) can violate privacy and lead to emotional or physical harm, and this can ‚Äúhave a disproportionate effect on women, activists, dissidents, and members of minority communities.‚Äù

Neo-Nazis and far-right activists are making the most of the [new Twitter rule](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021-12-01/twitter-photo-policy/?itid=lk_inline_manual_2) and [managing to remove photos of them](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021-12-02/twitter-media-rule-used-by-extremists/) posted by journalists. Twitter is currently [re](https://email.mg2.substack.com/c/eJwlkc2OhSAMhZ_mstMIouKCxWzmNQw_VckoOFivYZ5-4JqQc0JL0_bDKIQlxCSPcCIpMmE6QHq4zw0QIZLrhDg5K7mgIyXZLRWdIO6c5giwK7dJjBeQ49KbMwpd8OU54z0nqzR8tEOvDOfAtR2AKd121nTQWEoHY56e6rIOvAEJb4gpeCCbXBGP89V-vdh3Pvd917jCcqlonfK1CXuOIpjVhy0sKV9Yw2g2CyZrI0r6dmWFKm9THdG9lUnVEfKUqZpVrKJbViROlkLKaFbGmrZmtZ7Hse16YfigRavnWujd__79xBdv9oXV56VPVOanTEGivF3QKXrI2aXw-IQzjin7fnmHaQKv9Ab2IYUP7Q-7aQEPMf-CnRRK2rcjHWjLetqPD5pCvmvaXrCR5L425CovbTDXDh7VtqV_YSmacg)[v](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/dec/08/twitter-new-privacy-policy-far-right)[iewing the policy](https://email.mg2.substack.com/c/eJwlkc2OhSAMhZ_mstMIouKCxWzmNQw_VckoOFivYZ5-4JqQc0JL0_bDKIQlxCSPcCIpMmE6QHq4zw0QIZLrhDg5K7mgIyXZLRWdIO6c5giwK7dJjBeQ49KbMwpd8OU54z0nqzR8tEOvDOfAtR2AKd121nTQWEoHY56e6rIOvAEJb4gpeCCbXBGP89V-vdh3Pvd917jCcqlonfK1CXuOIpjVhy0sKV9Yw2g2CyZrI0r6dmWFKm9THdG9lUnVEfKUqZpVrKJbViROlkLKaFbGmrZmtZ7Hse16YfigRavnWujd__79xBdv9oXV56VPVOanTEGivF3QKXrI2aXw-IQzjin7fnmHaQKv9Ab2IYUP7Q-7aQEPMf-CnRRK2rcjHWjLetqPD5pCvmvaXrCR5L425CovbTDXDh7VtqV_YSmacg).

**Why this matters**: Striking the balance between privacy and transparency is increasingly challenging.

### 6. **[In Texas, a Battle Over Education and Books](https://www.nytimes.com/2021-12-10/us/texas-critical-race-theory-ban-books.html)**  
Curriculum debates and book bans in Texas highlight the broader cultural and political struggles over education.  

_Texas is afire with fierce battles over education, race, and gender. What began as a debate over social studies curriculum and critical race studies ‚Äî an academic theory about how systemic racism enters the pores of society ‚Äî has become something broader and more profound, not least an effort to curtail and even ban books, including classics of American literature._

_What are schools and teachers to make of these crosscurrents?_
**Why this matters**: Educators face growing challenges in fostering inclusive and critical thinking environments.

[The Father of Web3 Wants You to Trust Less](https://www.wired.com/story/web3-gavin-wood-interview/). [Gavin Wood](https://gavwood.com/), who coined the term Web3 in 2014, believes decentralized technologies are the only hope of preserving liberal democracy.

_At the most basic level, Web3 refers to a decentralized online ecosystem based on the blockchain. Platforms and apps built on Web3 won‚Äôt be owned by a central gatekeeper, but rather by users, who will earn their ownership stake by helping to develop and maintain those services._
