## Ecological Harmonization of Humans With Everything Non-Human

Welcome back, friends! Here's _Digitally Literate_, issue #303.  

This week was wild and bumpy, but I‚Äôm glad to reconnect and share insights.

## üîñ Key Takeaways  

- **Inclusive Learning**: Universal Design for Learning (UDL) provides a framework for accessible and engaging teaching strategies.  
- **Digital Equity**: Addressing disparities in tech access and harassment faced by educators and students.  
- **Equity in Hiring**: Automated hiring systems need rethinking to uncover hidden talent pools.

## üìö This Week‚Äôs Highlights  

### 1. **[Universal Design for Learning (UDL)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NL2xPwDrGqQ)**  
In this video, [John Spencer](https://spencerauthor.com/) explains UDL with practical strategies for inclusive teaching.  
**Why this matters:** UDL ensures that learning environments are accessible and flexible to meet diverse needs.

### 2. **[KFF COVID-19 Vaccine Monitor](https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/dashboard/kff-covid-19-vaccine-monitor-dashboard/)**  
Long-time reader and friend [Bryan Alexander](https://bryanalexander.org/) shared this resource from the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF). It is interesting to unpack the public‚Äôs attitudes and experiences with COVID-19 vaccinations.

The unvaccinated tend to be [younger, less educated, Republicans.](https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/poll-finding/kff-covid-19-vaccine-monitor-july-2021).

When we think about [parents in the pandemic](https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/poll-finding/kff-covid-19-vaccine-monitor-parents-and-the-pandemic/), the results are even more interesting. Four In Ten Parents Of Children Ages 12 To 17 Say Their Child Has Received At Least One Dose Of The COVID-19 Vaccine. Four In Ten Parents Of Children Under 12 Say They Want To "Wait And See" Before Getting Their Child Vaccinated.
**Why this matters:** Insights into vaccination trends can inform equitable public health strategies.

### 3. **[Brazil‚Äôs Restrictive New Social Media Rules](https://time.com/6096704/brazil-social-media-rules/)**  
Brazil‚Äôs new [rules](https://www.in.gov.br/en/web/dou/-/medida-provisoria-n-1.068-de-6-de-setembro-de-2021-343277275) appear to be the first in the world to make certain types of content takedowns illegal under national law, even as other national governments around the world implement rules that force social media companies to take down more types of content proactively.

‚ÄúSuch an approach would essentially be a political decision to move in the direction of an Internet with even more vitriol and toxicity which, of course, is often directed primarily against women, minorities, and people with political views that sway from the mainstream.‚Äù - [Rasmus Kleis Nielsen](https://rasmuskleisnielsen.net/), director of the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism at Oxford University.
**Why this matters:** This approach could exacerbate harassment and misinformation globally.

### 4. **[How to Deal With the Dark Side of Social Media](https://www.chronicle.com/article/how-to-deal-with-the-dark-side-of-social-media)**  
Michael B√©rub√© on comprehensive guides to defending faculty and staff members and students from trolls and outrage addicts online. I was sent this post by [Verena Roberts](https://twitter.com/verenanz).

B√©rub√© references the [Faculty Support Safety Guidance](https://provost.uiowa.edu/sites/provost.uiowa.edu/files/2021-07/Faculty_Support_Guidance.pdf) from the University of Iowa and the [Social Media Support and Resources](https://sites.psu.edu/academicaffairs/files/2020/09/Social-Media-Support-and-Resources-for-Penn-State-Faculty_09-17-20.pdf) from Penn State.

This is something that absolutely every single person in academia (especially administrators) should read. Every single campus should develop one if they do not have one.
**Why this matters:** Universities must develop policies to protect faculty and students from online harassment.

### 5. **[Automated Hiring Software Rejects Millions of Candidates](https://www.theverge.com/2021-09-06/22659225/automated-hiring-software-rejecting-viable-candidates-harvard-business-school)**  
A [Harvard Business School report](https://www.hbs.edu/managing-the-future-of-work/Documents/research/hiddenworkers09032021.pdf) reveals how rigid hiring algorithms overlook qualified candidates.  
**Why this matters:** Organizations must rethink hiring practices to uncover hidden talent.

### 6. **[How to Build a Bigger Following on Twitch](https://lifehacker.com/how-to-build-a-bigger-following-on-twitch-1847434468)**  
[Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/), is a video live streaming service that focuses on video game live streaming, including broadcasts of esports competitions. In addition, it offers music broadcasts, creative content, and more recently, "in real life" streams.

Building an audience is more of a content game than a numbers one. Focus on the former, and the latter will come.

- Don‚Äôt fixate on numbers, but do focus on content
- Participate on the platform with others
- Collaborate with other streamers outside your lane
- Be as consistent as you can
- Know how to promote yourself elsewhere, especially in advance of streaming

**Why this matters:** Building authentic connections drives meaningful engagement.

[The smartest person in any room anywhere‚Äô: in defence of Elon Musk, by Douglas Coupland](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/aug/29/the-smartest-person-in-any-room-anywhere-in-defence-of-elon-musk-by-douglas-coupland).

This post made the rounds in my circles online. I really like the closing statement:

_I think the biggest difference between the 20th century and the 21st is that in the 20th century you were able to see ‚Äúthe future‚Äù in your head. There were new ways of envisioning, say, an information utopia ‚Äì or an ecological harmonisation of humans with everything non-human. But here in the 21st century we‚Äôre only able to possibly glimpse a small workable future, and even then only if we work at it incredibly hard. That‚Äôs a huge difference in looking at what lies down the road._
