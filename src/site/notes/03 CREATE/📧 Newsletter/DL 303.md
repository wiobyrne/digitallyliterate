# DL 303
## Ecological Harmonization of Humans With Everything Non-Human

**Published**: September 11, 2021 â€¢ [[03 CREATE/ðŸ“§ Newsletter/ðŸ“§ Newsletter\|ðŸ“§ Newsletter]]

Welcome back, friends! Here's *Digitally Literate*, issue #303. Your go-to source for insightful content on education, technology, and the digital landscape.

This week was wild and bumpy, but I'm glad to reconnect and share insights.

## ðŸ”– Key Takeaways
- **Universal Design for Learning**: UDL framework provides accessible and engaging teaching strategies for diverse learners
- **Vaccination Demographics**: COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy correlates with age, education, and political affiliation patterns
- **Brazil's Social Media Experiment**: World's first laws making content takedowns illegal could increase online toxicity globally
- **Academic Harassment Crisis**: Universities urgently need comprehensive policies protecting faculty and students from online attacks
- **Automated Hiring Discrimination**: Rigid algorithms systematically exclude qualified candidates, particularly impacting marginalized communities

### [Universal Design for Learning (UDL)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NL2xPwDrGqQ)
[John Spencer](https://spencerauthor.com/) explains UDL principles with practical classroom strategies. Universal Design for Learning ensures educational environments remain accessible and flexible, accommodating diverse learning needs through multiple means of representation, engagement, and expression.

UDL transforms traditional one-size-fits-all approaches into inclusive frameworks that benefit all learners while specifically supporting students with disabilities, different learning styles, and varied cultural backgrounds.

### [KFF COVID-19 Vaccine Monitor](https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/dashboard/kff-covid-19-vaccine-monitor-dashboard/)
Long-time reader and friend [Bryan Alexander](https://bryanalexander.org/) shared this Kaiser Family Foundation resource tracking public attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccinations. The data reveals fascinating demographic patterns:

The unvaccinated population tends to be [younger, less educated, Republican](https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/poll-finding/kff-covid-19-vaccine-monitor-july-2021/).

When examining [parents during the pandemic](https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/poll-finding/kff-covid-19-vaccine-monitor-parents-and-the-pandemic/), results become more complex:
- Four in ten parents of children ages 12-17 report their child received at least one vaccine dose
- Four in ten parents of children under 12 prefer to "wait and see" before vaccinating their child

These insights inform equitable public health strategies and communication approaches.

### [Brazil's Restrictive New Social Media Rules](https://time.com/6096704/brazil-social-media-rules/)
Brazil enacted unprecedented [legislation](https://www.in.gov.br/en/web/dou/-/medida-provisoria-n-1.068-de-6-de-setembro-de-2021-343277275) making certain content takedowns illegal under national lawâ€”the world's first such approach. While other governments implement rules forcing platforms to remove more content proactively, Brazil moves in the opposite direction.

[Rasmus Kleis Nielsen](https://rasmuskleisnielsen.net/), director of the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism at Oxford University, warns:

*"Such an approach would essentially be a political decision to move in the direction of an Internet with even more vitriol and toxicity which, of course, is often directed primarily against women, minorities, and people with political views that sway from the mainstream."*

This experiment could establish dangerous precedents for global internet governance and platform accountability.

### [How to Deal With the Dark Side of Social Media](https://www.chronicle.com/article/how-to-deal-with-the-dark-side-of-social-media)
Michael BÃ©rubÃ© provides comprehensive guidance for defending faculty, staff, and students from online trolls and harassment. [Verena Roberts](https://twitter.com/verenanz) recommended this crucial resource addressing academic vulnerability in digital spaces.

BÃ©rubÃ© references essential institutional resources:
- [Faculty Support Safety Guidance](https://provost.uiowa.edu/sites/provost.uiowa.edu/files/2021-07/Faculty_Support_Guidance.pdf) from the University of Iowa
- [Social Media Support and Resources](https://sites.psu.edu/academicaffairs/files/2020/09/Social-Media-Support-and-Resources-for-Penn-State-Faculty_09-17-20.pdf) from Penn State

Every academic institution should develop comprehensive policies protecting community members from online harassmentâ€”especially administrators who must understand and address these challenges systematically.

### [Automated Hiring Software Rejects Millions of Candidates](https://www.theverge.com/2021-09-06/22659225/automated-hiring-software-rejecting-viable-candidates-harvard-business-school)
A [Harvard Business School report](https://www.hbs.edu/managing-the-future-of-work/Documents/research/hiddenworkers09032021.pdf) reveals how rigid hiring algorithms systematically exclude qualified candidates. These automated systems often reject applicants for minor resume gaps, non-traditional career paths, or formatting issues that human reviewers would easily understand.

The research demonstrates how algorithmic bias perpetuates employment discrimination, particularly affecting career changers, military veterans, parents returning to work, and other "hidden workers" with valuable but non-linear experiences.

Organizations must rethink hiring practices to uncover human talent that algorithms miss.

### [How to Build a Bigger Following on Twitch](https://lifehacker.com/how-to-build-a-bigger-following-on-twitch-1847434468)
[Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/) serves as a video live streaming platform focusing on gaming, esports competitions, music broadcasts, creative content, and "in real life" streams.

Building authentic audience engagement requires content focus rather than numbers obsession:

- **Prioritize content quality** over metrics
- **Participate actively** with other creators and communities
- **Collaborate across genres** with streamers outside your primary category
- **Maintain consistency** in scheduling and presence
- **Promote strategically** on other platforms, especially before streaming events

Success comes from genuine community building rather than follower accumulation.

## ðŸ”¨ Do

### Build Resilience Through Daily Exercises
Neuroscientist [Wendy Suzuki](https://www.wendysuzuki.com/) recommends these evidence-based practices:

- **Visualize positive outcomes** - Mental rehearsal strengthens neural pathways
- **Transform anxiety into progress** - Channel nervous energy toward productive action
- **Try something new** - Novel experiences build cognitive flexibility
- **Reach out to others** - Social connections strengthen resilience networks
- **Practice self-affirmations** - Positive self-talk improves stress response
- **Immerse in nature** - Natural environments reduce cortisol and improve mood

[Detailed guidance available here](https://www.cnbc.com/2021-08-31/do-these-exercises-every-day-to-build-resilience-and-mental-strength-says-neuroscientist.html).

### If you're too bright for others, they'll try to find some shade.
*Lisa Nichols*

---

This powerful observation connects to multiple themes in this issue: the harassment faced by academics online, the challenges of standing out in automated hiring systems, and the broader difficulty of maintaining authentic voice in conformist digital environments. Nichols reminds us that excellence often provokes resistance, but authenticity requires courage to remain bright despite others' attempts to dim our light.

The 18th-century perspective Ian references suggests that some challengesâ€”like dealing with those who try to diminish usâ€”remain constant across centuries, requiring timeless wisdom about resilience and community support.

### Newsletter Evolution Note
Issue #303 showcases Ian's growing expertise in connecting educational theory (UDL) with systemic analysis (automated hiring bias, social media regulation). The issue demonstrates sophisticated understanding of how individual teaching practices intersect with broader technological and policy challenges. The inclusion of institutional harassment policies shows practical wisdom about academic survival, while the Twitch discussion reveals his awareness of emerging digital communities. This represents clear evolution toward comprehensive digital literacy that encompasses pedagogy, policy, and platform dynamics.

[The smartest person in any room anywhere': in defence of Elon Musk, by Douglas Coupland](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/aug/29/the-smartest-person-in-any-room-anywhere-in-defence-of-elon-musk-by-douglas-coupland).

This post made the rounds in my circles online. I really like the closing statement:

*I think the biggest difference between the 20th century and the 21st is that in the 20th century you were able to see "the future" in your head. There were new ways of envisioning, say, an information utopia â€“ or an ecological harmonisation of humans with everything non-human. But here in the 21st century we're only able to possibly glimpse a small workable future, and even then only if we work at it incredibly hard. That's a huge difference in looking at what lies down the road.*
