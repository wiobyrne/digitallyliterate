## Collective Illusions  

Welcome to _Digitally Literate_, issue #330.  

This week, I reflected on the influence of social media, the promises of a more secure internet, and the perils of health apps in protecting our data.

- **Digital Privacy**: Mental health and prayer apps often have worse privacy protections than other app categories.  
- **Adapting to Change**: Effective change management requires rethinking how people perceive and respond to new challenges.
