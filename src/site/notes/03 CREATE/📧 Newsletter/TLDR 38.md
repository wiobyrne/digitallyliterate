You can review the follow up materials for this session here (https://medium.com/badge-chain/feedback-from-badgechain-presentation-on-open-badges-in-higher-education-call-48e44842b322#.cal8lwhz4) .

## 📺 Watch

Pop and Philosophy

Advice from The School of Life looking at the power and positioning of Pop...and what Philosophy could/should learn from Pop.

Really good advice on the ways that we can identify ways to connect pedagogy with the lives of students.

** What if we...ditch "best practices"? (https://amysmooc.wordpress.com/2016/03/24/rawthought-what-if-we-ditch-best-practices/)

Thoughtful piece by ** Amy Burvall (https://twitter.com/amyburvall)

problematizing our focus on experts and "fetishizing" their guidance.

Amy urges us to "stop being so sure of ourselves" and "become confident in our own uncertainty."

Read Amy's great post to think a bit more about how to embrace this uncertainty and experiment. As she mentions, let's start with the opening phrase "What if we..." and go from there.

** Remix as Professional Learning: Educator's iterative literacy practice in CLMOOC (http://www.mdpi.com/2227-7102/6/1/12)

I'm a big fan of the ** Connected Learning MOOC (http://educatorinnovator.org/clmooc/)

(CLMOOC) that runs each year. This is where I usually pick up extra skills to use in my classes and professional work two or three years before everyone else is using them.

I love the fact that members of the CLMOOC group are researching and publishing their practice.

Findings identify illuminated four distinct remix mobilities and relational tendencies: bursting, drifting, leveraging, & turning. Bursting and drifting characterize the paces and proximities of remixing while leveraging and turning are activities more obviously disruptive of social processes and power hierarchies. "These mobilities and tendencies revealed remix as an emergent, iterative, collaborative, critical practice with transformative possibilities for openly networked web-mediated professional learning."

** What the heck is interesting research?  (http://lemire.me/blog/2016/03/23/what-the-heck-is-interesting-research/)

Perspectives from ** Daniel Lemire (https://twitter.com/lemire)

looking at research and inquiry problems. This is a reminder to us all as we engage in thought and experimentation. The first bar should be is it of interest to us...and the community. The second should focus on whether or not your work is ambitious.

Thanks to Stephen Downes for ** originally sharing this (http://www.downes.ca/cgi-bin/page.cgi?post=65154)

** What will digital portfolios mean for college-bound students? (http://ww2.kqed.org/mindshift/2016/03/22/what-will-digital-portfolios-mean-for-college-bound-students/)

This post from MindShift examines the role of digital portfolios and assessments in the application process and induction into higher education.

The post discusses a couple interesting initiatives  underway to make this a viable transition, or marker of identity for learners.

I think there are tremendous opportunities to utilize and invigorate digital portfolios across spaces for leaners. I'm hoping some recent work in digital badges and blockchain technologies might accelerate this thinking.

## 🔨 Do

** Google Nik is now free (https://www.google.com/nikcollection/)

Nik is an ** advanced suite of tools (http://www.pcworld.com/article/3048347/software/googles-high-end-nik-collection-photo-software-is-now-free-and-probably-dead.html)

for photo and image editing. This is professional grade products that typically cost hundreds of dollars. You could and should start playing with this to see what you can create. This is definitely something to download and allow your students to use in class as well.

If you want the power of Nik, but built in to an ** iPhone/iPad (https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/snapseed/id439438619?mt=8)

or ** Android (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.niksoftware.snapseed&hl=en)
