Makerspaces are usually identified by using their hardware, software, and other technologies. This sometimes creates a shopping-list mentality among people interested in creating this learning environment.

I'm learning that a makerspace is defined not by what's in it but rather by what comes out of it: projects, experiences, artifacts, and learning.

This post shares 20 tools being used in one makerspace to provide guidance.
