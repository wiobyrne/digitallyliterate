## 📚 Readings & Insights

### 1. **The Scientific Method and Doing Research**
Democratizing research requires critically evaluating the scientific method and the process of “doing your own research.” This involves understanding the depth of methodologies and separating credible findings from noise. [Explore further](https://wiobyrne.com/doing-research/).

**Why this matters:** To build trust in science, we must empower individuals with the tools and knowledge to engage with it responsibly.

---

### 2. **Examining Human History and Evolution in Sapiens**
In *Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind*, Yuval Noah Harari offers a comprehensive exploration of human evolution, societal impact, and potential futures. It’s an essential read for understanding our shared history. [Learn more](https://wiobyrne.com/sapiens/).

**Why this matters:** Understanding our past is crucial to navigating the present and shaping the future.

### 3. **Extending the Attribution of Consciousness to AI**
As AI systems grow increasingly sophisticated, they challenge our assumptions about what it means to think, feel, and be conscious. These developments force us to reconsider how we attribute consciousness. [Read more](https://wiobyrne.com/extending-the-attribution-of-consciousness/).

**Why this matters:** While current AI is far from achieving true consciousness, its capabilities spark essential discussions about humanity’s uniqueness.

## 🛠️ DO: Reflect on Uncertainty

Embrace uncertainty and consider how shifting perspectives can lead to growth and innovation:
1. Question your assumptions.
2. Revisit and refine your perspectives as new information arises.
3. Seek alternate explanations to broaden your understanding.
