Welcome back to Digitally Literate and issue #265. Thanks for showing up this week. I appreciate you.

This week I worked on the following:

- *[Innovation & Execution](https://wiobyrne.com/innovation-execution/)* - When innovating, ideas without implementation mean nothing. Basically, talk is cheap. Back things up with action.
- *[How to cultivate self-awareness](https://wiobyrne.com/how-to-cultivate-self-awareness/)* - The struggle between internal self-awareness (how well you know yourself) and external self-awareness (how well you understand how others see you)…
- *[Look for the Good Apples](https://wiobyrne.com/look-for-the-good-apples/)* - A great primer on culture, the barrel…and being the good apple in the barrel while not getting spoiled.
- *[Fail Hard](https://wiobyrne.com/fail-hard/)* - If you set your goals high…you'll fail above everyone else's success.
- *[Computational Thinking](https://wiobyrne.com/computational-thinking/)* - I'll have a series of posts upcoming about computational thinking. Here's the first one.

### [Hilarious Halloween Mashup Combining the Beastie Boys' 'Intergalactic' With the 'Ghostbusters' Theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPIm1NnmVCc)

In keeping with his Halloween tradition, music meme creator William Maranci has hilariously combined the Beastie Boys song "Intergalactic" with the perfectly fitting "Ghostbusters" theme song by Ray Parker Jr.

You should also check out [this remix of Nine Inch Nails](https://laughingsquid.com/nine-inch-nails-remixed-ghostbusters/) and the Ghostbusters theme song by Maranci.

### [It's Google's World. We Just Live in It.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/20/technology/doj-google.html?0p19G=2103)

On Tuesday, the [Justice Department sued](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/20/technology/google-antitrust.html) it for anticompetitive practices, in the most significant antitrust action by the U.S. government against a technology company in decades. [The government's case](https://www.wsj.com/articles/justice-department-to-file-long-awaited-antitrust-suit-against-google-11603195203?mod=djemalertNEWS) focused on Google's search and how it appeared to create a monopoly through exclusive business contracts and agreements that locked out rivals.

[Google responded](https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/response-doj/) that this was a deeply flawed lawsuit that would only hurt consumers.

[Karl Bode in TechDirt suggests](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20201020/09563045541/bill-barrs-google-antitrust-inquiry-is-weaponized-farce.shtml) that this is a weaponized farce from Bill Barr and the US Department of Justice before the election.

Ben Thompson is a bit more measured in the review, while explaining a bit more about [Aggregation Theory](https://stratechery.com/concept/aggregation-theory/), is endemic to digital markets. Read more at his original [Aggregation Theory Article](https://stratechery.com/2015/aggregation-theory/).

It will be interesting to see how this case progresses. For now…pay attention and educate yourself. You also need to read up on aggregation theory and store that info for later. You'll need it on the quiz. :)

### [An Exam Surveillance Company Is Trying to Silence Critics With Lawsuits](https://www.vice.com/en/article/7k9zjy/an-exam-surveillance-company-is-trying-to-silence-critics-with-lawsuits)

Between August 23rd and 24th, [Ian Linkletter](https://twitter.com/Linkletter), a learning technology specialist at the University of British Columbia, began researching and tweeting about Proctorio, an online test-proctoring tool that monitors students for suspicious behavior while they take virtual exams. [Linkletter has become the target of a lawsuit](https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/22/21526792/proctorio-online-test-proctoring-lawsuit-universities-students-coronavirus), and says he has drained his savings while fighting back against the company's attempts to silence him.

You might consider donating to [the GoFundMe page](https://www.gofundme.com/f/stand-against-proctorio/) set up by Linkletter to fight this lawsuit.

### [2020 Student Technology Report: Supporting the Whole Student](https://library.educause.edu/resources/2020/10/2020-student-technology-report-supporting-the-whole-student)

This report presents results from EDUCAUSE's 2020 research on students' experience with information technology, which included 16,162 undergraduate students from 71 US institutions.

Findings identify next steps institutions can take and opportunities for connecting with peers who are implementing innovative practices in the areas of student success, technology use and environmental preferences, data privacy, online harassment, and accessibility.

### [How to retweet using Twitter's new temporary format](https://www.theverge.com/21524092/twitter-temporarily-changing-retweet-quote-tweet-election)

This is really interesting. In the remaining weeks before the 2020 US Elections, Twitter is limiting your ability to retweet content from others. More specifically, Twitter is urging you to give some context in your re-share…as opposed to blindly boosting the message of others.

### [Butterfly Attack: The Origins of Fake Social Media Accounts](https://mediamanipulation.org/case-studies/butterfly-attack-origins-fake-antifa-social-media-accounts)

As I follow online information trends, it's interesting to see the terms used to describe many of these practices. Here's some new info for your lexicon.

Throughout 2017, [**pranksters**](https://mediamanipulation.org/definitions/pranksters "Pranksters") and [**extremists**](https://mediamanipulation.org/definitions/extremists-right-wing "Extremists (right wing)") utilized parody accounts to discredit the antifascist movement in the US, taking advantage of available and official-sounding [**Twitter**](https://mediamanipulation.org/definitions/twitter "Twitter") handles and public confusion about antifascists to spread narratives about antifa violence and drive [**wedges**](https://mediamanipulation.org/definitions/wedge-issue "Wedge issue") between antifascists, Black Lives Matter [**activists**](https://mediamanipulation.org/definitions/activists "Activists"), and liberals. These **[butterfly attacks](http://mediamanipulation.org/definitions/butterfly-attack)** used [**keyword squatting**](https://mediamanipulation.org/definitions/keyword-squatting "Keyword Squatting") to capture attention during [**breaking news events**](https://mediamanipulation.org/definitions/breaking-news-event "Breaking news event"), and [**tactically** **adjusted**](http://test-gmmc.pantheonsite.io/definitions/tactical-adjustment) over the course of the year.

## 🔨 Do

### [Don't let the need for webcams trick you](https://er.educause.edu/blogs/2020/9/dear-professors-dont-let-student-webcams-trick-you)

Think more deeply about the requirements to have all students use their webcams during class.

## 🤔 Consider

### This is a beautiful life we lead in spite of whatever things come against us or whatever team loses or wins.

**Connected concepts**:
- [[Platform Monopoly and Aggregation Theory\|Platform Monopoly and Aggregation Theory]] - The Google antitrust lawsuit represents the first major challenge to tech platform monopolies in decades. Understanding Ben Thompson's Aggregation Theory becomes essential here: digital markets naturally concentrate power because platforms that aggregate user attention can leverage that into exclusive supplier relationships. The question isn't whether Google is powerful, but whether that power stems from anticompetitive behavior or inherent digital market dynamics.
- [[Surveillance Proctoring and Corporate Intimidation\|Surveillance Proctoring and Corporate Intimidation]] - Proctorio's lawsuit against Ian Linkletter for researching and criticizing their surveillance tools reveals how edtech companies weaponize legal systems to silence critics. A university researcher investigating student surveillance tools shouldn't face financial ruin for sharing findings. This connects to broader patterns where surveillance capitalism defends itself not through transparency but through intimidation and SLAPP-style lawsuits.
- [[Butterfly Attacks and Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior\|Butterfly Attacks and Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior]] - The term "butterfly attacks" describes coordinated networks of fake accounts using keyword squatting to hijack breaking news narratives and discredit movements. These 2017 anti-antifa parody accounts demonstrate how information warfare exploits platform design and public confusion. This tactical approach—creating wedges between allied movements during high-attention moments—connects to broader disinformation strategies that fragment opposition rather than directly defending positions.
