## Becoming Indistractable

Welcome back, all. Here is _Digitally Literate_, issue #321.

I posted the following this week:

- _[Developing a Culture of Inquiry](https://wiobyrne.com/developing-a-culture-of-inquiry/)_ - This week I presented a workshop focused on reading and supporting students as they interact in classes. This post includes my slide deck and a recording of the session.
- [Sharing What You Love](https://wiobyrne.com/sharing-what-you-love/) - What do you love about your disicpline, field, or job? Teaching is ultimately about sharing this love with others.
- [Sharpening the Saw of the Knowledge Worker](https://wiobyrne.com/sharpening-the-saw-of-the-knowledge-worker/) - My information processing workflow stinks. In this post, I break down my knowledge management systems and what challenges I've had.

## üìö This Week‚Äôs Highlights

### 1. **[Why we say ‚ÄúOK‚Äù](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UnIDL-eHOs)**  
The most widely recognized word on the planet started as a language fad in the 1830s. This video explores the fascinating history of ‚ÄúOK.‚Äù  
**Why this matters**: Understanding cultural phenomena helps us appreciate how language evolves.

### 2. **[The end of the metaverse, hopefully](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20220128-the-country-inoculating-against-disinformation)**  
Meta, the company that owns Facebook, had a very bad week. The company, on an earnings call, reported that it had lost users for the first time in its history. The market then responded. The company‚Äôs valuation [dropped $232 billion](https://www.cnbc.com/2022-02-03/facebooks-232billion-drop-in-value-sets-all-time-record.html), the biggest 24-hour drop in the stock market‚Äôs history.

There are a lot of reasons for this. Meta is betting big on the metaverse, which may be years off. A lot of the content shared on the social network is also mostly misinformation, right-wing outrage, and long videos that lead users to ultimately view an ad.

**Why this matters**: The narrative shift highlights user dissatisfaction and the risks of overreliance on disruptive tech trends.

- Turning values into time  
- Imposing constraints  
- Making the most of your time  

**Why this matters**: Attention is a finite resource. Allocating it wisely is key to thriving in the digital age.

### 4. **[Big Tech Must Stop Hiding](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/end-big-tech-financial-disclosures-free-pass-by-mariana-mazzucato-and-ilan-strauss-2022-01)**  
A major reason why Big Tech firms have achieved such scale and become the gatekeepers to entire markets is that they have been able to obscure most of their financial and operating data. There are obvious steps that regulators can take to close the reporting loopholes that the industry has been exploiting.

[In a new report](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/public-purpose/publications/2021/dec/crouching-tiger-hidden-dragons), researchers and scholars from the [UCL Institute for Innovation and Public Purpose](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/public-purpose/) argue that just as environmental, social, and governance reporting is essential to help navigate climate change, enhanced 10-K reporting is necessary to reveal the nature and extent of Big Tech‚Äôs market dominance. [A 10-K](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Form_10-K) is a comprehensive report filed annually by a publicly-traded company about its financial performance and is required by the [U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec.asp) (SEC). The report contains much more detail than a company's¬†[annual report](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/annualreport.asp), which is sent to its shareholders before an annual meeting to elect [company directors](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/boardofdirectors.asp).

Only through this transparency can we see if these giants owe their continued growth to value creation or to value extraction.
**Why this matters**: Transparency is essential for accountability and equitable innovation.

### 5. **[How I Quit My Smartphone Addiction and Reclaimed 7 Years of My Life](https://betterhumans.pub/how-i-quit-my-smartphone-addiction-and-reclaimed-10-years-of-my-life-57f4bfb1bbab)**  
Hamish Johnson shares strategies to reduce screen time, including app removal, parental controls, and leveraging simple tools like dumbphones and paper journals.  

Want to keep your iPhone or Android? Here is how to win the fight for your attention.

- _Level One_ - Delete the bad apps that will monopolize your attention, don't actually help you get stuff done, and do not [spark joy](https://konmari.com/marie-kondo-rules-of-tidying-sparks-joy/).
- _Level Two_ - If you cannot delete a stubborn system app, use the settings to at least disable it.
- _Level Three_ - Make it difficult to reinstall the bad apps. Use parental controls to only allow you to download apps appropriate for three year olds.
- _Level Four_ - Create a passcode to unlock your parent controls and give the code to someone else.

**Why this matters**: Reclaiming control over digital habits fosters focus and intentionality.

### 6. **[web3 and higher education](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IU_4bTPOUE&list=PLlcx8yl6hlPC3QjlbIHzxGqCP3qRa0zcg&index=3)**

## üõ†Ô∏è DO: Overcome Languishing  

If you feel restless or emotionally empty, you may be ‚Äúlanguishing.‚Äù Shift from languishing to flourishing by:  

1. Performing acts of kindness for others.  
2. Contributing to the greater good.  
3. Prioritizing meaningful connections.  

To understand how to reduce languishing, it‚Äôs important to understand the difference between languishers and flourishers (people who experience high levels of mental health). Languishers are more self-oriented ‚Äì wanting to find their own meaning and improve their own happiness. Flourishers, on the other hand, are more focused on others and contributing to the greater good. This can be in any form, such as performing acts of kindness for others (such as making someone a cup, helping a colleague at work, or even volunteering.
