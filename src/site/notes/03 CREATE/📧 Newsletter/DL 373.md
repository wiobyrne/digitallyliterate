## 📚 Readings & Insights

### 1. **Regulating AI Superintelligence**
[A new poll](https://theaipi.org/poll-shows-voters-oppose-open-sourcing-ai-models-support-regulatory-representation-on-boards-and-say-ai-risks-outweigh-benefits-2/), commissioned by the think tank AI Policy Institute and conducted by YouGov, surveyed 1,118 Americans from across the age, gender, race, and political spectrums in early September. It reveals that 63 percent of voters say regulation should aim to actively prevent AI superintelligence.

Many major AI companies are racing to build superintelligent AI, which they claim will benefit humanity. However, [Americans are questioning the potential risks and costs](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023-09-19/23879648/americans-artificial-general-intelligence-ai-policy-poll) that come with developing such technology and are increasingly distrusting tech executives.

**Why this matters:** Policymakers must prioritize public interests over corporate ambitions in shaping AI's future.

### 2. **The Changing American Classroom**
With the increasing number of school shootings and a lack of meaningful legislation to address gun violence, [American schools are taking safety measures into their own hands](https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2023/us/changing-classrooms-shooting-safety-dg/).

Google Search has evolved from a simple list of blue links into a multifaceted platform that encompasses mapping, a predictive engine, an encyclopedia, a chatbot, and a shopping mall. However, [it has become bloated and over-monetized](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/09/google-search-size-usefulness-decline/675409/), making it harder to find authoritative and uncompromised answers.

**Why this matters:** The decline of trusted search engines affects how we access and evaluate information.

### 4. **Unrealistic Optimism**
[Nate Bear](https://twitter.com/NateB_Panic) [discusses the concept of unrealistic optimism](https://donotpanic.substack.com/p/staring-at-the-tsunami) and identifies four cognitive factors that contribute to it. Bear suggests that people’s brains are wired to ignore the risks of certain events and that some individuals are better able to accurately assess risk.

**Why this matters:** Optimism must coexist with critical thinking to navigate today’s complex challenges.

### 5. **Friends Don’t Let Friends Ideate Collaboratively**
