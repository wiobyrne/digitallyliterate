## [The mess at Medium](https://www.theverge.com/2021-03-24/22349175/medium-layoffs-union-evan-williams-blogger-twitter-subscription)

When [Medium](https://medium.com/) first came out, I was in love. I had students write on the space. I developed several publications and shared my work there. In the nine years since the start of the writing space, things have perpetually gotten worse.

Things came to a head this week when Medium CEO and Twitter co-founder Ev Williams [sent an email to the entire Medium staff](https://ev.medium.com/medium-editorial-team-update-8679bcb9fe81) announcing that the company would like employees charged with doing journalism to feel free to quit and that the company would in fact be shifting away from professional journalism altogether.

In truth, it seems the situation was much worse. The platform has grown to include writing of every kind: viral posts about COVID-19; generic business wisdom; tech blogging; productivity porn; actual porn.

There is a lot to learn from this story. For me, the key lesson is about having a space of your own to write. Lately, I've been having thoughts about moving this newsletter to Substack. Lessons learned from Medium are a reminder to keep building our own spaces.

## [If Mark Zuckerberg won‚Äôt fix Facebook‚Äôs algorithms problem, who will?](https://www.vox.com/recode/22335801/algorithms-artificial-intelligence-facebook-instagram-recommendations)

It was quite the week for Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook.

The [CEOs of Facebook, Twitter, and Google testified before Congress](https://www.npr.org/2021-03-25/980510388/facebook-twitter-google-ceos-testify-before-congress-4-things-to-know) about the spread of extremism, hoaxes, and misinformation online.
Zuckerberg suggested in his written statement that Facebook has a great system in place, and that [their future competitors should be eliminated](https://www.inc.com/jason-aten/mark-zuckerberg-just-asked-congress-to-eliminate-all-of-facebooks-future-competition.html).

Research published by the Tech Transparency Project (TTP), a nonprofit watchdog organization, indicated that not only do [militia groups still remain](https://www.techtransparencyproject.org/articles/facebooks-militia-mess), but they're [using the space to build movements](https://www.techtransparencyproject.org/articles/white-supremacist-groups-are-thriving-on-facebook).

And...Facebook‚Äôs bullying and harassment policy explicitly [allows for users to call for the death of public figures](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/mar/23/facebook-guidelines-allow-for-users-to-call-for-death-of-public-figures).

## [what demoralization does to teachers](https://annehelen.substack.com/p/what-demoralization-does-to-teachers)

[Anne Helen Petersen](https://twitter.com/annehelen) on chronic burnout and exploitation.

‚ÄúDemoralization occurs when teachers cannot reap the moral rewards that they previously were able to access in their work. It happens when teachers are consistently thwarted in their ability to enact the values that brought them to the profession.‚Äù

*This is chronic burnout and deep demoralization as labor is increasingly under-funded, under-valued, and under-resourced.

Telling teachers they're great isn‚Äôt enough. If you value them, act, vote, and speak in a way that evidences that value. They have held a crumbling system together for so long. It‚Äôs time to give them relief ‚Äî and reconsider its construction.*

The following image from [Al Abbazia](http://martiniavenue.com/) seems to capture the moment.

## [Stanford researchers identify four causes for ‚ÄòZoom fatigue‚Äô and their simple fixes](https://news.stanford.edu/2021-02-23/four-causes-zoom-fatigue-solutions/)

**Excessive amounts of close-up eye contact is highly intense.** Solution - Take Zoom out of the full-screen option and reducing the size of the Zoom window relative to the monitor to minimize face size, and use an external keyboard to allow an increase in the personal space bubble between oneself and the grid.

**Seeing yourself during video chats constantly in real-time is fatiguing.** Solution - use the ‚Äúhide self-view‚Äù button, which one can access by right-clicking their own photo, once they see their face is framed properly in the video.

**Video chats dramatically reduce our usual mobility.** Solution - An external keyboard or monitor will allow you to sit back and doodle.

**The cognitive load is much higher in video chats.** Solution - Give yourself an audio-only break. Turn off your camera, and turn away from the screen.

You might want to also check out the Zoom Exhaustion Fatigue (ZEF) scale. The paper is [here](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3786329), and the survey is available [here](https://stanforduniversity.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_5w2JruIAQzOgiTI).

## [How politics tested Ravelry and the crafting community](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021-03-29/how-politics-tested-ravelry-and-the-crafting-community)

Thanks to one of my friends, I've been fascinated with [Ravelry](https://www.ravelry.com/account/login). Yes, you're right. The community site, organizational tool, and yarn & pattern database for knitters and crocheters. Here's the thing...I don't knit. :)

I am interested in the way they developed this community and networking space all focused on making.

This post discusses the challenges the developers had as they hoped that everyone would just behave while in the community.

## üî® Do

## [Zoom Escaper lets you sabotage your own meetings with audio problems, crying babies, and more](https://www.theverge.com/2021-03-15/22331744/zoom-escaper-sabotage-meetings-fake-audio-problems)

Had enough Zoom meetings? Can‚Äôt bear another soul-numbing day of sitting on video calls, the only distraction your rapidly aging face, pinned in one corner of the screen like a dying bug? Well, if so, then boy do we have the app for you. Meet [Zoom Escaper](https://zoomescaper.com/): a free web widget that lets you add an array of fake audio effects to your next Zoom Call, gifting you with numerous reasons to end the meeting and escape, while you still can.

## ü§î Consider

### I guess that‚Äôs what growing up is. Saying good-by to a lot of things. Sometimes it is easy and sometimes it isn‚Äôt. But it is all right.

*Beverly Cleary*

[Fagradalsfjall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fagradalsfjall) is a volcano about 25 kilometres from Reykjav√≠k, Iceland, which has been dormant for 6,000 years. On Friday, [a new vent opened up](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iceland-volcano-idUSKBN2BB2JZ) just to the south at Geldingadalir, which is forming a new volcano right now. This is the first eruption on Iceland‚Äôs Southern Peninsula in 800 years. And we can watch it happening [live via webcam](https://www.ruv.is/frett/2021-03-20/live-feed-from-iceland-volcano).

If you're really adventurous, [you can fly through it via drone](https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021-03-22/22344113/iceland-volcano-eruption-drone-footage-fagradalsfjall).
