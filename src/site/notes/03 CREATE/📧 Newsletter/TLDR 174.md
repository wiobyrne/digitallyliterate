## 📚 Read

### Facebook Betrayal

As regular TL;DR reader we've been painting this picture for some time. Narrative not hard to see although many shocked this week.

Facebook in business of keeping you on platform gathering info coaxing you to give more then selling to anyone paying top dollar. They've proven [they don't care about your best interests](https://wiobyrne.com/facebooks-secret-mood-experiment-and-the-challenges-of-living-online/) with [algorithm manipulation](https://wiobyrne.com/facebook-algorithms-articles-youre-not-meant-to-see/).

When users learned about Cambridge Analytica and 2016 election role Facebook dragged feet obfuscated and distracted. NYT reports when users learned Facebook compromised privacy allowing access to tens of millions to political data firm linked to Trump Facebook sought to deflect blame and mask problem extent.

[Facebook betrayed us](https://newrepublic.com/article/152253/facebook-betrayed-america). Does it matter? Probably not.

### [Amazon's HQ2 Spectacle Isn't Just Shameful—It Should Be Illegal](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/11/amazons-hq2-spectacle-should-be-illegal/575539/)

Fourteen months ago Amazon announced national beauty contest where cities could apply to win honor of landing second headquarters. Prize: 50,000 employees and glory of housing tech giant. Cost? Several billion in tax incentives and potential city face-lift. Last week Amazon would split HQ2 between Crystal City DC and Long Island City Queens.

Heard pundits suggesting government should have forced Amazon to place headquarters in area needing economic stimulation. I agree. Amazon doesn't care. Government wouldn't do it. We should have continued questions about power of these businesses become powerful entities.

### [Leave No Dark Corner: China's Social Credit System](https://mobile.abc.net.au/news/2018-09-18/china-social-credit-a-model-citizen-in-a-digital-dictatorship/10200278?fbclid=IwAR0jTQ34E0HY7cCy7pZhsS06LEXuD5ZUr8PsvXm9Rmr_ZI9No3_7wTyh3wY&pfmredir=sm)

China building digital dictatorship to exert control over 1.4 billion citizens. For some "social credit" brings privileges—for others punishment. Real world surveillance state involving constant tracking and judging all actions 24 hours a day.

Story making rounds over last year. Thoroughly recommend reviewing post and ideas presented.

### [Limit Social Media Use to 30 Minutes Daily to Feel Less Depressed](https://qz.com/quartzy/1459609/limiting-social-media-use-reduces-depression-say-researchers/)

New [study PDF](https://guilfordjournals.com/doi/pdf/10.1521/jscp.2018.37.10.751) in Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology by University of Pennsylvania researchers looked into causal side whether people actually feel better cutting down social media. Conclusion: "Our findings strongly suggest that limiting social media use to approximately 30 minutes per day may lead to significant improvement in well-being."

### [Brooklyn Students Hold Walkout Protesting Facebook-Designed Program](https://nypost.com/2018/11/10/brooklyn-students-hold-walkout-in-protest-of-facebook-designed-online-program/)

Brooklyn teens protesting high school's adoption of online program spawned by Facebook saying it forces them to stare at computers for hours and "teach ourselves."

Story provides interesting counter-narrative for those thinking teachers no longer needed in age of tech.

### Coaching Through Discomfort

HBR post about coaching others and positivity. Something to think about as we work with others or seek change in ourselves.

"I have two questions for you. One: Do you want to do better?"

If answer is "no" then to attempt to coach would be fool's errand.

"Yeah" he said.

"Here's my second question: Are you willing to feel the discomfort of putting in more effort and trying new things that will feel weird and different and won't work right away?"

## 🤔 Consider

> "Sooner or later, if man is ever to be worthy of his destiny, we must fill our hearts with tolerance." — Stan Lee

Finding somewhere you belong requires tolerance for others finding their own belonging. Facebook betrayal shows intolerance for user autonomy treating people as resources. Amazon HQ2 reveals intolerance for shared prosperity demanding subsidy. China social credit demonstrates intolerance for difference enforcing conformity through surveillance. Depression study suggests social media cultivates intolerance for present moment. Brooklyn students show tolerance matters in education—they're tolerant of technology but intolerant of replacement masquerading as enhancement. Coaching question about discomfort asks whether we're tolerant enough of our own awkwardness during growth. Stan Lee understood superhero stories are ultimately about tolerance—accepting difference, coexisting despite conflict, finding belonging without requiring conformity.
