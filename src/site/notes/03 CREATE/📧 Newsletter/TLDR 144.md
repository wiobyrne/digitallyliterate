### [Facebook Just Made a Shocking Admission, and We're All Too Exhausted to Notice](https://gizmodo.com/facebook-just-made-a-shocking-admission-and-were-all-t-1825009566)

This week has been quite eventful for Facebook. Next week is going to be worse.

Facebook has been sliding in their indications of what they knew was happening behind the scenes with your data. Soon after the 2016 U.S. election [Mark Zuckerberg indicated that it was ridiculous](https://www.vox.com/2018/4/2/17185052/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-interview-fake-news-bots-cambridge) that Facebook had anything to do with the results. As time wore on, they've slowly let on a little bit at a time how much their social network was leveraged. As regular readers of TL;DR, we've been following this story from the beginning.

This week, Facebook has been flooding the zone with multiple press conferences, conference calls, and interviews. Zuckerberg held [a conference call](https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/04/hard-questions-protecting-peoples-information/) in which the takeaway was that Facebook ["didn't do enough."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogAi10evEEM) I recommend listening to the [full conference call here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8n0Bcv_DwM). [Sheryl Sandberg admitted they dropped the ball](https://www.ft.com/content/9e973ba4-3903-11e8-8eee-e06bde01c544), and [advertisers are "pushing pause"](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-05/facebook-s-sandberg-says-a-few-advertisers-paused-spendingv) on ad buys. Facebook also released that [most of its 2 billion users](http://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-87-million-cambridge-analytica-data-2018-4) have had their data scraped by "malicious actors."

Oh...and I didn't mention that there is evidence that Facebook is [watching your private messages](https://www.cultofmac.com/539603/facebook-spies-on-your-messages-to-make-sure-youre-being-good/) or [deleting personal messages](https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/05/zuckerberg-deleted-messages/) if/when Zuckerberg contacts you. Finally, the social network is [pausing a secret research project](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/05/facebook-building-8-explored-data-sharing-agreement-with-hospitals.html) in which they wanted to study the social connections of their most vulnerable patients.

Next week, Zuckerberg is set to [testify before the U.S. Congress](https://www.wired.com/story/mark-zuckerberg-congress-testimony/), while he [will not speak to anyone in the UK](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/27/facebook-mark-zuckerberg-declines-to-appear-before-uk-fake-news-inquiry-mps). There are rumors that the [social network will send out notifications to users](https://www.techly.com.au/2018/04/05/monday-facebook-will-tell-cambridge-analytica-accessed-personal-data/) on Monday to let you know if your data was scraped.

### [Don't fix Facebook. Replace it.](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/03/opinion/facebook-fix-replace.html)

[Tim Wu](https://twitter.com/superwuster)'s piece in the NY Times details the ways in which Facebook has failed, and the need for competitors to offer something better. As we've seen over the last couple of months/years, Facebook has been playing it fast and loose in terms of our data and identity on their site…and how they're manipulating your feed to keep you on there for longer periods of time.

It's also important to recognize that Facebook is acting as they are designed to act. You are the product that is being sold. If you share content openly on Facebook (or other social spaces) you cannot be surprised if/when people can "scrape" that data.

Wu notes:

> What comes after Facebook? Yes, we have come to depend on social networks, but instead of accepting an inherently flawed Facebook monopoly, what we most need now is a new generation of social media platforms that are fundamentally different in their incentives and dedication to protecting user data. Barring a total overhaul of leadership and business model, Facebook will never be that platform.

### [Unknown Tech Brands Aren't Like Groceries. Don't Just Grab Them.](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/04/technology/personaltech/beware-unknown-tech-brands.html)

[Brian X. Chen](https://twitter.com/bxchen) with a reminder about what we should really learn from all of this Facebook news. You should hesitate before sharing your data with an unknown brand, tech tool or service.

Chen notes:

> This applies to just about everything that touches your personal technology, including the apps that you download to your phone or computer and the free online services that you use. And, yes, it also includes those seemingly harmless personality tests run by some unfamiliar organization on Facebook — the kind that helped Cambridge Analytica get the data on users.

> It's time to stop using technology and the internet as though you were shopping at a supermarket. In a grocery store, you can reasonably assume that the food labels are accurate and the products safe to eat, because the food industry is heavily regulated. The handling of personal digital information, in contrast, is loosely regulated. There have been scores of obscure companies baiting you with products that purport to improve your life — but actually capitalize on your data.

### [How America's largest local TV owner turned its news anchors into soldiers in Trump's war on the media](https://theconcourse.deadspin.com/how-americas-largest-local-tv-owner-turned-its-news-anc-1824233490)

I know that it can be difficult, but we need to try and remove the lens of politics and our individual tribes before reading the next story.

One of the things we've discussed over the past couple of months is the need for more [media literacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_literacy) in our classrooms. [Critical media literacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_literacy#Critical_media_literacy) expands this by integrating different cultural elements, including politics. The challenge for educators is that you want to provide your students with information, help contextualize it, keep your bias and perspectives out of it, and let them make up their own minds.

This story about the Sinclair Broadcast Group, and the video remix of the anchors, is an opportunity to teach media literacy for the next decade.

### [The role of social media in adolescent/teen depression and anxiety](http://www.digitalethics.org/essays/role-social-media-adolescentteen-depression-and-anxiety)

The adolescent & teen years have always been a challenging time. Peer pressure, insecurity & hormones are just some of the issues facing those in these age groups. But does social media exacerbate these problems?

This post from the Center for Digital Ethics & Policy shares recent research on the topic and relation to screentime. The piece concludes by asking who is responsible for the role of social media in adolescent/teen depression and anxiety?

### [Owning your digital presence](https://readwriterespond.com/2018/04/owning-your-digital-presence/)

This great post by [Aaron Davis](https://twitter.com/mrkrndvs) is exactly what I've needed this week. It may not look like it...but it's exactly what you need as well. Let me explain why.

As I help students and colleagues build up their digital identity, I indicate the need for them to have one URL or domain that they own and control. At this one hub, they can connect all of the loose ends and write themselves into being.

The challenge is that we're often split into a bunch of different silos, social networks, and tools. The reason is that the companies and developers of these tools want it that way. Google doesn't want to help Facebook, and Facebook doesn't want to help Twitter. As a result, we've got a little bit of our identity in one place, and a different part in another. These companies also do not make it easy at all to connect the dots.

I think the answer is to have that one hub that you use to connect those dots. Davis makes this point through a conversation with good friend [Amy Burvall](https://twitter.com/amyburvall). Aaron extends this by looking at the spaces in which he exists online. He also gives insight into the [PESOS](https://indieweb.org/PESOS) and [POSSE](https://indieweb.org/POSSE) models.

I'll modify Aaron's statement to make my point here:

> I think that you should do more to own your presence. What if you actually collected together your media and stories into one space. I think that many of us face that same conundrum.

I'm in the process of changing up my signals and will have announcements soon. This will be a big game changer...for me.
