Welcome back to Digitally Literate and issue #262.

This week I worked on the following:

- *[Become a Digitally Literate Educator](https://wiobyrne.com/become-a-digitally-literate-educator/)* - I'm building up an [open, online course](https://digitallyliterate.net/educator/) for educators in Pre-K up through higher ed that want to be digitally literate in teaching, learning, & assessment. Enjoy. :)
- *[Control Your Controllables: Preparing for the Post-COVID Classroom](https://wiobyrne.com/control-your-controllables-post-covid-classroom/)* - This week I gave a virtual keynote to the keynote virtually to the [Virginia College Literacy Educators](http://virginiacollegereadingeducators.org/). The [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mKBfnHpK4ZPyPR-G7A7S0XGd6dEdgjalpsK9itK98dY/edit?usp=sharing) and text for this address are here. I'll share the video if/when it is made available.
- *[What's on the other side of failure? Nothing](https://wiobyrne.com/whats-on-the-other-side-of-failure-nothing/)* - Many times the only thing stopping us, or holding us back is self-doubt, and a lack of belief in our abilities. The truth is that there is nothing on the other side of failure.
- *[Trading Up The Chain](https://wiobyrne.com/trading-up-the-chain/)* - This post discusses the recent Joe Biden earpiece conspiracy theory, and the broader challenge of memes and disinformation systems.
- *[Value In Finishing](https://wiobyrne.com/value-in-finishing/)* - This week I finalized and submitted my tenure and promotion packet. This post is an ode to this moment.
- *[De-hypnotizing Ourselves](https://wiobyrne.com/de-hypnotizing-ourselves/)* - We often hypnotize ourselves to believe what we want to believe, or see what we want to see about ourselves. The real truth is that in many ways, we're believing what others want to see in us.

[Doug Belshaw had this great post](https://dougbelshaw.com/blog/2020/09/15/working-out-loud/) about working out loud which was [inspired by Austin Kleon's book](https://medium.com/show-your-work/10-ways-to-share-your-creativity-and-get-discovered-7fb5fdfbc068).

The video I share above is Brian Johnson's review of five big ideas from the same text.

### [The case for quarantining extremist ideas](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/01/extremist-ideas-media-coverage-kkk)

This week we heard a lot in the news about the [Proud Boys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proud_Boys), and white supremacist groups that promote and engage in political violence.

This piece by [Joan Donovan](https://twitter.com/BostonJoan) and [danah boyd](https://www.danah.org/) discusses the topic of *strategic silence*.

By avoiding amplifying extremist ideas, are we starving them of oxygen in the informational space?

### [Study Finds 'Single Largest Driver' of Coronavirus Misinformation: Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/30/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-misinformation.html)

Cornell University researchers analyzing 38 million English-language articles about the pandemic found that President Trump was the largest driver of the "infodemic."

The [study](https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/evanega-et-al-coronavirus-misinformation-submitted-07-23-20-1/080839ac0c22bca8/full.pdf) is the first comprehensive examination of coronavirus misinformation in traditional and online media.

This study identifies and analyzes the most prominent topics of COVID-related misinformation that emerged in traditional media between January 1 and May 26, 2020 based on a total sample of over 38 million articles published in English-language media around the world.

While on the topic of COVID, [this piece](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/09/k-overlooked-variable-driving-pandemic/616548/) by [Zeynep Tufekci](https://twitter.com/zeynep) asks why some people and areas are super-spreaders…and others are not.

### [How It Feels When Software Watches You Take Tests](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/29/style/testing-schools-proctorio.html)

One of my students needed to take a test virtually this past week and immediately relayed to our class the challenges of testing online and dealing with virtual proctors.

This post shares insight on software designed to flag students cheating on tests by doing things like tracking eye movements via a webcam. In a related story, other students [indicated](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/04/01/online-proctoring-college-exams-coronavirus/) that it felt callous and unfair to be suspected of cheating because they read test questions aloud, had snacks on their desks or did other things that the software deemed suspicious.

As a result, some of my students are indicating that they may put their health, and the health of others, in jeopardy and head out to physical locations to test.

### [Connecting with Youth through Authenticity and Collaboration](https://joanganzcooneycenter.org/2020/09/15/connecting-with-youth/)

Media companies around the world are finding out that when it comes to capturing the attention of youth, authenticity (or at least a sense of it) equals relevancy.

Anyone who has worked in a middle or high school setting can also confirm that teenagers are human lie detectors, unafraid to call out a lack of genuineness when they see it.

Armed with this realization, content creators and distributors continue vying for this group's attention, through ever-changing media platforms in an increasingly interconnected digital space.

### [Reimagining Learning Spaces for Uncertain Times](https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/read/64234704/the-blue-dot-12-reimagining-learning-spaces-for-uncertain-times)

This great resource from [UNESCO MGIEP](https://mgiep.unesco.org/) shares insight on the possibilities for a post-pandemic world.

## 🤔 Consider

With the news that President Trump has tested positive for the coronavirus, the fast-moving information system that is the Internet has kicked into high gear. As a result, it can be hard to separate truth from fiction. It can also be hard to not be emotionally manipulated online.

[This guide from The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/21276897/fake-news-facebook-twitter-misinformation-lies-fact-check-how-to-internet-guide) and [this from The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/06/05/stop-spreading-misinformation/) are two resources to help avoid being part of the problem.

**Connected concepts**:
- [[Strategic Silence and Extremism Quarantine\|Strategic Silence and Extremism Quarantine]] - Joan Donovan and danah boyd's "strategic silence" concept challenges the journalism norm that sunlight disinfects extremism. By amplifying Proud Boys and white supremacist ideas in the name of coverage, media provides oxygen in informational space. The question becomes whether quarantining extremist ideas through reduced coverage actually starves movements of recruitment opportunities, or whether silence allows radicalization to proceed unchallenged in darker corners of the internet.
- [[Trump Infodemic and Institutional Amplification\|Trump Infodemic and Institutional Amplification]] - The Cornell study identifying Trump as the single largest COVID misinformation driver across 38 million articles reveals how institutional media amplifies falsehoods by covering them. Every fact-check article, every "Trump falsely claims" headline spreads the misinformation to new audiences. This connects to broader questions about whether journalistic norms designed for good-faith actors inadvertently weaponize platforms when covering systematic liars.
- [[Proctoring Surveillance Perverse Incentives\|Proctoring Surveillance Perverse Incentives]] - Students choosing to risk COVID exposure rather than endure webcam surveillance reveals the technology's failure. Software flagging students for reading aloud, having snacks, or normal test-taking behaviors creates such anxiety that physical danger seems preferable. This connects to surveillance capitalism's broader pattern: technologies deployed to solve trust problems end up generating new harms that exceed the original issue.
