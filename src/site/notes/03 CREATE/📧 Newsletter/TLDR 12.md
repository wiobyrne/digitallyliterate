Thank you once again for signing up for this newsletter. In this newsletter, I'll synthesize and share the news from the week in literacy, technology, and education that I think you should know. Thanks again for the support. :)

This week I posted:

* Using Vialogues to scaffold student use of video and dialogue in the classroom (http://wiobyrne.com/using-vialogues-to-scaffold-student-use-of-video-and-dialogue-in-the-classroom/)  - This week I started testing the use of Vialogues (https://vialogues.com/) in my classroom to support students as they review and discuss YouTube clips. The initial feedback has been supportive...I just need to figure out how to integrate it into our online discussion boards a bit better.

A great video from Boyd Maxwell and Perry Schmidt as they report on the latest developments in the exciting world of pro teaching.

Wouldn't it be great if this was true?

** he danger of being neighborly without a permit (http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2015/02/little-free-library-crackdown/385531/)

An interesting post from ** The Atlantic (http://www.theatlantic.com/)

looking at the rising trend of local municipalities that are requiring that people tear down their "give one, take one" book exchanges because they don't have the proper permit.

** Colleges struggle to blend tech, teacher-training lesson plans (http://www.usnews.com/news/college-of-tomorrow/articles/2015/09/01/teachers-colleges-struggle-to-blend-technology-into-teacher-training-lesson-plans)

Report from the ** College of Tomorrow (http://www.usnews.com/news/college-of-tomorrow/articles/2015/09/01/teachers-colleges-struggle-to-blend-technology-into-teacher-training-lesson-plans)

section of ** U. S. News & World Report (http://www.usnews.com/)

on the challenges of preparing teachers that are digitally savvy...while being able to handle all of the other requirements of the job.

In my opinion, there is a ton of opportunity in this area. I've worked (and currently work) in pre-service teacher education. I also developed and facilitated a ** program (http://wiobyrne.com/?s=IT%26DML)

while at UNH that helped practicing teachers authentically and effectively use tech in the classroom. I think there is a multi-pronged approach. The first is to embed tech in pre-service programs...and scale up the skill level used by higher ed faculty. The second is to support practicing educators as they reach out and identify programs, or non-traditional opportunities (MOOCs) to build their skill-set.

I'll share more about these opportunities in upcoming issues of TL;DR.

** Why I'm saying goodbye to Apple, Google, and Microsoft (https://medium.com/backchannel/why-i-m-saying-goodbye-to-apple-google-and-microsoft-78af12071bd)

Great piece by tech columnist Dan Gilmour as he discusses his long-term frustration and ultimate decision to distance himself from the lack of control he had with these large corporations.

This piece is definitely worth a read as you try and understand the problems in the current system...and foreseeable future. The main problem is that Dan is very tech savvy, and not everyone might have the skillset, or time to build the infrastructure that he has. Perhaps we need companies that provide alternative models.

** How to think visually using visual analogies (http://anna.vc/post/112863438962/how-to-think-using-visual-analogies)

An excellent resource from Anns Vital showcasing a variety of examples for anyone thinking about developing your own graphics. I've been trying to push my own thinking by trying to create and use more illustrations in my teaching and blogging. As part of this I'm experimenting with ** sketchnoting (http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/11/how-to-get-started-with-sketchnotes/)

, and animated GIFs. An example of this is shown in the quotes embedded in images I'll start sharing each week. I hope to later share more on my learning.

a street-view version of a port city 70 miles outside of the city from the vantage point of a cat. ** Click here to go directly to the map (http://hiroshima-welcome.jp/kanpai/catstreetview/index_2_on.html)
