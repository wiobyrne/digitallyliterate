Happy weekend all. It's good to see your faces.

This week I posted the following:

- [Shine](https://wiobyrne.com/shine/) - A look back at the last year of my life.
- [The Harm in Do No Harm](https://wiobyrne.com/the-harm-in-do-no-harm/) - There's a difference between do no harm and immersion, investing, and accompaniment.
- [Intersectionality in Ed Tech](https://wiobyrne.com/intersectionality-in-educational-technology/) - An intersectional framework acknowledges social systems creating barriers for some while providing privilege for others.
- [Computational Thinking for the Educator and Researcher](https://wiobyrne.com/computational-thinking-for-the-educator-researcher/) - Computational thinking as a problem-solving practice for meaningful interaction with content and CT practices.

### [Missing the Noise of School - Trevor Muir](https://trevormuir.com/)

Many of us were told that a quiet classroom is a good classroom. Then we had a pandemic, and now so many of us miss the noise.

I can't believe I haven't come across [Trevor Muir](https://trevormuir.com/) until now. Thanks to Verena Edwards for sharing. :)

The story and [discussion guides are here](https://mailchi.mp/9c45fc770638/missing-the-noise-of-school-8111618).

### [Pandemic Preparedness Report: Global Leadership Failures](https://theindependentpanel.org/)

This week, the CDC [updated guidance](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated-guidance.html) indicating fully vaccinated individuals can participate in indoor and outdoor activities—large or small—without masks or physical distancing.

As we turn a corner, I'm hoping we've used this as an opportunity to learn lessons.

A new report from the [Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response](https://theindependentpanel.org/) lambasts global leaders who failed to heed repeated warnings, wasted time, hoarded information and desperately needed supplies, and failed to take the crisis seriously.

> "While some countries took aggressive steps to curb the spread, many countries, including some of the wealthiest, devalued the emerging science, denied the disease's severity, delayed responding, and ended up sowing distrust among citizens with literally deadly consequences." — Helen Clark, cochair of the panel

### [Social Isolation During COVID-19 Lockdown Impairs Cognitive Function](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/acp.3821)

Research from [Joanne Ingram](https://twitter.com/jojosuperstar19), [Christopher J. Hand](https://twitter.com/drcjhand), and [Greg Maciejewski](https://scholar.google.pl/citations?user=KzuUdqIAAAAJ&hl=en) examining social isolation's effect on cognitive function.

Results suggest social isolation is linked to cognitive decline in the absence of aging covariates. The impact should be considered when implementing prolonged pandemic-related restrictive conditions.

[More on this story here](https://theconversation.com/lockdown-mental-fatigue-rapidly-reversed-by-social-contact-study-finds-158154).

### [Remote Work Made Digital Nomads Possible. The Pandemic Made Them Essential](https://www.fastcompany.com/90631452/remote-work-made-digital-nomads-possible-the-pandemic-made-them-essential)

Special visas. Free vaccines. Tax breaks.

The pandemic was an existential crisis for the community built around having no fixed address—forced to shelter in place for the first time.

Now countries around the world are courting a new class of human capital that wants to mix travel and work forever.

### [It's True. Everyone Is Multitasking in Video Meetings](https://www.wired.com/story/stop-looking-your-email-youre-video/)

Microsoft study finds just how often remote workers multitask during videoconferences—especially when the group is large and the meeting runs long.

The study shows multitasking during virtual meetings is a coping mechanism to protect people's mental well-being from... too many virtual meetings.

### [How the Pentagon Started Taking U.F.O.s Seriously](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/05/10/how-the-pentagon-started-taking-ufos-seriously)

For decades, flying saucers were a punch line. Then the U.S. government got over the taboo.

In a [memorandum](https://media.defense.gov/2021/May/04/2002633947/-1/-1/1/D2021-DEV0SN-0116.000_REDACTED.PDF) issued this week, the Pentagon's watchdog confirmed a new probe with primary objective: "to determine the extent to which the DOD has taken actions regarding Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP)."

Next month, a government report on UAP sightings is expected to be made public.

## 🔨 Do

### [Shakkei: The Art of Borrowed Landscape](https://www.japanhouse.jp/shakkei)

The ancient East Asian concept of shakkei, which translates to "borrowed landscape" or "borrowed scenery," can help connect your home with surrounding views.

While shakkei refers to the traditional technique of incorporating an outside view into a garden design, the concept also offers inspiration for connecting built forms with nature in a profound manner.

Applying shakkei successfully involves more than simply framing a view. It requires careful analysis of landscape and surrounding elements to create a composition with depth, scale, and texture that integrates the "borrowed scenery" in a poetic way.

## 🤔 Consider

### You better get a grip on yourself or you won't be around too long.

*Rollins Band*

The Rollins Band's warning about grip connects to this issue's threads—cognitive decline from isolation, the multitasking coping mechanism in endless video meetings, and pandemic failures from leaders who lost grip on reality. Connection—outside with inside—is how we hold on.

Bonus: I knew I shared a birthday with George Lucas. This week I learned I also share one with Mark Zuckerberg. Ugghhh...
