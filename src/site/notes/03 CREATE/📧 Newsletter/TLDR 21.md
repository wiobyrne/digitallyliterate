This week I worked on the following:

* Publishing your content online and syndicating it elsewhere (http://wiobyrne.com/publishing-your-content-online-and-syndicating-it-elsewhere/) - As I continue my look at Medium and guiding others as they get started, I recognize that fact that many of my colleagues already blog. The question I had to answer was "why should I should move over to Medium. In this post I discuss the opportunity to syndicate, or re-post your own content. View the piece syndicated on Medium here (https://medium.com/the-slackerati/publishing-your-content-online-and-syndicating-it-elsewhere-5925ec2b6dee) .

The School of Life - How Proust can change your life

I've been diving deeper and deeper into philosophy over the past year. I'm regretting the lack of this content in my earlier education.

To get jump started, go listen to ** this interview with Alain de Botton (http://fourhourworkweek.com/2015/11/10/alain-de-botton/)

. It's just under two hours. Go for a walk, do the dishes, paint a picture. Listen to this interview on ** iTunes (https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-tim-ferriss-show/id863897795?mt=2)

, ** Stitcher (http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/the-tim-ferriss-show)

, or your favorite podcasting app. You need to listen to this. :)

I'm also subscribing to ** The School of Life (http://www.theschooloflife.com/london/)

on ** YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/user/schooloflifechannel/featured)

after listening to Alain on the podcast.

** alman Rushdie on fiction, ISIS, and the war on pleasure (http://www.slate.com/articles/podcasts/the_moment/2015/09/salman_rushdie_on_fiction_isis_and_the_war_on_pleasure.html)

Dear reader...IMHO that title for this blog post is terrible. Despite the title of the post...you should listen to this interview (** Soundcloud (https://soundcloud.com/panoply/the-moment-salman-rushdie-92915)

, ** iTunes (https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/moment-brian-koppelman/id814550071?mt=2&uo=6&at=11lQck&ct=moment)

) with Salman Rushdie on ** The Moment Podcast (http://www.slate.com/articles/podcasts/the_moment.html)

.

The podcast is under an hour long. I think the beginning was excellent and the ending fantastic. To me the interview was more about writing, creativity, magic, evil, and pleasure.

For those of you that create, write, make, teach, or learn...this is another bit of insight that I believe you'll value.

** Writing sci-fi for the stage...and the ears (http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2015/11/the_message_author_mac_rogers_on_the_podcast_and_his_plays_the_honeycomb.html)

Many of you enjoyed the ** Serial podcast (http://serialpodcast.org/)

. I talked with many people that loved listening and trying to solve the mystery online. I talked tons of teachers that listened to and discussed the podcast with their students.

If you like science, sci-fi, extraterrestrials, cypher/crypto...then you need to listen to ** The Message (http://themessagepodcast.com/)

.

The post above is a discussion with the creator, Mac Rogers, and digs in to the "rules" of writing for the stage and serialized drama.

** Why writers run (http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/11/why-writers-run/415146/)

Now that I've given you a ton of things to go listen to...you might be wondering what else to do during that time.

This piece by ** Nick Ripatrazone (https://twitter.com/nickripatrazone)

on ** The Atlantic (http://www.theatlantic.com/)

is about much more than writers running. To me it was about creativity, inspiration, and creating quiet in the mind to make that happen.

I've blogged in the past about my own ** 30 day challenge (http://wiobyrne.com/the-30-day-challenge/)

(that has become a habit) ** with meditation (http://wiobyrne.com/meditation-mindfulness-gaining-headspace-in-my-workflow/)

. I think we need to find opportunities to clear our heads out, calm the mind, and let the wonderous machine that is our brain do its work.

If you're looking at other opportunities to clear out your own head...I recommend checking out ** Laura Hilliger's (https://twitter.com/epilepticrabbit)

** How video games can teach your brain to fight depression (http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2015/11/how_video_games_can_teach_your_brain_to_fight_depression.html)

This Slate article by ** Jane McGonigal (https://twitter.com/avantgame)

discusses the benefits of gaming, and specifically a "gameful" mindset as you approach daily challenges.

You can learn more by checking out the ** SuperBetter (https://www.superbetter.com/)

** book (http://www.amazon.com/dp/1594206368/?tag=slatmaga-20)

and app. Or, as I learned from her ** interview on the Tim Ferriss podcast (http://fourhourworkweek.com/2015/07/28/jane-mcgonigal/)

...install Tetris on your phone and play it for five minutes at the end of the night. I play ** Tetroid on Android (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.oblius.tetroid&hl=en)

as I've had troubles finding a good Tetris app that isn't junked up with ads and fluff.

While we're discussing the positive potential of games to heal...there is ** new research (http://www.researchgate.net/publication/280294047_Challenging_games_help_students_learn_An_empirical_study_on_engagement_flow_and_immersion_in_game-based_learning)

** The digital revolution in higher education has already happened. No one noticed. (https://medium.com/@cshirky/the-digital-revolution-in-higher-education-has-already-happened-no-one-noticed-78ec0fec16c7)

Great piece by ** Clay Shirky (https://twitter.com/cshirky)

in which he discusses the new normal...online education is a fundamental part of our experience in higher ed. The challenge is that it appears that we haven't put that much thought into what it could, or should be.

He states:

Given the lousy fit between institutional assumptions and the actual lives of most students, we should applaud their inventiveness in using digital options to make college work for them. But we should also recognize our complicity in creating a system that works so badly in the first place. Online classes are no longer surprising, or experimental, or rare. By adopting them, students are telling us what they need our institutions to become.

I agree with the points that he makes. I am concerned for what is happening in K-12 education.

** A different approach to coding (https://medium.com/bright/a-different-approach-to-coding-d679b06d83a)

This post by Mitch Resnick and David Siegel, students have tremendous opportunities to make and remake themselves as they learn to code. In the post they provide some framing for the ** 2015 Hour of Code (https://hourofcode.com/us)

that will be lunched by ** Code.org (https://code.org/)

.

They discuss a need to understand the motivations and perspectives that promote this focus on coding and programming. They view it as more of a literacy as opposed to preparing workers for the future.

In the post they state:

As young people express themselves with Scratch, they begin to think of themselves differently, just as they do when they learn to write. The Brazilian educator Paulo Freire recognized that writing is more than just a practical skill. He led literacy campaigns in poor communities not simply to help people get jobs, but to help people learn that, in his words, “they can make and remake themselves.”

## 🔨 Do

If you're interested in building up your own skill set in coding...or bringing it into your classroom, I recommend checking out this ** Star Wars themed coding program (https://code.org/starwars)

from ** Code.org (https://code.org/)

.

Use drag and drop blocks to help Rey and BB-8 negotiate the backgrounds. Recommended for kids ages 11 and up, it's good exposure for coding...and the upcoming movie. :)
