## Sometimes You Gotta Fly

**Published**: August 10, 2019 • [[03 CREATE/📧 Newsletter/📧 Newsletter\|📧 Newsletter]]

Welcome to *Digitally Literate*, issue 209. Your go-to source for insightful content on education, technology, and the digital landscape.

This week I sent out the following:

- _[Truth, lies, and learning in an online disinformation war](https://wiobyrne.com/truth-lies-learning-in-an-online-disinformation-war/)_ - In this post I pull together some of the challenges in online literacy as individuals are actively confused through propagation of disinformation.
- _[Barefoot for Dai](https://breadcrumbs.wiobyrne.com/barefootfordai-ripdai-daibarnes/)_ - Some thoughts and a barefoot walk.

## 🔖 Key Takeaways
- **Mass Shootings Research Since 1966**: NIJ-funded study identifies four commonalities—early childhood trauma/violence exposure, identifiable crisis point weeks/months before, access to other shooters' ideologies/validation, access to firearms
- **Rick Rubin Barefoot Philosophy**: Shangri-La documentary—earth electrical/magnetic energy into body if naked on it, reminds of Dai Barnes barefoot walking
- **El Paso Gamification of Terror**: Robert Evans investigates 8chan "high scores"—white nationalist terror gamified by lonely white men seeking identity/acclaim
- **8chan Shutdown Calls**: Creator Frederick Brennan calls to shut down—free speech utopia became mass shooter megaphone, Cloudflare stopped protection
- **Workforce Automation Paradox**: Study shows people prefer robot replaces them over human, but upset if robot takes colleague's job—can't figure out logic
- **39 Invisible Galaxies Discovered**: Breakthrough approach looking deeper than ever—could solve supermassive black holes/dark matter mysteries

## 📺 Watch

### ["Rick Rubin" by Alison Chernick (2:50)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RB1yAAkrcbg&feature=youtu.be)

Last weekend I needed a break from the news so I sat down to finally binge watch the documentary series titled _Shangri-La_ on Showtime. The four part series follows legendary producer Rick Rubin as he tours his Malibu studio.

The [series is an interesting look](https://variety.com/2019/music/news/rick-rubin-shangri-la-showtime-things-we-learned-1203271488/) at the components and culture of creativity. One thing in particular that I noticed was that Rubin indicated that he wears no shoes everyday.

_In a conversation with Tyler the Creator, Rubin says, "The earth actually has an electrical and magnetic energy that goes into our body if we are naked on it, and if we're covered all the time, we don't get to feel it. In terms of health and in terms of knowing things, part of the life source is being tapped into the earth."_

I played this part over a couple times, and reflected on how interesting (wacky) this was. I also thought about the only other person that I knew that walked around barefoot…[Dai Barnes](http://daibarnes.info/).

I have a lot to say about this, but I'm honestly still processing. I would recommend checking out these great posts from [Aaron Davis](https://readwriterespond.com/2019/08/remembering-dai-barnes/) and [Tim Klapdoor](https://timklapdor.wordpress.com/2019/08/05/voices-on-the-air/).

### [We have studied every mass shooting since 1966. Here's what we've learned about the shooters.](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2019-08-04/el-paso-dayton-gilroy-mass-shooters-data)

A must read op-ed. Two researchers share findings from a National Institute of Justice funded research looking at the life histories of mass shooter in the US. They studied every mass shooting since 1966.

Here's four commonalities that they learned about the shooters.:
– Early childhood trauma and exposure to violence at an early age
– Reached an identifiable crisis point in weeks or months leading up to the shooting
– Access to actions, ideologies, and validation for their plans from other shooters
– Access to the means to carry out their plans. Can they obtain firearms?

### [The El Paso Shooting and the Gamification of Terror](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/americas/2019/08/04/the-el-paso-shooting-and-the-gamification-of-terror/)

After these mass shootings, we learn a lot about the massacres and the motivations that play into these events. As identified in the research shared above, one of the common threads in mass shootings is the dark spaces of the Internet people go to social, subscribe to these ideologies, and sometimes become radicalized.

On a seemingly regular basis in this newsletter I seem to find threads in which harmful discourses spread online. We may not want to peer deep into these areas, but I think that in order to be a responsible citizen of the web, we need to understand the good, and bad/horrible that is out there.

[Robert Evans](https://twitter.com/IwriteOK) reports on some of his investigations of far-right extremist groups in the US and the ways in which they radicalize and communicate through the Internet.

In this post, we documents the concept of _high scores_ on 8chan, where white nationalist terror has been gamified by lonely white men seeking identity and acclaim.

### ['Shut the Site Down,' Says the Creator of 8chan, a Megaphone for Gunmen](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/04/technology/8chan-shooting-manifesto.html)

[8chan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8chan) (also called Infinitechan or Infinitychan) is an imageboard website composed of user-created message boards. There is little to no interaction from site moderators or admins. 8chan picked up notoriety when the moderators at [4chan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4chan) (another English-language messageboard website) got serious and started banning users for illegal, or exceptionally disturbing content.

This post shares the story of [Frederick Brennan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fredrick_Brennan), the founder of 8chan. Brennan started the online message board as a free speech utopia. But now, 8chan is known as a megaphone for mass shooters, and a recruiting platform for violent white nationalists.

Not long after the recent round of massacres, [Cloudflare indicated](https://new.blog.cloudflare.com/terminating-service-for-8chan/) that they would no longer protect 8chan from attacks. Cloudflare is a web infrastructure and security company. Put simply, they protect websites when others try to shut them down. Not soon after these announcements, attacks starting coming to shut down 8chan. This has caused a number of members of 8chan to head elsewhere online. Please note, in an earlier issue of this newsletter, I detailed the use of Gab (and Mastodon support) to create a distributed space for these communities.

There is much more to talk about with this issue. I'll stay on top of the story and try to help explain it. Please note, this also raises important questions about freedom of speech, and the role/purpose of our online discourse systems.

### [Study: most people would rather lose a job to a robot than a human](https://bigthink.com/study-lose-job-robot-human)

Really interesting survey about human opinions about workforce automation.

Scientists in Germany find that most people would rather a robot replaced them in their job than a human. On the other hand, most people would be upset if a robot took the job of a colleague.

People have different emotional reactions to being replaced by robots versus humans. I really can't figure out the logic here. What do you think?

### [Scientists Just Discovered 39 'Invisible' Galaxies](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/gyzppw/scientists-just-discovered-39-invisible-galaxies)

A much needed bit of perspective.

Scientists have found a vast array of hidden galaxies, which together could change our understanding of how the universe works.

The mysterious galaxies, which were previously unknown to researchers, were discovered by a breakthrough new approach that allowed astronomers to look more deeply than ever before into the universe.

The astronomers describe the new find as a treasure trove, representing a huge set of galaxies. It could help solve some of the most deep and fundamental questions about the universe, including the mysteries of supermassive black holes and dark matter.

## 🔨 Do

### [How to Smize](https://www.wikihow.com/Smize)

This week was really stressful. Here is the US, we seem to be set at panic mode…for justifiable reasons.

When you go out in public the next time, look at people (yes, strangers as well) and smile first. Better yet, make it believable and smize.

Supposedly a smize, or _smiling with your eyes_ makes you look more genuine. If you smile first, many times this will be returned with a smile from a stranger. Who knows…it may make you feel better as well.

This week I was digging [Echoes of Japan](https://play.google.com/music/m/Bdvb2twy7ra5bu7d4lj3ysue7iq?t=Echoes_of_Japan__-_Minyo_Crusaders) from the Minyo Crusaders. [Minyo Crusaders](https://bacana.live/artist/minyo-crusaders/) reworks traditional Japanese folk songs (minyo) with Latin, African, and Caribbean rhythms.
