## Let's Keep It FRKE

**Published**: November 14, 2021 â€¢ [[03 CREATE/ðŸ“§ Newsletter/ðŸ“§ Newsletter\|ðŸ“§ Newsletter]]

Welcome back, everyone! Here's *Digitally Literate*, issue #311. Your go-to source for insightful content on education, technology, and the digital landscape.

This week, I shared insights and reflections on creativity in education and technology. A highlight was working on *[Towards a Taxonomy of Transdisciplinarity](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IN65TBvZU_VltL5z50nlNh8BW-S5zAW4pWbTZ2FZBYQ/edit#heading=h.yrrd3q61b4bq)*, a paper for the LRA 2021 Conference. This project explored how pre-service teachers can use transdisciplinary thinking to connect math and music through summer art camps.

## ðŸ”– Key Takeaways
- **Creativity Through Connection**: Building bridges between seemingly unrelated concepts (like spoons becoming musical instruments) creates profound learning experiences and human connections
- **Misinformation's Media Evolution**: COVID-19 misinformation spreads unchecked through podcasts and radio, highlighting the need for nuanced approaches to content moderation beyond traditional AI solutions
- **Assessment Innovation**: Digital multimodal composition requires new frameworks that evaluate audience engagement, mode effectiveness, and originality rather than traditional essay criteria
- **Grading Equity Focus**: Schools are abandoning traditional grading systems that exacerbate inequities, moving toward standards-based and alternative assessment approaches
- **Productive vs. Destructive Reflection**: Distinguishing between problem-solving reflection and unproductive rumination becomes crucial for mental health and forward progress

### [All About Spoons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wJo5aKBwq0)
You'd be forgiven for wondering, as an adult, why Mister Rogers carries a spoon. As detailed in a new book, [*When You Wonder, You're Learning: Mister Rogers' Enduring Lessons for Raising Creative, Curious, Caring Kids*](http://whenyouwonder.org/), the journey â€” from a simple Point A (a spoon) to a deeply human Point B â€” embodies the magic of *Mister Rogers' Neighborhood*.

The effect is that for children, spoons become more than passing intrigues. They become musical instruments, a spark for artistic expression, and even possible career paths. Most importantly, they become points of connection between kids and caring adults. As science has shown, the more of these connections kids have, the better they tend to do.

Building connections through creativity can have a profound impact on children's growth and curiosity.

### Are You Problem Solving or Ruminating?
As human beings, we have the capacity to reflect on our past behaviors. Unfortunately, there are many times in which going over the past becomes quite unproductive. [This Psychology Today post](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/sweet-emotion/201409/are-you-problem-solving-or-ruminating) discusses how we can know if we are engaging in adaptive self-reflection or maladaptive rumination.

Rumination is sometimes viewed as [a negative form of emotional processing](https://www.verywellmind.com/repetitive-thoughts-emotional-processing-or-rumination-3144936).

*The defining aspect of rumination that differentiates it from regular problem-solving is the unproductively negative focus it takes. Rumination may involve going over the details of a situation in one's head or talking to friends about it.*

As a general rule, the following can be indicators that you may have fallen into the trap of rumination:
- Focusing on a problem for more than a few idle minutes
- Feeling worse than you started out feeling
- No movement toward accepting and moving on
- No closer to a viable solution

### Listening is where love begins: listening to ourselves and then to our neighbors.
*Fred Rogers*

---

This profound insight from Mister Rogers connects beautifully with the themes explored throughout this issue. The spoon example demonstrates how listeningâ€”to children's curiosity, to their natural creativity, to their need for connectionâ€”transforms simple objects into profound learning experiences.

Assessment frameworks that evaluate multimodal compositions require educators to listen more carefully to diverse forms of student expression. Equitable grading practices demand that we listen to the ways traditional systems have failed marginalized students. Even distinguishing between productive reflection and harmful rumination requires listening to our own internal processes.

Rogers reminds us that in our rush to optimize, innovate, and solve problems, the foundational skill is learning to listenâ€”to ourselves, our students, our communities. This kind of deep listening creates the trust and understanding necessary for meaningful learning and growth.

### Newsletter Evolution Note
Issue #311 showcases Ian's ability to connect educational psychology (creativity and connection-building) with contemporary challenges (COVID misinformation, assessment innovation) and practical wisdom (FRKE philosophy, productive reflection). This synthesis demonstrates his growing sophistication in linking theoretical frameworks with real-world applications while maintaining focus on equity and human flourishing. The transdisciplinary research reference reflects his commitment to bridging academic work with newsletter insights.
