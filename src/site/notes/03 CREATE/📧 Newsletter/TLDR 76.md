** Too Long; Didn't Read (TL;DR) newsletter #76

------------------------------------------------------------

Welcome to issue 76 of the TL;DR Newsletter. In TL;DR we typically discuss events of the week in education, technology, and literacy. In this issue we take a look at intervening in situations.

This week I spent time closing out grades for the semester and revising a chapter on how to be a digitally agile researcher (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1J1cZOIhlPDlyr-iVPhDcopLDTIUw0CraBdumulWvr0k/edit?usp=sharing) . I also published this post (Slow is smooth. Smooth is fast. (http://wiobyrne.com/imho/2016/slow-is-smooth-smooth-is-fast) ) about focusing on the granular elements when learning something new.

## 📺 Watch

** How to fight the bad logic of the internet (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iN5Kkz5dEw)

This video is from ** a new video series from Wired called "Argument Clinic." (https://www.wired.com/2016/12/want-fight-online-bs-weve-got-crash-course/)

In this video they indicate elements from the ** presumption of innocence (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presumption_of_innocence)

to indicate that: Proof lies on he who asserts, not he who denies.

A very good reminder as we need to increasingly critical evaluate online content. I still think there is a need to make "facts louder than opinion" as we discussed last week in TL;DR.

## 📚 Read

Post from Heinemann Publishing detailing guidance for educators on teaching critical literacy in the classroom.

They indicate:

A students’ ability to read critically is essential for them to write critically. If they can develop an understanding of how informational texts are constructed, those critical skills will deepen as they create their own arguments through their writing. This requires a shift from identifying elements of informational texts to building with them. Writing argument supplements students’ reading of informational texts by illuminating the choices authors make surrounding audience, voice, genre, and the research used (or not used) to support their texts.

The post shares a series of three big questions ** originally shared by Kylene Beers and Bob Probst (http://www.heinemann.com/products/E05080.aspx)

:

* What surprised me?

* What did the author think that I already knew?

* What changed, challenged, or confirmed what I already knew?

** The National Education Technology Plan (http://tech.ed.gov/netp/)

The U.S. Department of Education released the 2016 plan, titled, Future Ready Learning: Reimagining the role of technology in education.

The plan details a vision of "equity, active use, and collaborative leadership to make everywhere, all-the-time learning possible."

I'm still in the process of digesting this plan. The website does a good job of breaking down the report into specific sections. To access ** the full report (PDF) click here (http://tech.ed.gov/files/2015/12/NETP16.pdf)

** Eight things you need to do right now to protect yourself online (https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/15/protect-passwords-two-step-verification-encryption-digital-life-privacy)

If you haven't seen it already, ** Yahoo was hacked (again) (https://bgr.com/2016/12/15/yahoo-mail-security-breach/)

. This is the second time in six months that they disclosed breaches of your data. The key thing to remember is that they knew about these hacks years ago. They only now are sharing this with the public.

In a related note, Evernote changed their terms of service and are ** building in opportunities for their employees to read your content (https://lifehacker.com/evernote-employees-can-read-your-notes-and-theres-no-w-1790099958)

(if needed).  I'm in the process of changing my note taking system over to something new.

As we consider the products and platforms we use, we need to be more vigilant about our own privacy & security in online spaces. This primer from The Guardian gives a good overview of how to get started. I'll have a series of granular posts coming out as I implement these steps.

** Should you intervene in a bias attack? (https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/should-you-intervene-in-a-bias-attack/)

Increasingly we are seeing more violence in society. A lot of this violence is also happening in our schools and on college campuses.

In the past, I've discussed our need to be aware of situations in which an active shooter may be present. With this influx of "bias attacks" and "hate crimes" I think it is also important that we examine what to do when a situation like this arises. As with active shooters...I think the first step is being aware that these situations are a case of WHEN (not IF) they will happen. When they do occur...you can hopefully act and not freeze.

This post from Scientific American discusses the complex calculus that occurs as we are a bystander to these events. I recommend reading through their prompts in case they are needed.

** Hypothesis introduces updated search and profiles (https://hypothes.is/blog/introducing-search-and-profiles/)

One of my favorite tools to use in classes to have students read and collaborate. Imagine having students collaboratively read, annotate, and discuss using text on a website as opposed to each person reading on their own. ** Hypothesis (https://hypothes.is/)

allows you to collaboratively create an annotated layer on the internet.

You can read more about ** how I use Hypothesis here (http://wiobyrne.com/using-hypothes-is/)

.

In this latest update, Hypothesis improves the search function allowing a better look at notes, tags, usernames, etc. I'm most excited by the improvements to the profiles pages in the system. Now I can annotate and markup online content for use in later research. I can also review the individual annotations by students as they read online.

I'll be spending a lot more time with Hypothesis in the future.

## 🔨 Do

How to take decent pictures of the sky at night

I've been spending more time working with my various photo and video cameras. One challenge that I've had recently is taking photos of the sky. We've had two "super moons" here over the past six months. We also recently had some incredible cloud structures at dusk that I wanted to capture. As big and beautiful as these things seemed...the photos never came out.

This post from Lifehacker goes through some of the specifics of making this happen.

* Start with the right equipment - An interchangeable lens camera, tripod, timer to make sure you don't rock the camera when you take the picture.

* Find the best environment - Light pollution, weather, and sky conditions all impact your ability to take clear shots.

* Pick the right camera settings - Select RAW images if available. Use manual settings instead of autofocus.

+ Aperture: How wide your lens opens to allow light to come in. This is measured in f-stops. Use f/2.8.

+ Shutter Speed: Your camera’s shutter speed determines how long your camera’s sensor will be open to let in the light. The faster the shutter opens and closes, the less light it allows. Use 25 seconds.

+ ISO Speed: How sensitive your camera’s sensor is to incoming light. The higher the ISO, the more sensitive it’ll be to light. Use 1600.

The post shares a bit more info, but these elements should help us get out there and challenge ourselves to grab that great shot. :)
