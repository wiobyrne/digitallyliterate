Welcome back. I hope you're taking time for self-care.

This week I posted the following:

- [Digital Literacy: Developing Critical Thinking](https://wiobyrne.com/digital-literacy-developing-critical-thinking/) - I presented at the 2021 Wisconsin Literacy Research Symposium. Here are my materials, notes, and reflections.
- [Pre-Service Educators Developing a Digital Identity](https://wiobyrne.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Pre-Service-Educators-Developing-a-Digital-Identity.pdf) - Finally published! This article discusses preservice education students implementing digital identities through self-constructed websites.
- [Consume. Curate. Create.](https://wiobyrne.com/consume-curate-create/) - A continuum of three stages moving learners from consumers to producers of digital content.
- [Dispositions of Computational Thinking Instrument](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ovPXiDnnQ7ikVSsb4DofQuezAdV_cZ0OMFef8EESSHE/edit) - We're developing an instrument to identify and define learner dispositions impacting computational thinking education.

### [Why Teaching in America Is Uniquely Tough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teaching-america)

Teachers in America have a uniquely tough job. But it doesn't have to be that way.

From hours worked to pay rates, countries like Finland, Japan, and South Korea make teaching a more respected and sustainable profession. The comparison reveals what's possible when societies actually value educators.

### [Big Tech Antitrust Legislation Advances](https://apnews.com/article/google-antitrust-lawsuit-europe-tips-9b100e96d23849b742d27c457157b6bc)

Europe has been [harder on giant tech companies](https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/what-can-america-learn-from-europe-about-regulating-big-tech) than the U.S.—but perhaps that's changing.

The U.S. Judiciary Committee voted this week to advance five bills addressing the dominance of Amazon, Apple, Google, and Facebook.

Democrats and Republicans don't agree on much these days, but [many seem to agree on this](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/24/-big-tech-antitrust-debate-odd-alliances-form-and-party-fractures-show.html).

### [Cancel Amazon Prime](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/06/amazon-prime-day-dystopian/619265/)

This week was Prime Day, Amazon's global shopping event. Prime is Amazon's $119-a-year membership service with free one-day shipping, streaming media, Whole Foods discounts, and other perks.

[Ellen Cushing](https://twitter.com/elcush) suggests that if you want to do something about Big Tech and its growing power, you should cancel your Amazon Prime account.

The most direct consumer action is to stop being a consumer.

### [No Cure: Techno-Solutionism's Dead End](https://www.publicbooks.org/no-cure/)

[Hannah Zeavin](https://www.zeavin.org/) on cures and our desire for techno-cures that will fix all that ails us:

> "Inescapably, then, techno-cures are a dead end. The presenting complaint and the resulting cure are each a symptom of larger societal forces at work; if we can identify who is understood to be in need of a cure, who is worthy of it, and who receives it, we can follow each one to diagnose the system in which they occur."

Technology can't cure problems that are fundamentally social and political.

### [Teaching Kids Social Responsibility Reduces Bullying](https://theconversation.com/teaching-kids-social-responsibility-like-how-to-settle-fights-and-ask-for-help-can-reduce-school-bullying-158493)

[Research](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/01650254211020133) from [Jonathan B. Santo](https://theconversation.com/profiles/jonathan-b-santo-1220232) and [Josafa da Cunha](https://theconversation.com/profiles/josafa-da-cunha-1223289) suggests schools that encourage students to care for classmates' feelings and peacefully resolve conflicts can lower incidents of bullying.

The skills are teachable. The effects are measurable.

### [The Internet Eats Up Less Energy Than You Might Think](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/24/technology/computer-energy-use-study.html)

A [new analysis](https://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(21)00211-7) by [Jonathan Koomey](https://www.koomey.com/about.html) and [Eric Masanet](https://bren.ucsb.edu/people/eric-masanet) suggests some dire warnings of environmental damage from technology are overstated.

Giant tech companies and their power-hungry, football-field-size data centers are not the environmental villains they're sometimes portrayed to be on social media.

### [Build Your Own Lightboard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lightboard-diy)

I've played with a Lightboard like this in the past—it's awesome for creating instructional videos where you write on transparent surface while facing the camera.

If you'd like to make your own, here's how. A weekend project that opens up new possibilities for teaching.

## 🤔 Consider

### It is not that we have a short time to live, but that we waste a lot of it.

*Seneca*

Seneca's observation about time connects to this issue's threads—the techno-cures that distract from real solutions, the subscription services that claim to save time while demanding attention, and the teaching profession that wastes human potential through lack of support. The question isn't how much time we have, but how we use it.
