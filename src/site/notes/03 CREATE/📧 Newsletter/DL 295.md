Welcome back. I hope you're taking time for self-care.

This week I posted the following:

- [*Digital Literacy: Developing Critical Thinking*](https://wiobyrne.com/digital-literacy-developing-critical-thinking/) \- I presented at the 2021 Wisconsin Literacy Research Symposium this week. Here are my materials, notes, and reflections. 
- [*Pre-Service Educators Developing a Digital Identity*](https://wiobyrne.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Pre-Service-Educators-Developing-a-Digital-Identity.pdf) \- Really excited this is finally published. This article discusses a study on preservice education students and the implementation of digital identities through self-constructed websites in a technology course.
- [*Consume. Curate. Create.*](https://wiobyrne.com/consume-curate-create/) \- In the pub linked above, I discuss a continuum of three stages that move learners from consumers to producers of digital content. This blog post presents that info in a different format. 
- [*Dispositions of Computational Thinking Instrument Content Expert Validation.*](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ovPXiDnnQ7ikVSsb4DofQuezAdV_cZ0OMFef8EESSHE/edit) \- We've been developing an instrument to identify & define the learner dispositions that impact computational thinking education. Here is the public content validation form we sent out to experts for review.

Teachers in America have a uniquely tough job. But it doesn't have to be that way. 

From hours worked to pay rates, countries like Finland, Japan, and South Korea make teaching a more respected and sustainable profession.

The U.S. Judiciary Committee voted this week to advance five bills that would address the dominance of companies like Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook.

## [Cancel Amazon Prime](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/06/amazon-prime-day-dystopian/619265/)

This week was Prime Day, a global shopping event provided by Amazon for their Prime members. Prime is Amazon's $119-a-year membership service, which buys subscribers free one-day shipping, plus access to streaming media, discounts at the Amazon subsidiary Whole Foods, and a host of other perks. 

In this post, [Ellen Cushing](https://twitter.com/elcush) suggests that if you want to do something about Big Tech and its growing power...you should cancel your Amazon Prime account.

[Hannah Zeavin](https://www.zeavin.org/) on cures, and our desires to have techno-cures that will fix all that ails us. 

*"Inescapably, then, techno-cures are a dead end. The presenting complaint and the resulting cure are each a symptom of larger societal forces at work; if we can identify who is understood to be in need of a cure, who is worthy of it, and who receives it, we can follow each one to diagnose the system in which they occur. Once a diagnosis has been made, remedy may be sought. And at the ready, ever to hand, techno-optimism, and its kin, techno-solutionism, present us with a myriad of cures."*

The piece suggests that the giant tech companies and their power-hungry, football-field-size data centers are not the environmental villains they are sometimes portrayed to be on social media and elsewhere.
