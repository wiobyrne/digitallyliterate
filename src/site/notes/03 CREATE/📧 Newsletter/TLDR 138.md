# TLDR 138

## Too Long; Didn't Read Issue 138

**Published**: 2018-02-24 • [[03 CREATE/📧 Newsletter/📧 Newsletter\|📧 Newsletter]]

Welcome to Issue #138. The kids are going to be alright.

Over the past week, I've been thinking a lot about the work I present each week in this newsletter. Good friend Bill Kist reached out and suggested that I consolidated much of my digging into this mixture of algorithms, bots, and trolls into a publication to make it easier to follow. I brought some of these ideas to an address I gave yesterday at the South Carolina International Reading Association Conference. I'm also going to flesh out more of these ideas in an upcoming keynote at the Virginia State Reading Association Conference. I'm hoping to sound the alarm about the challenges of being literate in current times. Dear readers of TL;DR, you've been following me as I try to make sense of all of these elements. I am thankful for your support and feedback.

This week I posted the following:
- [TLT Survey in French](http://digitallyliterate.net/tltsurvey-french/) - As part of the [Digitally Literate Research Project](http://digitallyliterate.net/), we're surveying the globe to better understand the ways in which educators integrate digital technologies in instruction. Please share in global audiences.
- ["Tell me about yourself" in a critical auto-ethnography](http://wiobyrne.com/critical-autoethnography/) - In this post I share my guidance on a research and writing project I have students complete in my language and literacy courses.

## 🔖 Key Takeaways

- **Sunday Routine Productivity**: The YouTube channel The Financial Diet usually offers financial advice. In this video, host Chelsea Fagan talks through the Sunday routine that's helped her become more productive despite her naturally lazy, type-B personality.
- **Young Adults Don't Care**: What is terribly fascinating is that these young adults don't care. They're not being silenced. They're not afraid. And...they're using the very same digital texts and tools to push back.
- **Let Teachers Teach**: Instead of talking about common sense gun reforms, politicians and lobbyists are trotting out a series of (stupid) possible solutions. Kevin Hodgson explains why this idea is equally as insane.
- **Excellent Overview Everything**: This piece by the Southern Poverty Law Center gives an excellent overview of everything you need to know about this entity. The Internet Research Agency was one of the groups that used Facebook's own tools to make sure their propaganda was as effective as possible.
- **Resist With Better Information**: We resist not only with better information, and better interpretation, but in recovering the language of the internet — the language of (digital) scholarship. Kris Shaffer indicates that perhaps our research and pedagogy should focus on the simple vehicle that connects the informational space...the hyperlink.
- **Liking Subject Helps Brain**: The research suggests that not only do children like subjects they're good at, but "liking" a subject helps students' brain actually work better. The hippocampus, a brain area linked with memory and learning, was significantly more active in kids with a positive attitude towards math.

## 📚 Read

### [The Pro-Trump media has met its match in the Parkland students](https://www.buzzfeed.com/charliewarzel/parkland-school-shooting-survivors-crisis-actors-pro-trump?utm_term=.npW1xA8KDM#.qmPmkgNvMo)

Last week in [TL;DR #137](https://us11.campaign-archive.com/?u=7b5ee323a16720dad25ff96ff&id=e53c30b8b1) we spent a lot of time talking about bots, trolls, and propaganda. Much of this was centered around the survivors of the Parkland Shooting in Florida. These young adults were speaking out online and on the media against the lobbyists and politicians that are advancing pro-gun initiatives.

As a response to their protests, a [network of bots, trolls, & media](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/19/technology/russian-bots-school-shooting.html) are [pushing to label youth](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/20/business/media/parkland-shooting-media-conspiracy.html) "not as grief-ridden survivors but as pawns & conspiracists intent on exploiting a tragedy to undermine the nation's laws."

What is terribly fascinating is that these young adults don't care. They're not being silenced. They're not afraid. And...they're using the very same digital texts and tools to push back. I usually throw out discussions about "digital natives", but I think we're seeing this interesting thread where these students know the system is broken...and they're using it to their advantage.

Once again...we need to learn from the children. We need to amplify their voices.

### [Let the teachers teach](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/22/opinion/teachers-guns-classrooms.html)

There has been a lot of talk, but not a lot of action, following the Parkland Shooting over the past week.

Across the country, [teachers are grappling with how their roles have expanded](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/19/us/teachers-school-shootings.html), from educator & counselor to bodyguard & protector. Little by little, [the teaching profession changes](https://www.npr.org/2018/02/22/588069918/how-school-shootings-have-changed-the-teaching-profession) as educators come to terms with the impact on our classrooms. Along with the students...teachers have once again been [shown to be heroes](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/opinion-vilson-teachers-shootings_us_5a870d6fe4b05c2bcaca6c8a).

Instead of talking about common sense gun reforms, politicians and lobbyists are trotting out a series of (stupid) possible solutions. The National Rifle Association (NRA) touts a plan to ["harden" school campuses](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/02/the-nras-plan-to-harden-schools-is-terrifying/) that would turn schools into prisons. There is also a discussion about arming teachers to allow them to engage school shooters. [Kevin Hodgson](https://twitter.com/dogtrax) explains why [this idea is equally as insane](http://dogtrax.edublogs.org/2018/02/22/the-arming-of-teachers-are-you-insane/).

I'll close with the last sentence of [the piece above](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/22/opinion/teachers-guns-classrooms.html) from the NY Times Editorial Board:

> In fact, sensible gun laws would give people, especially children, a better chance to enjoy the first of the inalienable rights mentioned in the Declaration of Independence: life.

### [The Internet Research Agency: behind the shadowy network that meddled in the 2016 elections](https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2018/02/21/internet-research-agency-behind-shadowy-network-meddled-2016-elections)

Over the past couple of weeks, I'm now more direct in my assessment that our social networks and tools have been weaponized against us.

One of the groups that has been actively conducting this work is the Internet Research Agency. This piece by the [Southern Poverty Law Center](https://www.splcenter.org/) gives an excellent overview of everything you need to know about this entity.

The Internet Research Agency was one of the groups that [used Facebook's own tools](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/17/technology/indictment-russian-tech-facebook.html) to make sure their propaganda was as effective as possible. This may have [not been that sophisticated](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/02/the-russian-conspiracy-to-commit-audience-development/553685/), but it made a huge impact.

### [Education in the (dis)information age](http://hybridpedagogy.org/education-disinformation/)

A great piece in [Hybrid Pedagogy](http://hybridpedagogy.org/) by [Kris Shaffer](https://twitter.com/krisshaffer) unpacking the current challenges in teaching and learning in the current climate. Shaffer's analysis is super smart, and super simple.

Kris indicates that perhaps our research and pedagogy should focus on the simple vehicle that connects the informational space...the hyperlink.

In the post, he drills down into the minutiae of examining this ubiquitous piece of underlined text. I suggest taking some time to read and drink it in. Kris posits that "we resist not only with better information, and better interpretation, but in recovering the language of the internet — the language of (digital) scholarship."

### [A positive attitude literally makes your brain work better](https://www.inc.com/jessica-stillman/stanford-research-attitude-matters-as-much-as-iq-in-kids-success.html)

New brain scan research from Stanford reveals the ways in which positivity affects the brain.

The Stanford research team analyzed the math skills and attitudes of 240 kids aged seven to ten, as well as running 47 of them through an fMRI machine while asking them to do some basic arithmetic.

Results suggest that kids who did well in math liked math more, both according to self reports and their parents, and kids who hated the subject did poorly. The brain scans also turned up something much more fascinating. The images revealed that the hippocampus, a brain area linked with memory and learning, was significantly more active in kids with a positive attitude towards math.

The research suggests that not only do children like subjects they're good at, but "liking" a subject helps students' brain actually work better.

### [Announce why you're looking at your phone](http://www.freetech4teachers.com/2018/01/how-to-add-voice-comments-to-google-docs.html#.Wms-3ZM-fUI)

Screentime has been a big focus in my circles over the last couple of months. I'll have more on this over the coming weeks.

This post contains guidance from the [TiLT Parenting Podcast](http://www.tiltparenting.com/2018/02/13/episode-95-writer-anya-kamenetz-on-the-art-of-screen-time/), Anya Kamenetz, NPR's lead education blogger and author of the new book [The Art of Screen Time: How Your Family Can Balance Digital Media and Real Life](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Screen-Time-Balance-Digital/dp/1610396723?tag=lifehackeramzn-20&ascsubtag=018f78e1733bf63007d58a3f3be2a64f99fba38f&rawdata=%5Br%7Chttps%3A%2F%2Fpinboard.in%2Fu%3Awiobyrne%5Bt%7Clink%5Bp%7C1823194762%5Ba%7C1610396723%5Bau%7C5876237249237145597%5Bb%7Clifehacker). She gives this tip for parents who want to be more conscious about looking at their phones in front of their kids. Specifically she notes that you should announce why you're looking at your phone in that moment.

I'm going to try this out over the coming month to see what impact it may have. I believe it'll make me self-conscious and not want to always check my news feeds. Perhaps...that is the reason.
