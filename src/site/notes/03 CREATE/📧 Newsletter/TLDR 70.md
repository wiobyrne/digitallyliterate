# TLDR 70

## Too Long; Didn't Read Issue 70

**Published**: 2016-11-04 • [[03 CREATE/📧 Newsletter/📧 Newsletter\|📧 Newsletter]]

Welcome to issue 70 of the TL;DR Newsletter. In TL;DR I'm synthesizing what I read and learned this week in literacy, technology, and education. Ciao.

This week we think through the basics of communication.

Please [subscribe](http://wiobyrne.us11.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=7b5ee323a16720dad25ff96ff&id=17e92a2ae1) to make sure you don't miss out on the upcoming goodness. You can review [archives of the newsletter](http://us11.campaign-archive1.com/home/?u=7b5ee323a16720dad25ff96ff&id=17e92a2ae1). Check out TL;DR on [Medium](https://medium.com/tldr-newsletter) & [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wiobyrne?trk=nav_responsive_tab_profile).

You can also follow along on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/wiobyrne/) and [Snapchat](https://www.snapchat.com/add/wiobyrne). I added my Snapcode to the footer of this newsletter. Send me your responses and questions there if you'd like to continue the dialogue.

This week I worked on the following:

- [Becoming digitally literate in a domain of one's own](http://wiobyrne.com/domain-of-ones-own/) - This post is a continuation of my thinking/discussion about a domain of one's own (#DoOO). It also contains the latest working draft of our column for JAAL that should be out soon. I wanted to share it now to continue the discussion.
- [A grant proposal for the ELATED Project](http://wiobyrne.com/project-elated-proposal/) - I applied for an "Improving Teacher Quality" grant here in SC with a group of colleagues. In order to strive for transparency in my work I'm sharing most of our proposal materials.
- [Three steps to move students from readers to writers of digital content](http://wiobyrne.com/writers-of-digital-content/) - This week a column I wrote for [Literacy Today](http://wiobyrne.com/imho/2016/scaffolding-digital-creation-column-in-literacy-today) was published. In this I extend my earlier thinking about digitally agile educators to the student level.

Finally, if you're interested in some new art for your laptop, support [Bryan Mathers on Indiegogo](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/visual-stickery-laptop-art--2#/) to lock up some tattoos for your machines. I backed his campaign this week as Bryan is a good friend and mentor for me in these spaces.

## 🔖 Key Takeaways

- **I've Been Having Discussions**: This video relates to recent political events here in the U.S. It also connects with our recent discussions here in TL;DR about online trolling and (conversely) stoicism. More importantly, I've been having discussions with my son about bullying and temper tantrums that he is seeing from other kids in his circles.
- **The Sci-Fi Fan in Me**: Alice and Bob were able to invent their own encryption scheme that Eve wasn't able to figure out. Even better...the Google Brain team is still trying to figure out exactly what Alice and Bob created. Some will suggest this is an important event in which "the machines are talking and we cannot figure it out." The sci-fi fan in me would love this logic.
- **I'm Thinking Twice About**: Plain black text on bright white pages is really hard to read. Additionally, mixing in shades of grey for text on primarily white pages is equally as tough. I'm beginning to think about this as I choose fonts, themes, and backgrounds for my websites. I'm thinking twice about my recent trend toward minimalism.
- **This Is Why I Blog**: Bonnie notes, "Blogging is a choral act. Posts are commented on; ties are formed. Stories and backstories become known." This is why I blog. This is also why I need to reach out and respond to others via my blog to make these connections.

## 📺 Watch

### [Why are people so nasty?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qjy-ydl9QE)

A great video from the [School of Life YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7IcJI8PUf5Z3zKxnZvTBog) channel this week. This video relates to recent political events here in the U.S. It also connects with our recent discussions here in TL;DR about online trolling and (conversely) stoicism. More importantly, I've been having discussions with my son about bullying and temper tantrums that he is seeing from other kids in his circles.

## 📚 Read

### [Google AI invents its own cryptographic algorithm; no one knows how it works](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06918)

This post came up last week, but it's been reverberating online in my social circles and I wanted to make sure you saw it.

The Google Brain team created three [neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network) (connected networks of computer nodes that simulate the brain) named Alice, Bob, and Eve. The individual networks were not taught how to encrypt their networks. Alice was instructed to send a message to Bob; Bob had to decrypt it; Eve had to eavesdrop and decode the message. The only other major variable is that Alice and Bob shared a secret key needed to decrypt the message.

In short, Alice and Bob were able to invent their own encryption scheme that Eve wasn't able to figure out. Even better...the Google Brain team is still trying to figure out exactly what Alice and Bob created. They don't understand the system.

Some will suggest this is an important event in which "the machines are talking and we cannot figure it out." The sci-fi fan in me would love this logic. I also see the counter argument that there are many times that our computers talk and we (human ears) cannot understand it. Take for example the hiss and crackle of a modem or fax machine.

An interesting event to keep an eye on.

### [How the web became unreadable](https://backchannel.com/how-the-web-became-unreadable-a781ddc711b6#.jza001bvi)

Post from [Kevin Marks](https://twitter.com/kevinmarks) documenting how typography is increasingly becoming more and more difficult to read. He begins the post with the documentation of how Google App Engine has moved from [legible](https://kevinmarks.github.io/appenginebefore.png) to [illegible](https://kevinmarks.github.io/appengineafter.png) typography. He continues on with an examination of contrast ratios as detailed in the image above, and the prevalence of these ratios across the web.

In short, plain black text on bright white pages is really hard to read. Additionally, mixing in shades of grey for text on primarily white pages is equally as tough. I'm beginning to think about this as I choose fonts, themes, and backgrounds for my websites. I'm thinking twice about my recent trend toward minimalism.

On another note...turn down the brightness of your screens. You should install [f.lux](https://justgetflux.com/) on your devices as well.

### [Blogging is a choral act](http://www.digitalpedagogylab.com/hybridped/blogging-is-a-choral-act/)

Post from [Bonnie Stewart](https://twitter.com/bonstewart) republished as part of Digital Writing Month. This post focuses on the connections, art, and social practices involved in blogging.

Bonnie notes:

> Blogging is a choral act. Posts are commented on; ties are formed. Stories and backstories become known. As I connected with other bloggers and found community first with other parents and then with those whose writing, like my own, unpacked identities in various forms, I stumbled into something extraordinary: a space wherein I was able, in small ways, to publicly mother a child who was not here.

This is why I blog. This is also why I need to reach out and respond to others via my blog to make these connections.

### [Web pioneer tries to incubate a second digital revolution](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/602731/web-pioneer-tries-to-incubate-a-second-digital-revolution/)

In my work with BadgeChain, I've been researching blockchain and distributed ledger technologies for about a year now. In this I had the opportunity to speak a bit with [Brian Behlendorf](https://twitter.com/brianbehlendorf) about the future of the internet. These ideas are now fleshing out in the Hyperledger Project. I'll reshare the interview I conducted with Brian soon as I relaunch my podcast.

In the work with Hyperledger, they're currently moving in on health care by striving to become the "plumbing" in the system through the use of the blockchain.

The piece defines the blockchain as:

> A blockchain is a digital ledger that records transactions or other data over time. But records in a blockchain can be made effectively indelible using cryptography, and a blockchain can be designed to be operated by a group of companies or individuals together such that no single entity controls the system or its data.

The [Institute of Educational Sciences](https://ies.ed.gov/) (IES) is a leading source for rigorous, independent research, evaluation and statistics. They have been retooling their [What Works Clearinghouse](http://ies.ed.gov/ncee/wwc/FWW) and you should spend some time playing in [the search tool](http://ies.ed.gov/ncee/wwc/Product#/ContentTypeId:3,SortBy:RevisedDate,SetNumber:1).

You'll find a series of intervention reports and practice guides for educators to help you consider pedagogical opportunities.

My recent downloads include the following:

- [Teaching elementary school students to be effective writers](http://ies.ed.gov/ncee/wwc/Product#/ContentTypeId:3,SortBy:RevisedDate,SetNumber:1)

## 🔨 Do

### [Create MadLibs through Google Sheets](http://www.freetech4teachers.com/2016/11/create-madlibs-through-google-sheets.html#.WByPreErLdR)

Richard Byrne shares the possible use of one of my favorite tools (Google Sheets) and templates from [Flippity](http://www.flippity.net/). Within Flippity, you can review a series of templates for a variety of tasks, ranging from flashcards to quiz shows, and badge trackers. The [MadLibs template](http://www.flippity.net/MadLibs.asp) looks like a lot of fun that I'll fold in to an upcoming class.
