Welcome back to Digitally Literate.

We're making changes here at DL. First off, I reopened the [blog feed for the site](https://digitallyliterate.net/). That means that you can just scroll down from the homepage and see all of the issues.

Second, I'm building up an open, online course as part of DL. I'll have more info coming soon, but [here's a sneak peek](https://digitallyliterate.net/educator/) of the first wave of learning events. This is for the educator in Pre-K up through higher ed that wants to be digitally literate in terms of teaching, learning, & assessment. Enjoy. :)

This week I worked on the following:

- *[On Living Well](https://wiobyrne.com/on-living-well/)* - What does living well look like for you? What are you living for?
- *[Our Experience with COVID-19 Tests](https://wiobyrne.com/our-experience-with-covid-19-tests/)* - I document our experiences with coronavirus testing over the last couple of months.
- *[Are You on Offense or Defense?](https://wiobyrne.com/offense-or-defense/)* - A post about your level of control as you determine what your goals are and how will your spend your time to achieve them.
- *[Stop Waiting for "What's Next"](https://wiobyrne.com/stop-waiting-for-whats-next/)* - Stop waiting for *some day*…and think about *today*.
- *[Pause & Reboot](https://wiobyrne.com/pause-reboot/)* - Take time to stop and reboot your brain so you can start fresh each day.

If you haven't already, please [subscribe](https://digitallyliterate.net/subscribe/) if you would like this newsletter to show up in your inbox. Feel free to reach out and let me know what you think of this work at [hello@digitallyliterate.net](mailto:hello@digitallyliterate.net).

### [We Need to Talk About Talking About QAnon](https://www.wired.com/story/we-need-to-talk-about-talking-about-qanon/)

For those of you that do not spend their time deep in the [online wormhole of conspiracy and misinformation threads](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/janelytvynenko/qanon-families-friends), you may not know about QAnon. [QAnon](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/men-qanon/story?id=73046374) is a far-right conspiracy theory alleging that a cabal of Satan-worshiping pedophiles running a global child sex-trafficking ring is plotting against President Donald Trump, who is battling them, leading to a "day of reckoning" involving the mass arrest of journalists and politicians.

[Whitney Phillips](https://twitter.com/wphillips49) on how we need to talk about how a person's existing worldview feeds into & is fed by recommendation algorithms. This is how the attention economy has has become possible, profitable & untouchable.

QAnon seems to be [rebranding](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/qanon-leaders-look-rebrand-after-tech-crack-downs-n1241125) as they get more attention.

### [Telling the Truth About Slavery Is Not 'Indoctrination'](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/09/real-stakes-fight-over-history/616455/)

[Clint Smith](https://www.clintsmithiii.com/) on how our country is made better, not worse, by young people reckoning with the full legacy of the institution.

> Such reckoning better prepares them to make sense of how our country has come to be, and how to build systems and institutions predicated on justice rather than oppression. Nothing is more patriotic than that.

### [Whose Anger Counts?](https://bostonreview.net/gender-sexuality/whitney-phillips-whose-anger-counts)

[Whitney Phillips](https://twitter.com/wphillips49) on how cancel culture can go wrong. But that doesn't mean the objections of far-right trolls and social justice activists should be mistaken for having equal worth.

> If you truly want to do something about cancel culture, take the radical step of doing what you do for everyone else. See them.

### [Raising Good Gamers: Envisioning an Agenda for Diversity, Inclusion, and Fair Play](https://clalliance.org/publications/raising-good-gamers-envisioning-an-agenda-for-diversity-inclusion-and-fair-play/)

In February 2020, leading researchers, game developers, educators, policymakers, youth experts, and others convened for an in-depth exploration of the forces shaping the culture and climate of online game communities and the impact of antisocial and toxic interactions on players ages 8-13.

[This report](https://clalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Raising-Good-Gamers-Envisioning-an-Agenda-for-Diversity-Inclusion-and-Fair-Play.pdf) from the Connected Learning Alliance synthesizes outputs and recommendations focused on the following prompts:

- How might we develop and support gaming communities that cultivate empathetic, compassionate, and civically engaged youth?
- What might it look like to develop youth's socio-emotional capacities to positively shape the climate of gaming clubs and communities?
- What role can the design of games, gaming communities, and associated technologies play in mitigating abuse?
- How do we build the foundations of a healthy community directly into the platforms and communities themselves?

**Connected concepts**:
- [[Imposter Syndrome and Educational Justice\|Imposter Syndrome and Educational Justice]] - Dena Simmons' call for classrooms guaranteeing "safety to learn in the comfort of one's own skin" challenges deficit narratives about students of color. Imposter syndrome isn't an individual pathology but a rational response to institutional environments that signal certain students don't belong. This connects to broader questions about whether diversity initiatives address structural exclusion or merely help marginalized students better navigate hostile spaces.
- [[QAnon Algorithmic Radicalization Feedback Loop\|QAnon Algorithmic Radicalization Feedback Loop]] - Whitney Phillips identifies the core mechanism: existing worldview feeds into recommendation algorithms which feed back confirming content, creating profitable radicalization cycles. QAnon's rebranding after deplatforming shows the conspiracy adapts faster than platforms can respond. This connects to fundamental questions about whether algorithmic recommendation systems can be reformed or whether the attention economy's profit structure makes radicalization inevitable.
- [[Cancel Culture's False Equivalence\|Cancel Culture's False Equivalence]] - Phillips' question "whose anger counts?" exposes how both-sides framing treats far-right troll objections and social justice criticism as equally valid. The solution—"see them"—means recognizing context, history, and power rather than treating all complaints as equivalent. This connects to media literacy challenges when "teaching both sides" creates false balance between legitimate grievances and bad-faith attacks.
