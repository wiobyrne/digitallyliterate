# TLDR 113

## Too Long; Didn't Read Issue 113

**Published**: 2017-09-02 • [[03 CREATE/📧 Newsletter/📧 Newsletter\|📧 Newsletter]]

Welcome to issue 113 of TLDR. First things first, let the mindset flow.

This week I shared the following:
- [Video - Using Trello to Organize your projects, goals, and tasks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEDTMMSBEg0&t=2s)
- [Video - Using the Pomodoro Technique & Trello to get things done](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3mQpXa-9BU&t=3s)

## 🔖 Key Takeaways

- **Art Supports Creative Side**: Very cool video of Jim Carrey and his exploration of painting as a way to continue to explore his creative side. A fantastic way to reboot your creative side...or support those around you that need that artist side supported.
- **Google Uses Power to Quash**: As we examine these new digital tools and spaces, it's important to pay attention to the money, power, and leverage these companies have.
- **Horizon Report Calibrates Understanding**: I use these reports to help calibrate my understanding and expectations for tech use in education.
- **Empowering Critical Citizens**: I'm thinking about the need to empower our students (from Pre-K up through higher ed) as informed, critical citizens.
- **Internal Self-Awareness Instead**: Rather than balance, we should strive for what psychologists call internal self-awareness, or the ability to see yourself clearly by assessing, monitoring and proactively managing your core values, emotions, passions, behaviors and impact on others.
- **Reflection Is Fundamental**: Reflection was a fundamental element as a K12 teacher...and it's possibly more important now that I'm teaching teachers.
- **Read Smarter Not More**: We don't need to read more...just read smarter. Have a purpose, see yourself as a teacher, highlight and make mental connections, visualize and imagine, immediately apply one piece of new knowledge.

### [Google-funded think tank fired Google critics after they dared criticize Google](https://theintercept.com/2017/08/30/google-funded-think-tank-fired-google-critics-after-they-dared-criticize-google/)

[The New America Foundation](https://www.newamerica.org/), a digitally savvy center-left think tank routinely researches and critiques topics in public policy, including national security studies, technology, asset building, health, gender, energy, education, and the economy. New America has received more than $20 million in funding Alphabet (the parent company behind Google) since being founded in 1999. I definitely recommend signing up the Education alerts from New America if you don't already.

After Google was hit with a 2.42 billion–euro fine by the European Commission in June, one of New America's scholars, Barry Lynn posted [a congratulatory note to the regulators](https://www.newamerica.org/open-markets/press-releases/open-markets-applauds-european-commissions-finding-against-google-abuse-dominance/) and a call for action by American anti-trust officials. Not long after that post, New America president, Anne-Marie Slaughter, informed Lynn that he and his research team would no longer be welcome at the think tank, "presenting about as tidy and flagrant a case of conflict of interest and monied suppression of criticism as one can imagine."

There are a lot of moving parts to this story. You can read more [here at Vox](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/8/30/16226616/barry-lynn-google-new-america), and [the NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/30/us/politics/eric-schmidt-google-new-america.html). I also thoroughly recommend reading [this piece](http://gizmodo.com/yes-google-uses-its-power-to-quash-ideas-it-doesn-t-li-1798646437) by [Kashmir Hill](https://twitter.com/kashhill) about Google killing/burying stories in the past.

As we examine these new digital tools and spaces, it's important to pay attention to the money, power, and leverage these companies have.

### [2017 K-12 Horizon Report](http://www.nmc.org/publication/nmccosn-horizon-report-2017-k-12-edition/)

Each year the New Media Consortium (this year in a partnership with the Consortium for School Networking) puts together a report on the trends and change that will frame segments of education over the coming year. I use these reports to help calibrate my understanding and expectations for tech use in education.

This year they include an awesome [project dashboard](https://www.nmc.org/nmc-horizon-project/?nmc_project_id=263210&pane=pane_project_dashboard) that includes expert feedback on a series of research questions from the report. The [Digital Toolkit](http://2017-nmc-cosn-horizon-report-k12resources.org/) from the report is also an invaluable resource.

If you don't have enough time for the full report, [the preview](https://cdn.nmc.org/media/2017-nmc-cosn-horizon-report-k12-preview.pdf) provides insight into rethinking learning spaces and the role of teachers, and coding and digital literacy instruction. There is also a healthy dose of info in there about STEAM learning, makerspaces, robotics, Internet of things, virtual reality, and artificial intelligence.

### [How to recognize Russian propaganda on social media](http://lifehacker.com/how-to-recognize-russian-propaganda-on-social-media-1798503783)

This week an interesting thing happened in my social media feed. First, I came across [this piece](https://www.edutopia.org/blog/evaluating-quality-of-online-info-julie-coiro) by colleague [Julie Coiro](https://twitter.com/jcoiro) in Edutopia. The piece is excellent as it describes strategies to help adolescents evaluate online information. Much of this is from work that Coiro and I conducted during time with the New Literacies Research Lab.

Soon after receiving that post, I came across the post above from Lifehacker about the need to evaluate social media as a form of propaganda. In recent months we've discussed this here in TL;DR, I've been concerned about the weaponizing of social media as a means to spread disinformation and propaganda. With the post above from Coiro, and this one from Lifehacker, I'm thinking about the need to empower our students (from Pre-K up through higher ed) as informed, critical citizens.

The Lifehacker post shares work from the [Alliance for Securing Democracy](http://securingdemocracy.gmfus.org/) (an [organization launched by national security figures to counter Russian "mischief](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/josh-rogin/wp/2017/07/11/national-security-figures-launch-project-to-counter-russian-mischief/?utm_term=.36ec7259ca37)") and their [Hamilton 68 Disinformation Dashboard](http://dashboard.securingdemocracy.org/). The dashboard follows and analyzes 600 accounts associated with Russian influence campaigns.

In my classroom, I would follow the guidelines described by Coiro in empowering learners as healthy skeptics. I would then regularly peek into the Disinformation Dashboard to double check on some of the feeds shared there for more critique.

### [Maybe we all need a little less balance](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/22/well/mind/maybe-we-all-need-a-little-less-balance.html)

Throughout our days, many of us strive for balance as a means to make sense of reality and get through the day unscathed. This may take the form of meditation, eliminating decision fatigue, or a glass of cabernet.

This post from [Brad Stulberg](https://twitter.com/BStulberg) in the [NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/) suggests that balance — which essentially asks us to never go all-in on anything — is the right solution.

Rather, he suggests that we should strive for what psychologists call internal self-awareness, or the ability to see yourself clearly by assessing, monitoring and proactively managing your core values, emotions, passions, behaviors and impact on others. Put differently, internal self-awareness is about creating the time and space to know yourself; constantly check in with yourself (since your "self" changes over time); and then live your life accordingly.

### [15 reflection strategies to help students retain what you just taught them](http://www.teachthought.com/learning/15-reflection-strategies-help-students-retain-just-taught/)

Reflection was a fundamental element as a K12 teacher...and it's possibly more important now that I'm teaching teachers. One of my primary goals is to develop their skills as a healthy, reflective practitioner.

This post is a permanent bookmark in my teaching arsenal. Each semester I'll make sure that I utilize each of these strategies at least once in our work. At this point, the only pieces I don't use often are Prezi and Vlogging. I'll find a way this semester.

- Pair-Share
- Sentence Stem-based responses
- Layered Text
- Tweet
- 3-2-1
- Exit Slips
- Write-Around
- Podcast
- Brainstorming
- Jigsawing
- Prezi
- Vlog
- Collage
- Journaling

### [How to retain more from the books you read](https://medium.com/darius-foroux/how-to-retain-more-from-the-books-you-read-in-5-simple-steps-700d90653a41)

Darious Foroux shares some granular advice on how to synthesize as you read to make sure you take away more from the text. He suggests that we don't need to read more...just read smarter.

Foroux's system includes the following:

- **Have a purpose** - Why are you reading that text? Only read books that teach you how to overcome current challenges.
- **See yourself as a teacher** - Apply knowledge by sharing it. Devour your readings and share with others.
- **Highlight & make mental connections** - Take notes across books as you annotate while you read. When you get an application for an idea, attach a picture of your note/annotation to your idea.
- **Visualize & imagine** - A great way to make connections in your mind is to visualize what you're learning. We're visual learners, and our memories are also visual. Imagine that you're having a conversation with someone about what you've learned.
- **Immediately apply one piece of new knowledge** - Understand that growth doesn't happen by itself. Learning new skills, earning more money, having a great relationship — it all takes hard work. Remember that knowledge alone is completely useless. Apply it.
