## 🛠️ DO: Master the Art of Listening

[The Art of Listening](https://aeon.co/essays/the-psychologist-carl-rogers-and-the-art-of-active-listening) by M. M. Owen challenges us to cut through cognitive noise and truly hear others.  
- Empathic listening demands effort but signals care and connection.  
- Avoid the trap of categorizing or judging; instead, “put on” another’s perspective like a mental costume.  
_...the basic challenge of listening is this: consciousnesses are isolated from one another, and there are thickets of cognitive noise between them. Cutting through the noise requires effort. Listening well ‘requires that we get inside the speaker, that we grasp, from his point of view, just what it is he is communicating to us.’ This empathic leap is a real effort. It is much easier to judge another’s point of view, analyze it, categorize it. But to put it on, like a mental costume, is very hard._
**Why this matters:** Genuine listening is an increasingly rare skill in an age of digital distraction.
