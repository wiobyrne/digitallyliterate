Thank you once again for being one of the first to sign up for this newsletter. In this weekly email, I'll pull together some of the content that I shared out throughout the week. It's basically things that I think you should know & discuss. Please feel free to respond back, and share out with others.

This week I finally made it back into the Education Department at UNH. It was good to see my old colleagues. I also finished grading assignments and awarding badges for the [ORMS MOOC](http://wiobyrne.com/join-the-orms-mooc/).

I had three posts this week:
* [Continued Thoughts on Getting Things Done with Kanban and Trello](http://wiobyrne.com/continued-thoughts-on-getting-things-done-with-kanban-and-trello/)
* [Why You Should Build and Maintain Your One Space on the Internet](http://wiobyrne.com/why-you-should-build-and-maintain-your-one-space-on-the-internet/)
* [Deconstruct My Digital Identity Through a Glitch Remix Video](http://wiobyrne.com/deconstruct-my-digital-identity-through-a-glitch-remix-video-clmooc-make-cycle-1/)

Attended a [fantastic webinar](https://appsumo.wistia.com/medias/h818le4sfc) put together by [AppSumo](http://www.appsumo.com/invision/) and [Fedora](https://usefedora.com/). Starting to build up an online school and some classes. More on that at a later date.

### [Mr. Robot: Extended Sneak Peek - New Series on USA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJNZF3LR0VM)

[Mr. Robot](http://www.usanetwork.com/mrrobot) is a great new series starting up on the USA Network.

### [Nine Ways to Help Students Embrace the Revision Process](http://www.spencerideas.org/2015/06/nine-ways-to-help-students-embrace.html)

Adequate and appropriate tips to develop the revision process in your classroom. I value the "teacher as maker" thread embedded in the list.

I also value [John Spencer's website](http://www.johnspencer.me/2015/04/start-here.html) as I continue to edit my site.

### [This website only lets one person in at a time](http://www.engadget.com/2015/07/02/most-exclusive-website/?ncid=rss_truncated)

What?!?! Read more [here at the Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2015/07/01/the-single-most-useless-web-site-on-the-internet-is-a-page-only-one-person-can-visit-at-a-time/) ...or just sign up and get in line [here](http://mostexclusivewebsite.com/).

### [Were all those rainbow profile photos another Facebook study?](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/06/were-all-those-rainbow-profile-photos-another-facebook-experiment/397088/)

You have to remember that when something is free online...you're usually the piece for sale.

My thinking is that it is being tracked by Facebook. It would be fascinating data.

### [The (far-flung) future of wearables](http://www.fastcodesign.com/3047486/wears/from-mits-neri-oxman-the-far-flung-future-of-wearables?partner=rss)

Sure, we can think about our FitBits, Android Wear, and Apple Watches and how many steps in a day. But, what are your thoughts about "synthetically engineered microorganisms in custom-designed vessels"?

I'd rather have this instead of knowing that I need to walk more and I sleep horribly. :)

### [The future of man, machine, and work](http://blog.irvingwb.com/blog/2015/06/man-machine-and-work.html)

Fascinating post by [Irving Wladawsky-Berger](http://blog.irvingwb.com/about.html) in response to the piece from the [Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2015/06/man-machine-and-work).

I think we need to start considering (and defining/coding) what future we want with the machines...before it's too late. :)

### [The future of LEGO plastic](http://www.fastcoexist.com/3048017/why-lego-is-spending-millions-to-ditch-oil-based-plastic?partner=rss&utm_source=feedly&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=feedburner+fastcoexist&utm_content=feedburner)

Why is LEGO spending millions (and 15 years) to transition away from oil-based plastic? Good foresight...and a plan to move the toy/hobby industry.

### [New Zealand makes cyberbullying a crime](http://www.engadget.com/2015/07/04/new-zealand-cyberbullying/?ncid=rss_truncated)

I like the fact that this is focus by the government. I wonder how this will be implemented...and what the ramifications are.

### [How other Sriracha sauces compare to the original](http://skillet.lifehacker.com/tip-tester-how-other-sriracha-sauces-compare-to-the-or-1715326431)

Love it or hate it...you have to admit that it is everywhere. How good are the other brands/versions?

### [Make your own Google Cardboard for the classroom](http://www.howtogeek.com/221364/google-cardboard-virtual-reality-on-the-cheap-but-is-it-any-good/)

[Augmented and virtual reality](http://www.outerplaces.com/science/item/9154/virtual-reality-helps-bridge-the-gap-between-online-and-in-person-learning) may be the future of the classroom. To start preparing for the future...and possible headaches, dizziness, & nausea...build your own Google Cardboard and start testing.
