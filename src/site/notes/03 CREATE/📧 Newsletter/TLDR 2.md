Welcome to *Too Long; Didn't Read*, issue 2.

Thank you once again for being one of the first to sign up for this newsletter. In this weekly email, I'll pull together some of the content that I shared out throughout the week. It's basically things that I think you should know & discuss. Please feel free to respond back, and share out with others.

This week I finally made it back into the Education Department at UNH. It was good to see my old colleagues. I also finished grading assignments and awarding badges for the [ORMS MOOC](http://wiobyrne.com/join-the-orms-mooc/).

I had three posts this week:
- [Continued Thoughts on Getting Things Done with Kanban and Trello](http://wiobyrne.com/continued-thoughts-on-getting-things-done-with-kanban-and-trello/)
- [Why You Should Build and Maintain Your One Space on the Internet](http://wiobyrne.com/why-you-should-build-and-maintain-your-one-space-on-the-internet/)
- [Deconstruct My Digital Identity Through a Glitch Remix Video – #CLMOOC Make Cycle 1](http://wiobyrne.com/deconstruct-my-digital-identity-through-a-glitch-remix-video-clmooc-make-cycle-1/)

Attended a [fantastic webinar](https://appsumo.wistia.com/medias/h818le4sfc) put together by [AppSumo](http://www.appsumo.com/invision/) and [Fedora](https://usefedora.com/). Starting to build up an online school and some classes. More on that at a later date.

## 📺 Watch

### [Mr. Robot: Extended Sneak Peek](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJNZF3LR0VM)

[Mr. Robot](http://www.usanetwork.com/mrrobot) is a great new series starting up on the USA Network. A hacker drama that takes cybersecurity and digital privacy seriously.

## 📚 Read

### [Nine Ways to Help Students Embrace the Revision Process](http://www.spencerideas.org/2015/06/nine-ways-to-help-students-embrace.html)

Adequate and appropriate tips to develop the revision process in your classroom. I value the "teacher as maker" thread embedded in the list.

I also value [John Spencer's website](http://www.johnspencer.me/2015/04/start-here.html) as I continue to edit my site.

### [This Website Only Lets One Person in at a Time](http://www.engadget.com/2015/07/02/most-exclusive-website/?ncid=rss_truncated)

What?!?! Read more [here at the Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2015/07/01/the-single-most-useless-web-site-on-the-internet-is-a-page-only-one-person-can-visit-at-a-time/)...or just sign up and get in line [here](http://mostexclusivewebsite.com/).

### [Were All Those Rainbow Profile Photos Another Facebook Study?](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/06/were-all-those-rainbow-profile-photos-another-facebook-experiment/397088/)

You have to remember that when something is free online...you're usually the piece for sale.

My thinking is that it is being tracked by Facebook. It would be fascinating data.

### [The (Far-Flung) Future of Wearables](http://www.fastcodesign.com/3047486/wears/from-mits-neri-oxman-the-far-flung-future-of-wearables?partner=rss)

Sure, we can think about our FitBits, Android Wear, and Apple Watches and how many steps in a day. But what are your thoughts about "synthetically engineered microorganisms in custom-designed vessels"?

I'd rather have this instead of knowing that I need to walk more and I sleep horribly. :)

### [The Future of Man, Machine, and Work](http://blog.irvingwb.com/blog/2015/06/man-machine-and-work.html)

Fascinating post by [Irving Wladawsky-Berger](http://blog.irvingwb.com/about.html) in response to the piece from the [Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2015/06/man-machine-and-work).

I think we need to start considering (and defining/coding) what future we want with the machines...before it's too late. :)

### [The Future of LEGO Plastic](http://www.fastcoexist.com/3048017/why-lego-is-spending-millions-to-ditch-oil-based-plastic?partner=rss&utm_source=feedly&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=feedburner+fastcoexist&utm_content=feedburner)

Why is LEGO spending millions (and 15 years) to transition away from oil-based plastic? Good foresight...and a plan to move the toy/hobby industry.

### [New Zealand Makes Cyberbullying a Crime](http://www.engadget.com/2015/07/04/new-zealand-cyberbullying/?ncid=rss_truncated)

I like the fact that this is a focus by the government. I wonder how this will be implemented...and what the ramifications are.

### [How Other Sriracha Sauces Compare to the Original](http://skillet.lifehacker.com/tip-tester-how-other-sriracha-sauces-compare-to-the-or-1715326431)

Love it or hate it...you have to admit that it is everywhere. How good are the other brands/versions?

## 🔨 Do

### [Make Your Own Google Cardboard for the Classroom](http://www.howtogeek.com/221364/google-cardboard-virtual-reality-on-the-cheap-but-is-it-any-good/)

[Augmented and virtual reality](http://www.outerplaces.com/science/item/9154/virtual-reality-helps-bridge-the-gap-between-online-and-in-person-learning) may be the future of the classroom. To start preparing for the future...and possible headaches, dizziness, & nausea...build your own Google Cardboard and start testing.

## 🤔 Consider

### When something is free online...you're usually the piece for sale.

### I think we need to start considering (and defining/coding) what future we want with the machines...before it's too late.

These two observations from this issue frame the central tension of our digital lives. We trade data for convenience, attention for access, privacy for connection. And as AI and automation accelerate, the window for shaping that future narrows. The question isn't whether to participate in digital spaces—it's whether we do so with eyes open.
