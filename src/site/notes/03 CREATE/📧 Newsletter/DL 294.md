Hey there! Welcome back all. 

This week I posted the following:

- [*Memoir and the Creative Process*](https://wiobyrne.com/memoir-and-the-creative-process/) \- This is a follow-up to my earlier post about mental health and depression. We donâ€™t always recognize the gifts weâ€™re given by suffering through disappointing and difficult times until long after the fact.
- [*Today Is the Tomorrow We Should Have Prepared for Yesterday*](https://www.academia.edu/49291961/Today_Is_the_Tomorrow_We_Should_Have_Prepared_for_Yesterday_Rebuilding_Our_Classrooms_to_Facilitate_Student_Centered_Teacher_Sustaining_Tech_Supported_Education) \- A recent pub in Voices From The Middle looking at Post-COVID and education. As educators, we must focus on how we can use this crisis to re-center what we know to be most valuable about education: the peer and mentor relationships that underpin studentsâ€™ learning and the opportunities to pursue meaningful social and intellectual goals.
- [*Application for the WIRED Resilience Residency Program*](https://wiobyrne.com/memoir-and-the-creative-process/) \- I applied for the [WIRED Resilience Residency](https://www.wired.com/story/announcing-wired-resilience-residency/) but didn't make it past the first round. They received about 200 applications from around the globe. I'm interested to see who makes the cut. I'm sharing my letter of application to promote open scholarship and transparency.

I love the [My Analog Journal YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8TZwtZ17WKFJSmwTZQpBTA). 

It's basically like having a DJ show up in your house to play a set of music on given theme or genre. 

I also love process videos. In this video, they share the whole process of research, finding the records, recording, then finally releasing the video.

## [Common Challenges When Teaching About Equity and Social Justice](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1B9K_UPEV8CmS3JhK72tTvcFVBwRD-MPoHSdEO1xnHsg/edit)

Critical race theory has been studied for decades, but it received relatively little attention in the wider cultural sphere until the past year, when [conservatives adopted it as a catch-all term to demonize and discredit](https://newrepublic.com/article/162737/critical-race-theory-conservative-scam) the anti-racist, antiâ€“police brutality movements that sprang up in the wake of George Floydâ€™s murder. 

Its academic context, which is chiefly concerned with the endemic racism in American institutions and power structures, is being wielded as a means to [gin up a moral panic](https://www.newyorker.com/news/annals-of-inquiry/how-a-conservative-activist-invented-the-conflict-over-critical-race-theory).

## [Is This The Big Tech Break-UP We've Been Waiting For?](https://www.nytimes.com/2021-06-17/opinion/sway-kara-swisher-david-cicilline.html)

With an ambitious package of [Big Tech antitrust legislation](https://www.nytimes.com/2021-06-11/technology/big-tech-antitrust-bills.html), Congress is trying to restrain the power of Big Tech and stave off corporate consolidation. 

The [Platform Competition and Opportunity Act](https://cicilline.house.gov/sites/cicilline.house.gov/files/documents/Platform%20Competition%20and%20Opportunity%20Act%20-%20Bill%20Text%20%281%29.pdf), one of the five bills introduced last week, would effectively put an end to the tech giantsâ€™ ability to make acquisitions. 

This interview by Kara Swisher provides come context on whether such a broad ban could have serious unintended consequences and lead to less competition, not more. 

## [NTIA's Indicators of Broadband Need](https://broadbandusa.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=ba2dcd585f5e43cba41b7c1ebf2a43d0)

We like to think of the internet as a supremely easy way to connect to people all over the world, and in many regards this is true. For many, though, high-speed broadband is either unaffordable or completely unavailable.

This interactive map from the U.S. Department of Commerceâ€™s National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) shows that the problem is much worse that we initially thought. 

## [Why People Fall For Conspiracy Theories](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-people-fall-for-conspiracy-theories/)

*Every one of us has a brain that takes shortcuts, makes assumptions and works in irrational ways. The sooner we recognize that, and stop treating loved ones who have adopted conspiratorial beliefs as lost causes, the better we may be at curbing the beliefs that threaten our democracy and public health. Weâ€™re all human after all.* 

## [Evolution of the Dad](https://knowablemagazine.org/article/living-world/2021/evolution-dad)

Most male mammals have little or nothing to do with their kids. Why is our own species different? 

Many mysteries remain, though, about how human fathers evolved their peculiar, highly invested role, including the hormonal changes that accompany fatherhood. A deeper understanding of where dads came from, and why fatherhood matters for both fathers and children, could benefit families of all kinds.
