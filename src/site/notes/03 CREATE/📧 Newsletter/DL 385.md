- **Challenges**: Low-quality translations hinder the development of advanced AI systems for underrepresented languages. [Explore](https://stpp.fordschool.umich.edu/sites/stpp/files/2022-05/large-language-models-TAP-2022-final-051622.pdf).

Building equitable AI capabilities requires addressing biases in training data and improving access to high-quality datasets for lower-resource languages.
