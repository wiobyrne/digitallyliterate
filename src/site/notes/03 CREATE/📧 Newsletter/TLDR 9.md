# TLDR 9

## Too Long; Didn't Read Issue 9

**Published**: 2015-08-22 • [[03 CREATE/📧 Newsletter/📧 Newsletter\|📧 Newsletter]]

Thank you once again for being one of the first to sign up for this newsletter. In this weekly email, I curate content from the past week that you should check out. My goal is to keep you informed, without you having to stay connected to the firehouse of information online.

I started up my orientation meetings at the CofC this week. I met a group of great first-year faculty that came in brimming with new ideas and research. I also started unpacking my office and had my first department meeting on Friday. I'm finding some similarities with UNH, but also many new things. If you're in the area, come and [knock on my door](https://instagram.com/p/6feIkzrV1K/?taken-by=wiobyrne). :)

This week I posted:

* [Computational Participation: Coding and Programming as Literacy Activities](http://wiobyrne.com/computational-participation-coding-and-programming-as-literacy-activities/). This piece is the next column I'm submitting for JAAL. I worked with [Quinn Burke](http://teachered.cofc.edu/faculty-staff-listing/burke-quinn.php) and [Yasmin Kafai](http://scholar.gse.upenn.edu/kafai) to discuss opportunities for coding and programming in a literacy-based classroom. You can review and comment on the [draft here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1raUb9N-dqx8c8Vm3HdlndX8M1CVfdjm6tDawa81KpXY/edit).

## 📺 Watch

[The Martian | Official Trailer [HD] | 20th Century FOX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej3ioOneTy8)

[The Martian](http://www.foxmovies.com/movies/the-martian)

The trailer for the movie version of [the fantastic Andy Weir book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Martian_(Weir_novel))

was released this week. Do yourself a favor and [read the book](http://www.andyweirauthor.com/books/the-martian-tr/the-martian-hc)

before it comes out. The book is hard sci-fi with a Robinson Crusoe flair....[and disco](http://arstechnica.com/science/2014/11/stuck-on-mars-with-nothing-but-disco-ars-talks-with-the-martians-andy-weir/2/) .

I thoroughly recommend the [audiobook version](http://www.audible.com/pd/Sci-Fi-Fantasy/The-Martian-Audiobook/B00B5HZGUG) . I also think this could be an awesome book to read across an English and Science class. There is also a lot of Math involved. Be forewarned..there is some language in the text.

You should read this book and read it now. :)

## 📚 Read

### [The Horizon Reports are released](http://www.nmc.org/publication-type/horizon-report/)

Every year the [New Media Consortium (NMC)](http://www.nmc.org/)

releases a report on the technologies they believe will be trending over the next five years. The NMC is a community of hundreds of universities, colleges, museums, and research centers. The reports are Creative Commons (CC) licensed...meaning you can use them as you see fit.

Some of the reports that will be of high interest to you:

* [The 2015 K-12 Horizon Report](http://www.nmc.org/publication/nmc-horizon-report-2015-k-12-edition/)

* [The 2015 Library Horizon Report](http://www.nmc.org/publication/nmc-horizon-report-2015-library-edition/)

* [The 2015 Higher Ed Horizon Report](http://www.nmc.org/publication/nmc-horizon-report-2015-higher-education-edition/)

### [To learn more, this high-schooler left the classroom](http://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2015/08/19/432582341/to-learn-more-this-high-schooler-left-the-classroom?utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=education)

From [All Things Considered](http://www.npr.org/programs/all-things-considered/)

on [NPR](http://www.npr.org/sections/ed/) , this is the first of two stories from NPR this week that shine on unflattering light on the educational system in the U.S.

This first one is a bit more uplifting as they share the life and times of "Nick" as he creates his own learning plan...and classes.

### [Pew Research Report: Mobile messaging and social media 2015](http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/08/19/mobile-messaging-and-social-media-2015/)

The latest research report from the [Pew Research Center](http://www.pewresearch.org/)

focusing on what we're doing with our mobile devices, and how we're connecting/using social media.

The [breakdown on demographics of social media users](http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/08/19/the-demographics-of-social-media-users/) is interesting as we see Facebook is still king while Instagram (also a Facebook product) is a relatively close second. I'm also intrigued by the table I showed up top and our relationship with messaging apps that auto-delete content.

The full report is available [here](http://www.pewinternet.org/files/2015/08/Social-Media-Update-2015-FINAL2.pdf) .
