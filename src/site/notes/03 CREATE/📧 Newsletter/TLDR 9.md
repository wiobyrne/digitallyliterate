# TLDR 9

## Too Long; Didn't Read Issue 9

**Published**: 2015-08-22 • [[03 CREATE/📧 Newsletter/📧 Newsletter\|📧 Newsletter]]

Thank you once again for being one of the first to sign up for this newsletter. In this weekly email, I curate content from the past week that you should check out. My goal is to keep you informed, without you having to stay connected to the firehouse of information online.

I started up my orientation meetings at the CofC this week. I met a group of great first-year faculty that came in brimming with new ideas and research. I also started unpacking my office and had my first department meeting on Friday. I'm finding some similarities with UNH, but also many new things. If you're in the area, come and [knock on my door](https://instagram.com/p/6feIkzrV1K/?taken-by=wiobyrne). :)

This week I posted:

* [Computational Participation: Coding and Programming as Literacy Activities](http://wiobyrne.com/computational-participation-coding-and-programming-as-literacy-activities/). This piece is the next column I'm submitting for JAAL. I worked with [Quinn Burke](http://teachered.cofc.edu/faculty-staff-listing/burke-quinn.php) and [Yasmin Kafai](http://scholar.gse.upenn.edu/kafai) to discuss opportunities for coding and programming in a literacy-based classroom. You can review and comment on the [draft here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1raUb9N-dqx8c8Vm3HdlndX8M1CVfdjm6tDawa81KpXY/edit).

## 🔖 Key Takeaways

- **CofC Beginnings**: Orientation meetings with first-year faculty brimming with ideas, unpacking office, first department meeting.
- **Computational Participation**: New JAAL column with Quinn Burke and Yasmin Kafai on coding and programming as literacy activities.
- **The Martian**: Hard sci-fi Robinson Crusoe with disco—read the book before the movie, perfect for cross-curricular English/Science classes.
- **Horizon Reports Released**: NMC's annual tech trends for K-12, Libraries, and Higher Ed—all Creative Commons licensed.
- **Teacher Pipeline Crisis**: NPR reports on enrollment declines and teacher ed programs shutting down—larger societal issues at play.

## 📺 Watch

[The Martian | Official Trailer [HD] | 20th Century FOX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej3ioOneTy8)

[The Martian](http://www.foxmovies.com/movies/the-martian)

The trailer for the movie version of [the fantastic Andy Weir book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Martian_(Weir_novel) was released this week. Do yourself a favor and [read the book](http://www.andyweirauthor.com/books/the-martian-tr/the-martian-hc)

before it comes out. The book is hard sci-fi with a Robinson Crusoe flair....[and disco](http://arstechnica.com/science/2014/11/stuck-on-mars-with-nothing-but-disco-ars-talks-with-the-martians-andy-weir/2/) .

I thoroughly recommend the [audiobook version](http://www.audible.com/pd/Sci-Fi-Fantasy/The-Martian-Audiobook/B00B5HZGUG) . I also think this could be an awesome book to read across an English and Science class. There is also a lot of Math involved. Be forewarned..there is some language in the text.

You should read this book and read it now. :)

## 📚 Read

### [The Horizon Reports are released](http://www.nmc.org/publication-type/horizon-report/)

Every year the [New Media Consortium (NMC)](http://www.nmc.org/)releases a report on the technologies they believe will be trending over the next five years. The NMC is a community of hundreds of universities, colleges, museums, and research centers. The reports are Creative Commons (CC) licensed...meaning you can use them as you see fit.

Some of the reports that will be of high interest to you:

* [The 2015 K-12 Horizon Report](http://www.nmc.org/publication/nmc-horizon-report-2015-k-12-edition/)

* [The 2015 Library Horizon Report](http://www.nmc.org/publication/nmc-horizon-report-2015-library-edition/)

* [The 2015 Higher Ed Horizon Report](http://www.nmc.org/publication/nmc-horizon-report-2015-higher-education-edition/)

### [To learn more, this high-schooler left the classroom](http://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2015/08/19/432582341/to-learn-more-this-high-schooler-left-the-classroom?utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=education)

From [All Things Considered](http://www.npr.org/programs/all-things-considered/)

on [NPR](http://www.npr.org/sections/ed/) , this is the first of two stories from NPR this week that shine on unflattering light on the educational system in the U.S.

This first one is a bit more uplifting as they share the life and times of "Nick" as he creates his own learning plan...and classes.

### [Pew Research Report: Mobile messaging and social media 2015](http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/08/19/mobile-messaging-and-social-media-2015/)

The latest research report from the [Pew Research Center](http://www.pewresearch.org/) focusing on what we're doing with our mobile devices, and how we're connecting/using social media.

The [breakdown on demographics of social media users](http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/08/19/the-demographics-of-social-media-users/) is interesting as we see Facebook is still king while Instagram (also a Facebook product) is a relatively close second. I'm also intrigued by the table I showed up top and our relationship with messaging apps that auto-delete content.

The full report is available [here](http://www.pewinternet.org/files/2015/08/Social-Media-Update-2015-FINAL2.pdf) .

### [Copyright and Creative Commons (CC) explained](http://www.freetech4teachers.com/2015/08/copyright-and-creative-commons-explained.html#.VdhZYNNViko)

I believe copyright is a moving target as information is increasingly digitized. Creative Commons (CC) licensing helps us understand the possibilities for assigning and citing permissions and attributions on digital content. The challenge is that CC licensing is often tough to understand and use. This overview of resources by Richard Byrne pulls together a series of great pieces on the topic.

I also have a [collection of tutorials and guidance on CC licensing](http://wiobyrne.com/?s=creative+commons) if you're interested.

### [Must have Chrome apps for the new school year](http://www.educatorstechnology.com/2015/08/top-chrome-apps-for-teachers.html)

I just switched MacBook Pros as I moved from UNH to the CofC. In this process, the transition was relatively easy as most of what I do is baked into my Chrome browser. Once I sign into Chrome, it automatically syncs my information, apps, and extensions over to the new computer. I'm also frequently on a Chromebook, so this process is vital.

This list of Chrome apps is broken down by subject area and provides a good reference point for what you could/should be using.

### [Can innovation be taught?](http://www.edtechmagazine.com/higher/article/2015/08/can-innovation-be-taught)

Thought-provoking piece by [Nick Donofrio](http://www.edtechmagazine.com/higher/author/nick-donofrio) at [EdTech](http://www.edtechmagazine.com/higher/) looking at opportunities to rethink classroom instruction and build up a tech-savvy workforce.

### [Web literacies - A part of digital literacies](https://elnamortensen1.wordpress.com/2015/08/19/web-literacies-a-part-of-digital-literacies/)

Excellent overview of the intersection between digital literacies and the web literacies work I've been involved with over the last couple of years. [Elena Mortensen](https://twitter.com/elnamortensen1) provides a thoughtful synthesis and examination of the work that we've shared.

### [Teacher shortage? Or teacher pipeline problem?](http://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2015/08/19/432724094/teacher-shortage-or-teacher-pipeline-problem?utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=education)

This piece from [Morning Edition](http://www.npr.org/programs/morning-edition/) on [NPR](http://www.npr.org/sections/ed/) sparked some dialogue during the week. There is a serious problem in our educational system here in the U.S. Enrollments are down in teacher ed programs. Some teacher ed programs are shutting down. :(

I think there is a larger societal issue embedded in this discussion. I also wonder about the money, government (federal, state, local) leadership, and power behind the scenes that are forcing the issue on this debate.

## 🔨 Do

### [Make your iPhone/iPad videos look like VHS](http://nofilmschool.com/2015/08/vhs-camcorder-rarevision-ios-iphone-ipad-app)

When we create video we have this belief that it needs to look crystal clear, high definition, and perfect.

[VHS Camcorder](http://rarevision.com/vhscam/) (sadly only on [iOs](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/vhs-camcorder/id679454835?ls=1&mt=8) for now) distorts video in the same way we put filters on photos in Instagram. By forcing ourselves (and our students) to use media that is messy, distorted, and glitchy, we're possibly enabling them to be a bit more creative.

## 🤔 Consider

Starting at CofC this week brings excitement and possibility—new colleagues brimming with ideas, an office to unpack, familiar rhythms in unfamiliar spaces. Come knock on my door if you're in the area. :)

The computational participation column represents a shift in how we think about literacy. Coding isn't just a technical skill—it's a form of expression, a way of thinking, a literacy practice. When Quinn, Yasmin, and I talk about bringing programming into literacy classrooms, we're recognizing that writing code and writing text both involve composition, revision, and making meaning.

The Martian is more than a great sci-fi read—it's an example of how science, math, problem-solving, and storytelling intersect. "Read this book and read it now" isn't hyperbole. It's genuinely that good.

The teacher pipeline crisis mentioned in NPR's piece isn't just about enrollment numbers. It's about societal messages—what we value, who we support, what we're willing to invest in. When teacher ed programs shut down while the need for great teachers grows, something is deeply wrong. The money, leadership, and power dynamics behind this deserve scrutiny.

VHS Camcorder reminds us that perfection isn't always the goal. Sometimes messy, distorted, and glitchy opens creative doors that crystal-clear HD closes. Let students play with imperfection.
