Hi all, welcome to issue 239 of Digitally Literate.

Last week I talked about the [Online Learning Collective Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/onlinelearningcollective/) that I helped start up. As of this morning, there are almost 23,000 members in the group. We're also painfully aware that not all love Facebook. To that end, we're reaching out to [Twitter](https://twitter.com/olc_online) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/onlinelearningcollective/). I also moved our website to a [new location](https://onlinelearningcollective.org/). We've been getting [a lot of traction in the news](https://onlinelearningcollective.org/news/).

I continue to build out learning events in our [mentored, open online learning community](https://onlinelearningcollective.org/learning-commons/):

- [Moving across screens](https://onlinelearningcollective.org/learning-commons/le6/) - Multimodality and teaching materials
- [Show as opposed to tell](https://onlinelearningcollective.org/learning-commons/le7/) - Screencaptures and screencasting
- [Scaffolding student engagement](https://onlinelearningcollective.org/learning-commons/le8/) - Instructional scaffolding & ZPD
- [Reinventing the wheel](https://onlinelearningcollective.org/learning-commons/le9/) - OER and Creative Commons licensing

I also posted two episodes of the [Technopanic Podcast](https://screentime.me/technopanic-podcast/):

- [Digital Schools and Surveillance](https://screentime.me/digital-schools-and-surveillance/) - The challenges of digital surveillance in my son's school
- [Self-Care While Social Distancing](https://screentime.me/self-care-while-social-distancing/) - Joined by [Chris Mazura](https://twitter.com/chrismazura) on balancing parenting, teaching, and being human

It's important to acknowledge the grief you may be feeling, how to manage it, and how we can find meaning in it. We all have different levels of grief and express it in different ways.

- Let go of what you can't control
- Stock up on compassion

## 🤔 Consider

### Caring for myself is not self-indulgence, it is self-preservation, and that is an act of political warfare.

*Audre Lorde*

Lorde's words carry particular weight during pandemic. The pressure to be productive, to optimize quarantine, to emerge having learned a new skill—all of it misses what this moment requires. Self-care isn't indulgence when survival is the task at hand.
