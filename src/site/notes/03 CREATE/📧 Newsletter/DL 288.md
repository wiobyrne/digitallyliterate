"The mental health and well-being of teachers can have a really important impact on the mental health and well-being of the children who they're spending most of their days with," Jennifer Greif Green, an education professor at Boston University explains. "Having teachers feel safe and supported in their school environments is essential to students learning and being successful."

## [There’s a Name for the Blah You’re Feeling: It’s Called Languishing](https://www.nytimes.com/2021-04-19/well/mind/covid-mental-health-languishing.html)

Languishing is a sense of stagnation and emptiness. It feels as if you’re muddling through your days, looking at your life through a foggy windshield. And it might be the dominant emotion of 2021.

In psychology, we think about mental health on a spectrum from depression to flourishing. Flourishing is the peak of well-being: You have a strong sense of meaning, mastery and mattering to others. Depression is the valley of ill-being: You feel despondent, drained and worthless.

Languishing is the neglected middle child of mental health. It’s the void between depression and flourishing — the absence of well-being. You don’t have symptoms of mental illness, but you’re not the picture of mental health either. You’re not functioning at full capacity. Languishing dulls your motivation, disrupts your ability to focus, and triples the odds that you’ll cut back on work. It appears to be more common than major depression — and in some ways it may be a bigger risk factor for mental illness.

## [The Infrastructural Power Beneath the Internet as We Know It](https://thereboot.com/the-infrastructural-power-beneath-the-internet-as-we-know-it/)

 Control over underlying tech infrastructure determines who benefits from it, raising the prospect of alternative ownership and profit models. 
 
Perhaps we should begin thinking about Internet infrastructure in terms of a property landlord. It helps us think about power and what’s at stake when proposing alternatives to such centralization. Capital, and who controls it. 

What’s at stake for both the tech industry and government regulators isn’t what is or isn’t infrastructure, but what the ownership and profit model for that infrastructure looks like and whom it benefits. 

Substituting “the means of computation” for “infrastructure” isn’t going to make it any easier to alter those ownership models, but it might make it easier for us to focus on building and maintaining an internet that serves the public’s needs.

## [Welcome to the YOLO Economy](https://www.nytimes.com/2021-04-21/technology/welcome-to-the-yolo-economy.html)

Burned out and flush with savings, some workers are quitting stable jobs in search of postpandemic adventure.

[YOLO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YOLO_(aphorism)) is an acronym for "you only live once". Along the same lines as the Latin carpe diem ('seize the day'), it is a call to live life to its fullest extent, even embracing behavior which carries inherent risk. It became a popular internet slang term in 2012.

The pandemic is not over, and millions of Americans are still grieving the loss of jobs and loved ones. Not everyone can afford to throw caution to the wind. But for a growing number of people with financial cushions and in-demand skills, the dread and anxiety of the past year are giving way to a new kind of professional fearlessness.

## [The Blob Tree Test – ¿How do you feel today?](https://www.pedrosolorzano.com/en/test/the-blob-tree-test-how-do-you-feel-today/)

This is the Blob Tree test created by behavioural psychologist Pip Wilson, who is a psycho-educational gamester and EQ developer. This test helps us to recognize and strengthen emotions, and to some extent, understand our social status in society too. Each blob figure in this picture is in a different mood and has a different position on the tree.

How to use the Blob tree emotional test – There are hundreds of ways to use this image.

![Blobs](https://i1.wp.com/www.pedrosolorzano.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/blobtreepedro.jpg)

Each of the “blobs” in the tree has a different mood and have a different position. These are a variety of characters that express a variety of feelings. It is very important to use “blob”, instead of him or her, since they are not white men or women, they have no gender or color
