# TLDR 52

## Too Long; Didn't Read Issue 52

**Published**: 2016-07-01 • [[03 CREATE/📧 Newsletter/📧 Newsletter\|📧 Newsletter]]

Welcome to issue 52 of the TL;DR Newsletter. This week we are cognizant of all possible futures.

You can review [archives of the newsletter](http://us11.campaign-archive1.com/home/?u=7b5ee323a16720dad25ff96ff&id=17e92a2ae1). Alternatively you can also [check out TL;DR on Medium](https://medium.com/tldr-newsletter).

This week I worked on the following:

- [Three steps to become a digitally agile educator](http://wiobyrne.com/three-steps-digitally-agile-educator/) - This post detailed my latest thinking about the three steps I believe are needed to allow you to be digitally agile. This is motivated by my upcoming chapter on "being a digitally agile researcher." I'll share the rough draft in next week's TL;DR.
- [Kerri Lemoie on Coding and Programming](http://wiobyrne.com/4q4/2016/kerri-lemoie---coding-and-programming) - In this latest episode of the [4Q4 podcast](http://wiobyrne.com/4q4/), I spent some time talking with Kerri about possible futures for computer science in education.
- [Patrick Mockridge on credentials and the future of education](http://wiobyrne.com/4q4/2016/patrick-mockridge---future-of-credentials) - As part of the [BadgeChain Team](http://badgechain.com/), this podcast is part of the 4Q4 series and focuses on the blockchain and possibilities to disrupt educational credentialing. Patrick comes from an engineering background so this may be of interest to many of you.

## 📺 Watch

### [Big Thinkers - Alvin Toffler (22:25)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCXCDYj6U4E)

Futurist [Alvin Toffler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_Toffler) [passed away this week](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/30/books/alvin-toffler-author-of-future-shock-dies-at-87.html) at the age of 87. Alvin wrote and spoke about modern technologies, the digital revolution, and effects on culture.

His book [Future Shock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_Shock) distills these challenges into an examination of the psychological states of individuals and societies.

### [Teaching students to be public intellectuals](http://chronicle.com/article/Teaching-Students-to-Be-Public/236944/)

I often talk with my colleagues about the need for "us" to publicly engage online. This is one of the reasons I shared the post about being digitally agile up above. The latest round of these talks was held the night before I gave a recent keynote at [NIU](http://www.niu.edu/index.shtml). My thinking is that educators could (and should) think, write, and share openly in digital spaces.

This post in [The Chronicle of Higher Education](http://chronicle.com/) details a program at Stony Brook University in which the focus is not only on academics, but also undergraduate and graduate students. As the post indicates, our students are already engaging publicly...hopefully we can provide meaningful guidance. Perhaps they might offer us some insight. :)

I applaud this work and hope we see more opportunities for individuals to build and test these literacies and skills. Part of the challenge is in building, breaking, and iterating publicly online. I don't (usually) have problems with this. I think we need a safe, perhaps private space to allow learners to think, test, and obtain critical feedback on their work. Hopefully I can offer some of this soon with some of my colleagues.

### [Collapsed Publics: Orality, literacy, and vulnerability in academic Twitter](http://socialtheoryapplied.com/journal/jast/article/view/33/9)

Research publication (part of her dissertation) from [Bonnie Stewart](https://twitter.com/bonstewart) examining identities and connections between networked scholars on open networked platforms (Twitter). Follow [Bonnie's blog](http://bonstewart.com/).

The research examines "academic Twitter" and the challenges and opportunities that exist as scholars build network ties. These relationships may provide opportunities and affinities that may not be available at the local institution. The research presents a portrait of the experiences of networked scholars and considers the tensions these practices raise within the contemporary academy.

### [A blog for all seasons](http://readwriterespond.com/?p=2337)

A great post by [Aaron Davis](https://twitter.com/mrkrndvs) examining the different spaces that he uses to write and share online. Aaron is responding to the idea presented by [Doug Belshaw](https://twitter.com/dajbelshaw) about having [one canonical URL](http://dougbelshaw.com/blog/2015/04/21/canonical-urls/) for our digital identity.

I really enjoy Aaron's work, and specifically his identification of his multiple spaces online and their purposes. Most people get anxious about building one website and one unified digital identity. I'm in the same mindset as Aaron as I have multiple spaces online that I maintain.

I recommend checking out Aaron's post and his various online spaces. I really like the way that Aaron uses his own "art" as headers for his posts. While you're there, you [should subscribe](https://tinyletter.com/readwriterespond) to his monthly newsletter.

### [The Lego Bin](https://medium.com/@OfficeofEdTech/the-lego-bin-9191295fe1f5#.wglukbk3m)

Great post by [Andrew Marcinek](https://twitter.com/andycinek) creating parallels between Lego and IKEA hacks and the opportunity to hack together open educational resources (OER) for your instructional purposes.

This past week I was editing the front page of my website and I added the work "hacker" to the list of descriptors for my identity. I started thinking about how others would respond to me labeling myself a hacker. I Googled hacker and tried to understand what other definitions of hacker exist. I thought about watering it down and using the term "tinkerer" but instead stuck with hacker.

Andrew's post resonated with me not only for his focus on hacking, playing, and tinkering with Legos and IKEA products...but the connections to using OER bits and pieces in your classroom. The open and OER landscape is very much in the hobby stage at this point ([as Amazon tries to force their way in](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/28/technology/amazon-unveils-online-education-service-for-teachers.html?_r=0)). I think Andrew's framing was empowering, and I'll continue to use it as I work with colleagues, students, and clients.

### [Be careful what you code for](https://points.datasociety.net/be-careful-what-you-code-for-c8e9f3f6f55e#.41f2stsid)

Insightful post from [danah boyd](https://twitter.com/zephoria) discussing the "digital duct tape" that creates the technological world in which we live. danah indicates the challenges that exist as we (sometimes) fail to consider the power that exists in the code and what we use it for.

She posits:

> Code is key to civic life, but we need to start looking under the hood and thinking about the externalities of our coding practices, especially as we're building code as fast as possible with few checks and balances.

Thanks to Aaron Davis and his newsletter for sharing this post. :)

## 🔨 Do

### [Google has big updates at ISTE 2016](http://googleforeducation.blogspot.com/2016/06/updates-from-iste-4-new-tools-to-help.html)

Google did not waste any time making big news while at ISTE 2016. The [Expeditions app](https://www.google.com/edu/expeditions/) looks like it would be of use for most classrooms.

I'm most excited about [Google Cast for Education](http://www.freetech4teachers.com/2016/06/google-cast-for-education-gets-your.html?m=1) and [Google Forms that self-assess without add-ons](http://www.freetech4teachers.com/2016/06/google-forms-can-now-automatically.html?m=1). Google Apps for Education just gets better and better every day.
