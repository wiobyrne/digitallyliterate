** Too Long; Didn't Read (TL;DR) newsletter #68

------------------------------------------------------------

Welcome to issue 68 of the TL;DR Newsletter. In TL;DR I'm synthesizing what I read and learned this week in literacy, technology, and education. Bonjour.

This week we discuss possibilities for opening up your practice.

If you haven't already, I'd recommend that you subscribe (http://wiobyrne.us11.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=7b5ee323a16720dad25ff96ff&id=17e92a2ae1)  to make sure you don't miss out next week's issue. You can review archives of the newsletter here (http://us11.campaign-archive1.com/home/?u=7b5ee323a16720dad25ff96ff&id=17e92a2ae1) . Alternatively you can also check out TL;DR on Medium (https://medium.com/tldr-newsletter) . I'm also testing the reposting of these issues after a short delay on LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/wiobyrne?trk=nav_responsive_tab_profile) to see what happens.

This week I worked on a post for BadgeChain, guidance for online researchers, as well as a series of posts for Stoic Week 2016 (http://modernstoicism.com/q_lesson_page/introduction-to-stoic-week/) :

* Vertical teams and the open organizational structure of BadgeChain (https://medium.com/badge-chain/vertical-teams-in-the-open-organizational-structure-of-badgechain-4df543880c05#.msfqjvz0i)  - This post discusses some of our planning on opening up the organization a bit more as we plan for the next year of BadgeChain.

* Protecting yourself from online harassment while conducting risky research online (http://wiobyrne.com/imho/2016/protecting-yourself-from-online-harassment-while-conducting-risky-research-online) . This post is very important for my friends and colleagues that conduct research openly online, or use social networks. The link shares materials from the Data and Society project that include guidance for the researcher...as well as information for your administrators.

* Stoic reflections on life as a project and role models (http://wiobyrne.com/imho/2016/stoic-reflections-on-life-as-a-project-and-role-models)

* Seneca on practicing what you preach (http://wiobyrne.com/imho/2016/seneca-on-practicing-what-you-preach)

* Epictetus on what we can control in our own lives (http://wiobyrne.com/imho/2016/epictetus-on-what-we-can-control-in-our-own-lives)

* Marcus Aurelius on what we can control in our own lives (http://wiobyrne.com/imho/2016/marcus-aurelius-on-what-we-can-control-in-our-own)

* Examining your impressions (http://wiobyrne.com/imho/2016/examining-your-impressions)

## 📺 Watch

** This is how much I love airports (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nA0iy5feQU)

Incredible video documenting the ** Airportraits project (http://www.mpkelley.com/projects/)

, a photo series from ** Mike Kelley. (https://twitter.com/mpkelleydotcom)

In this project he shot thousands of photos of aircraft taking off and stitched them together to create one composite image. He also used light painting to blend natural and artificial light to create the composite image.

The end result is a series of photos, and one exciting video that documents the possibilities that exist as you play with digital media.

## 📚 Read

We talk a bit about open and open education here in TL;DR. It can sometimes be a challenge to unpack all of the strands of open and identify how they may work for us.

In ** this video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpOP6RZXzXQ)

, ** Robin DeRosa (https://twitter.com/actualham)

details everything you'll need to know about open education, open access, open educational resources, and open pedagogy.

This video provides a good primer as you (and your students) move toward ** open as an attitude (http://dougbelshaw.com/wiki/Open_is_an_attitude)

.

** Going to Flickr Zero, CC0 (http://cogdogblog.com/2016/10/flickr-cc0/)

This post from ** Alan Levine (https://twitter.com/cogdog)

documents his thought process as he considers, and then starts moving his flickr images to CC. This is a ** Creative Commons Zero License (https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)

and ** Maha Bali (http://blog.mahabali.me/blog/whyopen/on-attribution-vs-privilege-of-cc0/)

I have a ** series of posts on Creative Commons (http://wiobyrne.com/?s=creative+commons)

** How to work open (https://openmatt.wordpress.com/2011/04/06/how-to-work-open/)

Great post from ** Matt Thompson (https://twitter.com/OpenMatt)

providing some granular advice about why and how to work in the open. He also recounts some of the challenges involved in the process.

I will take away several key points from Matt's piece.

First, there are several possible goals for open:

* participation. rocket fuel for smart collaboration.

* agility. speed. flexibility. getting stuff done.

* momentum. communities want to push boulders that are already rolling.

* testing and rapid prototyping. iterating and refining as we go.

* leverage. getting greater bang from limited resources. punching above our weight.

Second, there are many "gears" for open. Open is not an on/off switch. It can be viewed as a series of levels of open that progress from closed to open to "shout it from the rooftops."

** 10 essential characteristics of a 21st century educator (http://georgecouros.ca/blog/archives/6783)

Post from George Couros identifying and defining ten characteristics he views as crucial for educators now and in the future.

* Relationship builder

* Learner/adapter

* Inclusive

* Reflective

* Networked/Collaborative

* Innovator

* Leader

* Storyteller

* Designer

* Artist

You can read the full definitions for each characteristic on George's post. I think this is important as a heuristic as we consider our own qualities as an educator. It is (perhaps) even more important as we consider how we prepare, develop, and evaluate educators.

** Assembling resources on Domain of One's Own (http://umwdtlt.com/assembling-resources-on-domain-of-ones-own/)

A Domain of One's Own (DoOO) is another topic that we talk a lot about here on TL;DR. I'll soon have a column on this topic coming out in JAAL, and with this I'll add a series of interviews to my podcast.

This post by ** Lee Skallerup Bessette (https://twitter.com/readywriting)

shares a ** collection of resources and articles (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lRbLw2UxaGUXTb6doJfFHfPsOr5NMnu3CvIAlOm5xgI/edit?usp=sharing)

on DoOO as well as a list of ** schools currently experimenting with DoOO (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19yWRmjE_pVTd09GW3U5ki7bk6OS7SE-uOwr7MsIQ_Cg/pubhtml)

. This research informed their earlier post on ** a brief history of DoOO (http://umwdtlt.com/a-brief-history-of-domain-of-ones-own-part-1/)

and an ** infographic (http://umwdtlt.com/an-infographic-of-ones-own/)

.

Terribly exciting stuff.

## 🔨 Do

** DIY Midori Style Travler's Notebook (http://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-Midori-Style-Travelers-Notebook/)

I've recently started using handwritten notes as I journal in a Moleskine for meetings, research, and general ramblings. One of the challenges is that I have a series of notebooks for different purposes. As you search for the "perfect" journal, you'll realize that is doesn't exist. If it does, the price is usually exorbitant for something that you'll (hopefully) fill up in a couple of months.

My current system uses ** this version of Moleskine (https://www.amazon.com/Plain-Cahier-Moleskine/dp/8883704940/ref=sr_1_16?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1196846504&sr=8-16)

, either lined or plain version. I can make my own midori notebook as detailed here and use that to hold everything together. When I'm finished with a journal, I draw something on the cover to remind me of the contents...and then add a new notebook.

By spending the time to create something nice for you to use...I think you'll value it, and your note-taking time even more.

## 🤔 Consider

It is a rough road that leads to the heights of greatness.
