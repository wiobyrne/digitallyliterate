## 📚 Read

------------------------------------------------------------

A new article from the New York Times Magazine details the decade-long history of ASMR, or Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response, tracing the trajectory from a small Facebook group of dedicated tinglers to a massive pop culture phenomenon. We’ve started to see this phenomenon sweep into the mainstream in advertising (https://adage.com/article/special-report-super-bowl/michelob-ultra-s-super-bowl-spot-asmr/316388) .

Of particular interest to me are the steps ASMR artists have taken (https://jezebel.com/the-women-of-asmr-have-to-become-experts-in-cybersecuri-1833809238) to protect themselves from creeps. Gibi (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCE6acMV3m35znLcf0JGNn7Q) suggests the following (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeAxDimRJTc&feature=youtu.be) :

I’ve learned a lot about cybersecurity. If you ever want to start a YouTube channel, delete everything, and then go back and delete more. Make everything private. Act like you have five million subscribers when you’re starting, because you can’t go back… People are naturally curious. They can look up if it’s raining where I am.

** How to Make Your Phone Limit Your Screen Time for You (https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/01/smarter-living/how-to-make-your-phone-limit-your-screen-time-for-you.html)

------------------------------------------------------------

Eric Ravenscraft (https://twitter.com/LordRavenscraft) in The NY Times on how to use tools built in to your smartphone to help you limit how much you use your devices.

If that doesn’t help, perhaps you’d like to fully convert your phone to minimalism (https://medium.com/the-minimalist-expat/minimalist-phone-98cedb6b20c9) . Thanks to Doug Belshaw (https://dougbelshaw.com/) for the tip. :)

** The paranoid person’s guide to online privacy (https://www.fastcompany.com/90316917/the-paranoid-persons-guide-to-online-privacy)

------------------------------------------------------------

So you think you want to be mindful and not be tracked online? Here’s the eight steps you’ll need to take. Can you do it?

* Ditch Facebook and anything to do with Facebook;

* If you want to use other social media, like Twitter, make your accounts anonymous and private;

* Use a burner phone for two-factor authentication;

* Say goodbye to Google;

* Use a secure browser, preferably Tor (https://www.torproject.org/) ;

* Use a VPN;

* Say goodbye to smart home products and android devices;

* Use a secure messaging app.

** Screentime has little effect on teenagers’ wellbeing, says study (https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/apr/05/screen-time-has-little-effect-on-teenagers-wellbeing-says-study)

------------------------------------------------------------

Alex Hern (https://twitter.com/alexhern) in The Guardian on a recent study, published in the (https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797619830329#articleCitationDownloadContainer) journal Psychological Science (https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797619830329#articleCitationDownloadContainer) . It is an important data point in the growing debate about whether excessive screen time can damage (https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/jan/04/screen-time-not-intrinsically-bad-for-children-say-doctors) the mental health of young people.

The research, based on analysis of the screen use of more than 17,000 teenagers across Ireland, the US and the UK, found use of screens before bedtime was completely unrelated to psychological wellbeing, and screen time more generally had a “minuscule” effect on wellbeing in teenagers when compared with other activities in an adolescent’s life.
