** Too Long; Didn't Read (TL;DR) newsletter #32

------------------------------------------------------------

Hi all. Welcome to the TL;DR Newsletter.

This week we do some thinking about waves, flow, and relativity. :)

These posts from my readings and work this week in literacy, technology. Please feel free to share with others you believe would benefit. If you like what you see here, I recommend subscribing (http://wiobyrne.us11.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=7b5ee323a16720dad25ff96ff&id=17e92a2ae1) to get it (electronically) hand-delivered.

This week I shared the following:

* Getting a simple website started with Known (http://wiobyrne.com/getting-started-in-known/) - This post is the first one in a series of posts looking at how to create and start writing on your own Known website.

* Lightweight blogging, publishing, and sharing using Known (http://wiobyrne.com/lightweight-blogging-publishing-and-sharing-using-known/) - This is the second post looking at the features of publishing and sharing using a Known site.

* Digitally Literate Courses: Identifying the problem, focus, and goals (https://medium.com/one-side-project-challenge/helping-educators-become-digitally-literate-a70a461d8bff#.749sud3qu) - I've hinted at this for some time in this newsletter, but I'm finally announcing my side project for the year. I'm developing a premium (pay) set of classes designed to help individuals become digitally literate. I'll have more info soon.

* Shape of a story (http://walkmy.world/start-walking/walk2016/le3/) - This week we launched Learning Event 3 in #WalkMyWorld 2016. Take a look at the post and come join us online.

** ids who played shoot-em-up games in the '90s were probably (mostly) ok (http://arstechnica.com/science/2016/02/kids-who-played-shoot-em-up-games-in-the-90s-were-probably-mostly-ok/)

While growing up, I was bombarded with "advice" from my parents and other adults that video games would rot my brain. Additionally, there is the belief that playing violent video games would lead to more violent kids.

** Recent research (http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0147732)

suggests that playing video games that are more likely to include violent content in childhood is weakly associated with an increased risk of conduct disorder in late adolescence. Additionally, overall game exposure was not related to conduct disorder, nor was any association found between video game use and depression.

Now if we could only do some research on whether or not Heavy Metal or Rap is not that bad...

** Data analysis of GitHub contributions reveals unexpected gender bias (http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/02/data-analysis-of-github-contributions-reveals-unexpected-gender-bias/)

** Research published in PeerJ (https://peerj.com/preprints/1733v1/)

examines the role of gender bias in the open source community.

The research examines acceptance rates of contributions of men versus women in the open source community. Surprisingly, results show that women's contributions tend to be accepted more often than men's. However, when a woman's gender if identifiable, they are rejected more often.

Results suggest that although women on GitHub may be viewed as more competent overall, gender bias exists nonetheless.

** The possibilities of badges and blockchain (http://dmlcentral.net/the-possibilities-of-badges-and-blockchain/)

This post from ** Doug Belshaw (https://twitter.com/dajbelshaw)

identifies the possible next steps in the development of badges and the possible integration of blockchain technologies. The post is a supplement to an ** earlier post (http://dmlcentral.net/peering-deep-into-future-of-educational-credentialing/)

on the future of educational credentialing.

In the comments of the post, Doug hints at an initiative many of us have been working on that ** just went public (https://medium.com/badge-chain/welcome-to-badgechain-f2d2d19ac561#.rsg4asxwd)

.

A small group of "ex-Mozilla colleagues and interested parties" have united to research, iterate, and advocate on the future of open badges and blockchain technologies. You can find more at ** our website (http://badgechain.com/)

...or follow our open thinking on ** our Medium publication (https://medium.com/badge-chain)

.

Very excited about this. More to come soon. :)

** My little sister taught me how to "Snapchat like the teens" (http://www.buzzfeed.com/benrosen/how-to-snapchat-like-the-teens#.wr9K2BzL0)

Great post from ** Ben Rosen (https://twitter.com/rosen)

in ** BuzzFeed (http://www.buzzfeed.com/)

in which he enlists his 13 year old sister to teach him how to use and connect on Snapchat.

What ensues is an insightful look at the habits and processes as his sister Brooke, and her friend Elsbitch (Elsbeth) give a guided tour of the medium.

** The ancient origins of your obsession with coloring books (http://www.fastcodesign.com/3056467/the-ancient-origins-of-your-obsession-with-adult-coloring-books?partner=rss)

I'm increasingly looking for insight into meditation and visual thinking...among other things. This post from ** Co.Design (http://www.fastcodesign.com/)

looks at the meditative practices involved in coloring and design.

At first you might think that this type of post has nothing to do with you...but I'd disagree.

The piece starts with Buddhist monks and sand painting...and then goes into flow, happiness, and destruction.

Good stuff.

** eep a "Today I Learned" log of all of the useful stuff your learn (http://lifehacker.com/keep-a-today-i-learned-log-of-all-the-useful-stuff-yo-1758286512)

Each day we learn little bits and strategies that help us complete tasks. Many times we employ what we've learned and move on from these "just in time" moments.

As I detailed in the links at the top of this newsletter...I started keeping a ** public journal (http://wiobyrne.com/imho/)

in which I write for five minutes (200 words) each morning. I use it as a way to get my mind running in the morning, unpack residual ideas/thoughts from the day before/dreams/morning. These posts may become something later on...or they might just be an archive of my thinking and learning over time. I chose to do this publicly...you don't have to. :)

Take five minutes each morning or night to stop, reflect, and celebrate what you learned that day. Document and archive your experiences.
