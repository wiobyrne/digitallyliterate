Welcome back to Digitally Literate and issue #263.

Let's face it, a lot happens each week in the news. A lot of important bits and pieces. I use this space each week to take time to highlight the things you need to know and provide some context. Enjoy. :)

This week I worked on the following:

## 📺 Watch

### [Dictators - Kim Jong-Un](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERQlaJ_czHU)

As a regular reader of this newsletter, we've talked about deep fakes a lot in the past. [Deep Fakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepfake) are machine learning products where a face or voice are replaced with those of someone else.

Creative agency [Mischief](https://mischiefusa.com/) at [No Fixed Address](https://nofixedaddressinc.com/) developed these deep fakes to shock viewers about the fragility of American democracy. Do yourself a favor and check out the websites for these companies…they're great. :)

### [Facebook and the Group That Planned to Kidnap Gretchen Whitmer](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/08/opinion/facebook-gretchen-whitmer.html)

This week, [13 people were charged with a plot to kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer](https://www.wxyz.com/news/fbi-michigan-ag-to-announce-details-of-major-operation-behind-raid-at-hartland-home). The *Wolverine Watchmen* [sought to instigate civil war](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan/2020/10/08/feds-thwart-militia-plot-kidnap-michigan-gov-gretchen-whitmer/5922301002/) by kidnapping the Governor and having her stand trial for treason.

We should have known this was coming as we see this wave of extremist groups radicalized online. [A line of rage that flows from online memes to real-world violence](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/10/08/michigan-plot-kidnapping-boogaloo-socialmedia/).

[Charlie Warzel](https://twitter.com/cwarzel) pulls these threads together and lays the blame of the feet of Zuckerberg and Facebook.

> With every bit of friction Facebook introduces to its platform, our information ecosystem becomes a bit less unstable. Flip that logic around and the conclusion is unsettling. Facebook, when it's working as designed, is a natural accelerating force in the erosion of our shared reality and, with it, our democratic norms.

### [How the truth was murdered](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/10/07/1009336/how-the-truth-was-murdered-disinformation-abuse-harassment-online-2/)

Pandemic, protest, and a precarious election have created an overwhelming flood of disinformation. [Abby Ohlheiser](https://twitter.com/abbyohlheiser) on why it didn't have to be this way.

> Irony-dependent meme culture has flourished over the last 10 years, with the racism and sexism often explained away by white reporters as simple viral humor. But the path jokes took into the mainstream, originating on message boards like 4Chan before being laundered for the public sphere by journalists, is the same route now used to spread QAnon, health misinformation, and targeted abuse. The way reporters covered memes helped teach white supremacists exactly how much they could get away with.

### [QAnon shows that the age of alternative facts will not end with Trump](https://www.cjr.org/opinion/qanon-trump-alternative-facts.php)

[Alice Marwick](https://twitter.com/alicetiara) and [Will Partin](https://twitter.com/william_partin) on QAnon, and the growing trend of people believing in things that are wrong.

[QAnon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QAnon) is a right-wing conspiracy premised on the idea that Donald Trump is working with military intelligence to bring down a global ring of child-eating pedophiles. Q researchers call themselves "bakers" and turn "crumbs" of information from Q (an anonymous account who claims to have insider knowledge of the Trump administration). The "bakers" research, aggregate, and combine these "crumbs" into "proofs" which are then "bread" or a form of worthy research.

In this, QAnon believers think they are paving the way for the "Great Awakening," an earth-shattering event in which all of Trump's enemies will be arrested for being Satan-worshipping pedophiles.

Marwick and Partin connect this group and their practices to Henry Jenkins's notion of [*participatory culture*](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Fans_Bloggers_and_Gamers/jj2eKl3NcBEC?hl=en&gbpv=0) and ask how is this any different than Star Trek or Harry Potter fans.

### [The Overlooked User](https://points.datasociety.net/the-overlooked-user-9e7d2b551772)

While social media has beneficial elements, it is also optimized for repeated, daily active use and is potentially harmful to the [mental health](https://hopelab.org/report/a-national-survey-by-hopelab-and-well-being-trust-2018/key-findings/) and [sense of well-being](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-67727-7) of some adolescent users, and has [some negative effects](https://www.pnas.org/content/116/21/10226) on adolescent users more generally.

[Amanda Lenhart](https://twitter.com/Amanda_Lenhart) and [Kellie Owens](https://twitter.com/_kellie_owens_) on how social media companies also need to take responsibility for how adolescents use their platforms.

### [8 Ways Gaslighters Manipulate and Control Relationships](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/communication-success/201908/8-ways-gaslighters-manipulate-and-control-relationships)

1. Chronic Lying
2. Normalize Falsehoods and Induce "Insecure Complex"
3. Debilitate the Victim and Suppress Dissent
4. Aggressive and Hostile When Confronted
5. Isolate and Divide
6. Perpetuate the Fake "Savior," Fake "Superiority" Myths
7. Offer False Promises
8. Social Domination and Psychological Control

## 🔨 Do

### [How to guard your social feeds against election misinformation](https://www.vox.com/recode/21396326/misinformation-social-feed-facebook-twitter-election)

Preparing for misinformation might mean decluttering your feed, or making some suggestions to your friends and family.

Practice saying this along with me:

"Like you, I am concerned about the XXXX. Like you, I am concerned about the direction of this XXXX. However, there are other sources out there that may dispute some of the facts and dispute some of the stuff that you're talking about."

**Connected concepts**:
- [[Facebook Platform Design and Extremism\|Facebook Platform Design and Extremism]] - Charlie Warzel's insight that "Facebook, when it's working as designed, is a natural accelerating force in the erosion of our shared reality" reveals the fundamental problem. The Michigan kidnapping plot wasn't a platform failure—it was the system working exactly as engineered. Every friction reduction makes information ecosystems less stable, meaning the path from online radicalization to real-world violence isn't a bug but an architectural feature. This connects to questions about whether platforms can be reformed or must be fundamentally redesigned.
- [[Disinformation Infrastructure and Laundering\|Disinformation Infrastructure and Laundering]] - Abby Ohlheiser's observation about the 4Chan-to-journalism pipeline reveals how media coverage itself became disinformation infrastructure. Journalists explaining away racist memes as "viral humor" taught white supremacists the laundering process: originate on fringe boards, get mainstream coverage, achieve legitimacy. The same route now spreads QAnon and health misinformation. This connects to media literacy questions about whether teaching source evaluation is sufficient when legitimate outlets amplify fringe content.
- [[QAnon as Corrupted Participatory Culture\|QAnon as Corrupted Participatory Culture]] - Marwick and Partin's connection between QAnon and fan cultures (Star Trek, Harry Potter) is disturbing because it's accurate. "Bakers" doing "research" on "crumbs" to create "bread" uses the same collaborative meaning-making mechanisms as fandoms. The difference is QAnon aims to justify political violence rather than explore fictional worlds. This raises questions about when participatory culture's strengths—collective intelligence, creative collaboration—become weaponized for radicalization.
