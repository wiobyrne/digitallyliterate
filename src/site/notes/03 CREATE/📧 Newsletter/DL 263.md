Hi all, welcome back to Digitally Literate and issue 263.

Let's face it, a lot happens each week in the news. I use this space each week to take time to highlight the things you need to know and provide some context.

This week I worked on the following:

- [How & Why You Should Dox Yourself on the Internet](https://wiobyrne.com/how-why-you-should-dox-yourself-on-the-internet/) - Moving beyond Googling yourself to see what info you really have online.
- [Building Up Your Digital Identity](https://wiobyrne.com/building-up-your-digital-identity/) - Who is the you that you want to be online? Build it.
- [Come Badge With Me](https://wiobyrne.com/come-badge-with-me/) - I ran a workshop to discuss digital badges in middle grades and high school.
- [Sitting Between Life and Death](https://wiobyrne.com/sitting-between-life-and-death/) - As our world becomes increasingly digitized, an interesting phenomenon occurs as people die.
- [Trouble Sounding Stupid](https://wiobyrne.com/trouble-sounding-stupid/) - How do we support individuals as they leap out on that stage and speak their narrative?
- [Exposure Builds Credibility](https://wiobyrne.com/exposure-builds-credibility/) - Write. Write. Write. Repeat.

### [Deep Fakes and Democratic Fragility](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERQlaJ_czHU)

As a regular reader of this newsletter, we've talked about [deep fakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepfake) a lot in the past. Deep fakes are machine learning products where a face or voice are replaced with those of someone else.

Creative agency [Mischief](https://mischiefusa.com/) at [No Fixed Address](https://nofixedaddressinc.com/) developed these deep fakes to shock viewers about the fragility of American democracy.

### [From Online Memes to Real-World Violence](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/10/08/michigan-plot-kidnapping-boogaloo-socialmedia/)

This week, 13 people were charged with a [plot to kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer](https://www.wxyz.com/news/fbi-michigan-ag-to-announce-details-of-major-operation-behind-raid-at-hartland-home). The Wolverine Watchmen sought to [instigate civil war](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan/2020/10/08/feds-thwart-militia-plot-kidnap-michigan-gov-gretchen-whitmer/5922301002/) by kidnapping the Governor and having her stand trial for treason.

We should have known this was coming as we see this wave of extremist groups radicalized online. A line of rage that flows from online memes to real-world violence.

[Charlie Warzel](https://twitter.com/cwarzel) pulls these threads together and lays the blame at the feet of Zuckerberg and Facebook: With every bit of friction Facebook introduces, our information ecosystem becomes a bit less unstable. Flip that logic around and the conclusion is unsettling. Facebook, when it's working as designed, is a natural accelerating force in the erosion of our shared reality.

### [How the Truth Was Murdered](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/10/07/1009336/how-the-truth-was-murdered-disinformation-abuse-harassment-online-2/)

Pandemic, protest, and a precarious election have created an overwhelming flood of disinformation. [Abby Ohlheiser](https://twitter.com/abbyohlheiser) on why it didn't have to be this way.

Irony-dependent meme culture has flourished over the last 10 years, with racism and sexism often explained away as simple viral humor. But the path jokes took into the mainstream—originating on 4Chan before being laundered for the public sphere by journalists—is the same route now used to spread QAnon, health misinformation, and targeted abuse.

### [QAnon Shows the Age of Alternative Facts Will Not End with Trump](https://www.cjr.org/opinion/qanon-trump-alternative-facts.php)

[Alice Marwick](https://twitter.com/alicetiara) and [Will Partin](https://twitter.com/william_partin) on QAnon and the growing trend of people believing in things that are wrong.

[QAnon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QAnon) believers call themselves "bakers" and turn "crumbs" of information from Q into "proofs" which are then "bread" or worthy research. Marwick and Partin connect this group and their practices to Henry Jenkins's notion of [participatory culture](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Fans_Bloggers_and_Gamers/jj2eKl3NcBEC) and ask how is this any different than Star Trek or Harry Potter fans.

### [The Overlooked User](https://points.datasociety.net/the-overlooked-user-9e7d2b551772)

While social media has beneficial elements, it is also optimized for repeated, daily active use and is potentially [harmful to the mental health](https://hopelab.org/report/a-national-survey-by-hopelab-and-well-being-trust-2018/key-findings/) and [sense of well-being](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-67727-7) of some adolescent users.

[Amanda Lenhart](https://twitter.com/Amanda_Lenhart) and [Kellie Owens](https://twitter.com/_kellie_owens_) on how social media companies also need to take responsibility for how adolescents use their platforms.

### [8 Ways Gaslighters Manipulate and Control Relationships](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/communication-success/201908/8-ways-gaslighters-manipulate-and-control-relationships)

1. Chronic Lying
2. Normalize Falsehoods and Induce "Insecure Complex"
3. Debilitate the Victim and Suppress Dissent
4. Aggressive and Hostile When Confronted
5. Isolate and Divide
6. Perpetuate Fake "Savior," Fake "Superiority" Myths
7. Offer False Promises
8. Social Domination and Psychological Control

## 🔨 Do

### [Preparing for Misinformation Conversations](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/06/05/stop-spreading-misinformation/)

Preparing for misinformation might mean decluttering your feed, or making some suggestions to your friends and family.

Practice saying this: "Like you, I am concerned about the XXXX. Like you, I am concerned about the direction of this XXXX. However, there are other sources out there that may dispute some of the facts and dispute some of the stuff that you're talking about."

## 🤔 Consider

### The most effective way to destroy people is to deny and obliterate their own understanding of their history.

*George Orwell*

Orwell's insight frames a week where truth was murdered through meme culture laundering, participatory conspiracy-building, and platforms designed to accelerate reality erosion. When we can't agree on what happened, we can't agree on what to do next.
