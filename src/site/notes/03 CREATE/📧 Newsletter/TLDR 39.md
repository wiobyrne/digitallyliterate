# TLDR 39

## Too Long; Didn't Read Issue 39

**Published**: 2016-04-01 • [[03 CREATE/📧 Newsletter/📧 Newsletter\|📧 Newsletter]]

Hi all. Welcome to the TL;DR Newsletter. This week we'll discuss microlearning, extraterrestrials, & grammar jerks.

I'm always tweaking TL;DR to better suit you. If you have feedback, questions, or concerns...please feel free to the "reply" button and send me a response. I'd love to hear from you.

If you haven't already, I'd recommend that you subscribe to make sure you don't miss out next week's issue.

This week I shared the following:

- [The Story of Us](http://walkmy.world/start-walking/walk2016/le10/) - This week we launched our final learning event...Learning Event 10 in WalkMyWorld 2016. Take a look at the post and come join us online. The materials are always up and online if you want to use them in your classes.

## 🔖 Key Takeaways

- **I'd Love to Hear**: I'm always tweaking TL;DR to better suit you. If you have feedback, questions, or concerns...please feel free to the "reply" button and send me a response. I'd love to hear from you.
- **Still Have Fear**: Douglas Rushkoff post that popped up just as I was finalizing materials for this week's issue. I immediately shared it out...even though I still have fear that it might be an April Fool's prank. :)
- **I Include Most**: I include most of these in my lessons and courses. I'll highlight my lesson/class objectives and rebuild much shorter (high quality) video.
- **I'll Keep You Posted**: My possible use case scenario that I'll test drive next semester is to use it and share the "focus" of the week or module for my classes. I'll keep you posted as I investigate this some more.
- **I Would Recommend**: You may not be a professional animator, but I would recommend installing on a computer in your classroom and allowing students to see what they can make.

### [Learning to code yields diminishing returns](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/learning-code-yields-diminishing-returns-douglas-rushkoff)

Post from [Douglas Rushkoff](https://twitter.com/rushkoff) that popped up just as I was finalizing materials for this week's issue. I immediately shared it out...even though I still have fear that it might be an April Fool's prank. :)

Rushkoff details the concerns that we must have as we point to the need to train and develop legions of coders and programmers for the future.

I've been thinking, writing, and interviewing numerous experts about coding and programming over the past couple of weeks. This column presents much needed insight into the challenges that might exist in these eventualities.

### [Microlearning, millennials and successful companies](https://blog.teachlr.com/microlearning-millennials-2/)

Awesome post from the [TeachLr Blog](https://blog.teachlr.com/) that buries some great actionable advice at the bottom of the post.

As you work with millennials, you need to allow them to control their time, while empowering them to connect with engaging content. Specifically, "microlearning" adjusts because it is autonomous, independent, and practical.

To make this happen, the authors indicate the following elements to include in your teaching practice:

- Clear learning objectives
- Content outline and structure
- An objective per lesson
- Short lessons on high quality video
- Interchangeable lessons
- Practical lessons
- Tracking of results
- Certificates

I include most of these in my lessons and courses. I'll highlight my lesson/class objectives and rebuild much shorter (high quality) video.

### [10 seconds at a time, a teacher tries Snapchat to engage students](http://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2016/03/29/467091289/how-teachers-are-using-snapchat)

Awesome thinking about the possible use of Snapchat in a higher ed classroom. Specifically, this post shares examples of Michael Britt, an adjunct professor at Marist College and his introductory psychology class.

I've been trying to figure out, or find a meaningful way to utilize a tool like Snapchat or Periscope/Meerkat in my classes. What I don't like is that it's an ethereal use of digital content. It automatically deletes after a set period of time.

My possible use case scenario that I'll test drive next semester is to use it and share the "focus" of the week or module for my classes. I'll frequently share out blog posts, or video clips indicating what they need to pay attention to that week for my classes. I'm thinking this could be the "lesson objectives" I indicated up above. This would allow me to share this info...and then not worry about old videos clips hogging up my YouTube account.

I'll keep you posted as I investigate this some more.

### [Study: People who point out typos are jerks](http://gizmodo.com/study-people-who-point-out-typos-are-jerks-1767969516)

[Research](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0149885) from the [University of Michigan](http://www.ns.umich.edu/new/releases/23635-personality-influences-how-one-reacts-to-email-errors) investigating the interpretation of language in emails as it relates to personality traits of the reader.

Apparently people that are more sensitive to typos and grammatical errors a bit "Type A" and less tolerant of most signs of deviant grammatical behavior.

### [The Hyper Island toolbox](http://toolbox.hyperisland.com/)

This collection of learning activities is a definite must to save for your classroom or learning environment. You will also find opportunities to work this in to your workplace as you connect and collaborate with colleagues. From discussions about innovation to team building...there's resources for everyone.

## 🔨 Do

### [OpenToonz, the 2D animation software is now free](http://lifehacker.com/opentoonz-the-2d-animation-software-used-by-studio-ghi-1767833445)

[OpenToonz](http://www.toonzpremium.com/#!news/aawrs) is a powerful 2D animation production software that you can [use to make animation](http://makezine.com/2016/03/25/the-animation-software-that-brought-you-studio-ghibli-films-is-now-open-source/). Now that it's open source, I think we'll start to see numerous tools and plugins pop up around it.

You may not be a professional animator, but I would recommend installing on a computer in your classroom and allowing students to see what they can make.

Carl Sagan and Studs Terkel animated on the Blank on Blank web series. They discuss religion, and the possibility of life on other planets. The discussion is awesome. The animation brings it forward. The possibilities multiply.

Douglas Rushkoff post that popped up just as I was finalizing materials for this week's issue. I immediately shared it out...even though I still have fear that it might be an April Fool's prank. :) The timing is perfect. The fear is parenthetical. Rushkoff details the concerns that we must have as we point to the need to train and develop legions of coders and programmers for the future. I've been thinking, writing, and interviewing numerous experts about coding and programming over the past couple of weeks. This column presents much needed insight into the challenges that might exist in these eventualities. The concerns are detailed. The insight is needed. The challenges loom.

University of Michigan research investigating the interpretation of language in emails as it relates to personality traits of the reader. Apparently people that are more sensitive to typos and grammatical errors a bit "Type A" and less tolerant of most signs of deviant grammatical behavior. The research confirms. The jerks are identified. The tolerance is low.

Carl Sagan: If you wish to make an apple pie from scratch, you must first invent the universe. WalkMyWorld final event and microlearning and extraterrestrials and coding concerns and Snapchat ephemera and grammar jerks and Hyper Island and OpenToonz. Microlearning, extraterrestrials, & grammar jerks. All forms of invention. All requiring the universe. The question remains: what do we invent when we make from scratch?
