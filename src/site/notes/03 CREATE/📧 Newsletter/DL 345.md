## 🛠️ DO: Flatten Organizational Hierarchies

Learn to minimize the negative aspects of hierarchy in team dynamics:

1. **Use conscious language**: Avoid terms that reinforce power imbalances (e.g., “promotion” for management roles).  
2. **De-emphasize power symbols**: Focus on collaboration rather than hierarchy.  
3. **Encourage advancement for all**: Create equal opportunities for both individual contributors and managers.  
4. **Promote equality in everyday actions**: Simple acts like “doing your own dishes” can foster mutual respect.  
5. **Visualize support structures**: Consider an upside-down org chart where managers support teams from below.
