Self-preservation, not self-indulgence

Digitally Lit #239 - 3/28/2020

Hi all, welcome to issue #239 of Digitally Literate.

Last week I talked about the Online Learning Collective Facebook Group (https://www.facebook.com/groups/onlinelearningcollective/) that I helped start up. As of this morning, there are almost 23,000 members in the group. We’re also painfully aware that not all love Facebook. To that end, we’re reaching out to Twitter (https://twitter.com/olc_online) , and Instagram (https://www.instagram.com/onlinelearningcollective/) . I also moved our website to a new location (https://onlinelearningcollective.org/) . We’ve been getting a lot of traction in the news (https://onlinelearningcollective.org/news/) .

I continue to build out learning events in our mentored, open online learning community (https://onlinelearningcollective.org/learning-commons/) . Specifically, I built these:

* Moving across screens (https://onlinelearningcollective.org/learning-commons/le6/) - Multimodality and teaching materials

* Show as opposed to tell (https://onlinelearningcollective.org/learning-commons/le7/) - Screencaptures and screencasting

* Scaffolding student engagement (https://onlinelearningcollective.org/learning-commons/le8/) - Instructional scaffolding & ZPD

* Reinventing the wheel (https://onlinelearningcollective.org/learning-commons/le9/) - OER and Creative Commons licensing

I also posted two episodes of the Technopanic Podcast (https://screentime.me/technopanic-podcast/) :

* Digital Schools and Surveillance (https://screentime.me/digital-schools-and-surveillance/) - In this episode Kristen and I talk about the challenges of digital surveillance in my son’s school.

* Self-Care While Social Distancing (https://screentime.me/self-care-while-social-distancing/) - In this episode we are joined by Chris Mazura (https://twitter.com/chrismazura) as we talk about how to balance parenting, teaching, and being a human without losing our minds.

## 📺 Watch

------------------------------------------------------------

Half-Life: Alyx (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life:_Alyx) is a virtual reality game.

Charles Coomber, a Meet Mr. Charles Coomber, a San Diego-based teacher at Otay Ranch Academy for the Arts, used Half Life: Alyx, as a makeshift whiteboard (https://thenextweb.com/shareables/2020/03/26/half-life-alyx-math-teacher-vr/) to teach math. Pretty cool.

## 📚 Read

------------------------------------------------------------

Let’s not lose high touch when we move to high tech.

Here’s 5 ways to keep it human:

* Simplify & be flexible

* Don’t assume people have reliable tech, or understand how to use it

* Look for ways to build community

* Don’t be afraid to crowdsource ideas

* Keep the big picture in mind

I recommend this resource on 14 tips for connecting with others that have limited Internet resources (https://www.kqed.org/mindshift/55608/14-tips-for-helping-students-with-limited-internet-have-distance-learning) .

It is important that we think first about student agency (https://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/university-venus/student-agency-uncertain-times) in these times. This series of interviews (https://www.insidehighered.com/digital-learning/article/2020/03/25/how-shift-remote-learning-might-affect-students-instructors-and#.XntGmu6H4cc.twitter) with experts in the field (most of you are readers of this newsletter :) ) is a great reflection point.

** That Discomfort You’re Feeling Is Grief (https://hbr.org/2020/03/that-discomfort-youre-feeling-is-grief)

------------------------------------------------------------

It’s important to acknowledge the grief you may be feeling, how to manage it, and how we can find meaning in it.

We all have different levels of grief and express it in different ways.

A couple ways to acknowledge & deal with this anxiety & grief:

* find balance in the things you’re thinking;

* calm yourself by coming into the present;

* let go of what you can’t control;

* stock up on compassion.

** What It’s Like to Quarantine With Kids (https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-25/what-it-s-like-to-quarantine-with-kids)

------------------------------------------------------------

I had a recent interview with Joshua Brustein (https://twitter.com/joshuabrustein) from Bloomberg. Here’s some of results from that fun discussion.

On the topic of screentime, this piece (https://theconversation.com/screen-time-that-supports-new-parents-and-young-kids-can-enhance-family-health-122280) from Dorian Traube (https://twitter.com/DorianTraube) and Ashwini Lakshmanan (https://www.chla.org/profile/ashwini-lakshmanan-md-mph) at The Conversation is great. The focus is on tele-health and children.

** Make “work from home” work for you (https://www.blog.google/inside-google/googlers/make-work-from-home-work-for-you/)

------------------------------------------------------------

This is primarily an ad for Google Apps, but it provides a ton of great principles to consider as you think about how to make “work from home” work for you. You can find the same info here (https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/mar/26/how-to-study-at-home-during-coronavirus-by-online-students-and-tutors) in a different context.

#1 tip for mental health: Work at home doesn’t mean working all of the time.

* Designate your “spot” for working

* Use video chat like a pro

* Practice “one tab working”

* Act the part

* Play with your schedule & energy

* Don’t work all of the time

* Create “to-do list” the day before

* Finish one thing per day

* Cut yourself some slack

** How to Clean and Disinfect All Your Gadgets (https://www.howtogeek.com/663058/how-to-clean-and-disinfect-all-your-gadgets/)

------------------------------------------------------------

Make time in your schedule to clean & disinfect all of your gadgets this weekend. Seriously. We need you to stay healthy at home.

Whether you want to protect against COVID-19 or just give all your gadgets a deep-clean while you’re stuck at home, now’s the ideal time! Here’s how you can safely clean your tech gadgets, without damaging anything.

## 🔨 Do

------------------------------------------------------------

As a member of the Online Learning Collective, we’d love to hear your story during these trying times.

We started up a Speakpipe on our website to record 90 second messages about how you’ve been impacted personally and/or professionally. I’ll upload all of these messages to the Internet Archive.

Please take time to document this time. Please share with others.
