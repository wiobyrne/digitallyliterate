Welcome to TL;DR Newsletter #87. Each week I'm identifying some of the key things to know from the past week. Thanks for joining us.

This week's issue is about test patterns.

This week I shared the following:

- TEDx Charleston 2017 - This week I applied to speak at the upcoming meeting of TEDx Charleston. I applied unsuccessfully last year and this year put my hat back in the ring. I'll soon share my application materials and lessons learned in case this helps others.

## 🔖 Key Takeaways

- **We Need to Expect**: We need to expect a better understanding of privacy and security from vendors that would like to sell us devices like this.
- **As These Hacks Take Place**: This would create a space for agreements in which governments agree to avoid cyber attacks that target the private sector or infrastructure. As these hacks take place, and governments target businesses and other countries, average citizens are often the ones that get hurt the most.
- **I'm Excited With**: I'm excited with some of the recent reporting that Teen Vogue has been sharing. I'm also thrilled to see that they're informing readers to be more critical users of technology.
- **I Share Much of This Thinking**: I share much of this thinking as I explore and promote open scholarship in my research. It often requires rethinking issues of privacy and security as we make sure that we protect research subjects while ensuring validity.
- **I Also Think It's Important**: I also think it's important for researchers to make science and research a bit more understandable and open for all to interpret.
- **I'm Excited to See**: I think this post on emoji being included in a reading test is an example of a Rorschach Test to see how individuals view these discussions and their impact on the classroom. I'm excited to see the inclusion of emoji in these assessments.

## 📺 Watch

### [Cloud Pets Commercial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcxNHgYUz6s)

As devices are increasingly connected to the Internet, we need to take some time to think about how this might open up privacy and security issues.

This week it came to light that the Cloud Pets Internet connected talking toy had [serious data breaches](http://fortune.com/2017/02/28/cloudpets-data-leak/). This means that as you are sending a voice message to your child, or your child is calling back..your Cloud Pet might also be listening in and slurping up data and discussions from your home.

We need to expect a better understanding of privacy and security from vendors that would like to sell us devices like this.

### [You are the target of of today's cyberwars](https://backchannel.com/todays-cyberwars-target-civilians-and-we-need-protections-ba32a4bd496e#.l3imeoibh)

A post from [Jeremy Hsu](https://twitter.com/jeremyhsu) on [Backchannel](https://backchannel.com/?source=logo-lo_dnt_d6abe2c0fb90---d16afa0ae7c). The post begins with a look at a post and video from Brad Smith from Microsoft in which they posit the need for a [Digital Geneva Convention](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2017/02/14/need-digital-geneva-convention/#sm.00012pteds5t9fhzzm32fd6mhczai).

This would create a space for agreements in which governments agree to avoid cyber attacks that target the private sector or infrastructure. This agreement would also try to protect groups that try to hack or steal intellectual property.

As these hacks take place, and governments target businesses and other countries, average citizens are often the ones that get hurt the most.

### [How to keep messages secure](http://www.teenvogue.com/story/how-to-keep-messages-secure)

A great post from [Nicole Kobie](https://twitter.com/njkobie) at [Teen Vogue](http://www.teenvogue.com/). This post provides clear advice on keeping your messages secure. The piece begins with the premise that you might be at a protest, or concerned about the political leanings of your parents. It goes on to indicate that SMS and Snapchat aren't exactly the safest methods to use and protect your communications.

One of the key apps that they suggest is [Signal](https://whispersystems.org/), which [I've discussed here](http://wiobyrne.com/imho/2016/signal) in the past.

I'm excited with some of the recent reporting that Teen Vogue has been sharing. I'm also thrilled to see that they're informing readers to be more critical users of technology.

### [Psychology journal editor asked to resign for refusing to review papers unless he can see the data](https://boingboing.net/2017/03/02/psychology-journal-editor-aske.html)

A fascinating story that unpacks many of the challenges and opportunities involved in research and scholarship. Psychologist Gert Storms indicated that he [would no longer review journal submissions for publication](http://www.nature.com/news/peer-review-activists-push-psychology-journals-towards-open-data-1.21549#/b1) if the authors did not supply their data.

This is a test of the [Peer Reviewers' Open Initiative](https://opennessinitiative.org/the-initiative/) (PRO Initiative). This initiative strives for openness and transparency in science and research. The hope is that through the examination of not just the manuscript, but also the data involved, the field can comprehensively review presented materials.

I share much of this thinking as I explore and promote open scholarship in my research. It often requires rethinking issues of privacy and security as we make sure that we protect research subjects while ensuring validity. I also think it's important for researchers to make science and research a bit more understandable and open for all to interpret.

### [Three myths about "reading levels"](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/reading-minds/201702/three-myths-about-reading-levels)

A post from [Paula Schwanenflugel](https://coe.uga.edu/directory/profiles/pschwan) and [Nancy Knapp](https://coe.uga.edu/directory/profiles/nfknapp) in Psychology Today looking at three myths about reading levels and why not to fall for them.

Schwanenflugel and Knapp indicate that we should not be fooled by the following:

- Each text has a discrete, accurately measurable reading level
- Each reader has a discrete, accurately measurable level of reading skill
- Readers should (almost always) read texts very near their reading level

### [School reading tests could include emoji, says assessment chief](http://thenewdaily.com.au/news/national/2017/03/01/school-reading-tests-emoji/)

As we examine literacy activities, there are some times when "non-traditional" forms of reading and writing are included in instruction. This might include considerations of coding/programming when learning about the writing process. This also may include the use and/or creation of emoji as students engage with texts.

I think this post on emoji being included in a reading test is an example of a [Rorschach Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rorschach_test) to see how individuals view these discussions and their impact on the classroom. I think the earlier post on open scholarship and publishing is another example of this as it immediately stirs up a reaction to see what philosophical leanings one might have on the topic.

I'm excited to see the inclusion of emoji in these assessments. I think it provides another form of communication that students may use to extend comprehension.

## 🔨 Do

### [Google's Keep is now an excellent sidekick to its productivity apps](https://thenextweb.com/apps/2017/03/01/googles-keep-now-excellent-sidekick-productivity-apps/)

As I migrate away from Evernote, I've been increasingly using [Google Keep](https://keep.google.com/) to keep track of notes. I use the app on my phone to record audio notes of things that I want to remember. Keep transcribes my voice notes to make it easier to use them. I also save quick notes and ideas in Keep and treat these notes as virtual post-it notes that live in the cloud. As I use these notes, I archive them in case I need it later.

In a recent update, Keep has been added into Google Docs. This allows me to open up a sidebar in a Google Doc, and pull up all of my Keep notes. You can then drag the note over to the Google Doc and it will automatically paste the content into your Google Doc. This is a powerful tool to use in researching and writing.
