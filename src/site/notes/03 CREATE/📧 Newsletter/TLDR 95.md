# TLDR 95

## Too Long; Didn't Read Issue 95

**Published**: 2017-04-29 • [[03 CREATE/📧 Newsletter/📧 Newsletter\|📧 Newsletter]]

Welcome to issue #95 of TL;DR. This is a weekly synthesis of things you need to know about education, technology, and literacy. Feel free to share with someone that you believe would benefit. [Subscribe](http://wiobyrne.us11.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=7b5ee323a16720dad25ff96ff&id=17e92a2ae1) to this newsletter if you haven't already.

In this week's episode we come to terms with curiosity.

This week I spent some time with my friends at the [SC Virtual Charter School](http://scvcs.k12.com/). I love working with this group because they're always actively trying to figure out how to engage students in digital learning spaces. I presented some of my thoughts on [virtual field trips](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17jcMYF582XTtdpOdoZBbVJ5p5GGt6tOL4_k3bMFAJ14/edit#slide=id.p). I'll have a full post on this soon.

Please get in touch with me at hello@wiobyrne.com. You can review [archives of the newsletter](http://us11.campaign-archive1.com/home/?u=7b5ee323a16720dad25ff96ff&id=17e92a2ae1) or on [Medium](https://medium.com/tldr-newsletter). I also share the quotes at the bottom of the newsletter on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/wiobyrne/).

### [The fight for net neutrality is officially back on](https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/26/15439622/fcc-net-neutrality-internet-freedom-isp-ajit-pai)

The fight for Internet freedoms continues. This latest threat is a retread of an issue that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and Internet service providers (ISPs) have been trying to push for years. The challenge is that the term "[net neutrality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality)" is a horrible title that is even harder to understand. Let's make it a bit simpler so you can understand what it is...and why you need to fight.

Net neutrality requires ISPs to treat all content equitably. This is the belief that bits of information online are all equal. This means that your ISP cannot decide to privilege one piece of content over another by making it free or faster online. Bits are bits. They should all be free and equal online.

[Educate yourself about net neutrality](https://gizmodo.com/how-to-explain-net-neutrality-to-your-relatives-a-than-1662879757). Then [head over to the EFF](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/04/fcc-announces-plan-abandon-net-neutrality-and-isp-privacy) to learn how to take action.

### [Will you graduate? Ask big data](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/02/education/edlife/will-you-graduate-ask-big-data.html)

An intriguing piece in the [NY Times](http://www.nytimes.com/) from [Joseph B. Treaster](https://twitter.com/josephbtreaster) that uses "big data" to examine graduate rates in Georgia State's nursing school. [Big data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data) is a term given to the large volume of structured and unstructured data that our organizations pump out on a daily basis. Recent attempts are being made in the field to analyze these data sorts to make better decisions.

In this piece, the success or failure of the majority of students in the program came down to their performance in an introductory math course.

This piece has me wondering about those possible keystone learning experiences that serve as an essential foundation for later success.

### [Purdue buys Kaplan University, will create new nonprofit chain](https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2017/04/27/purdue-buys-kaplan-university-will-create-new-nonprofit-chain?utm_source=ihe&utm_medium=editorial-site&utm_content=breakingnews)

In an entrepreneurial power move, Purdue University, a public research university, is buying Kaplan University, a large for-profit chain with a mostly online base.

The plan is to create [a new nonprofit institution](http://www.purduenewu.org/) which will offer a variety of credentials and certificates online and at campus locations.

I'm still trying to unpack this and will be interested to see how things shake out. For now, please check out some early feedback [from Audrey Watters](http://network.hackeducation.com/2017/04/27/kaplan) and [Inside Higher Ed](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/04/28/purdue-acquires-kaplan-university-create-new-public-online-university-under-purdue).

### [When a college degree isn't enough](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2017/04/when-a-college-degree-isnt-enough/524553/)

This is a market that I don't think enough people are paying attention to as we look to the future of education. We see the reports that indicate that students graduate from K-12 and/or higher education and are not prepared to do much in the business or workforce. Students are increasingly searching out extra credentials, "lightweight" credentials to set themselves out from others in the hiring pool.

This could be taking coding classes at a local training center, or completing online certification courses. These courses could cost tens of thousands of dollars, or they could be free. These courses and credentialing programs also offer an expedited path to knowledge that is shorter, and more relevant than the years of instruction required in traditional programs.

Something to keep an eye on for a variety of reasons. If education, and specifically higher ed is being disrupted...I think the possible future is evident in paths like this.

### [Can digital literacy be deconstructed into learnable units?](http://literaci.es/deconstructed-units)

A great post from good friend [Doug Belshaw](https://twitter.com/dajbelshaw) in which he breaks down the possible components in becoming digitally literate.

Belshaw unpacks his thinking regarding the following four prompts:

- What are the biggest mistakes novices make when becoming digitally literate?
- What mistakes are common at a pro level?
- Can you learn the building blocks of digital literacy without access to the web? What would be the biggest misuse of time?
- What are your favorite instructional books or resources on digital literacies? If people were to teach themselves what would you suggest they use?

## 🔨 Do

### [GE Teach Tour Builder - Create Google Earth Tours for the web](http://www.freetech4teachers.com/2017/04/ge-teach-tour-builder-create-google.html)

In the workshops I presented on virtual field trips, I spent much of my time focusing on the new [Google Earth](https://www.google.com/earth/) before heading into a discussion about AR/VR and [Google Expeditions](https://edu.google.com/expeditions/).

I came home from this session, and this post from [Richard Byrne](https://twitter.com/rmbyrne) popped up in my feed. Byrne shares a great [video overview of the new Google Earth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EhmCznFRis) as well as guidance on GE Teach Tour. I wish that I would have seen this before I conducted the session. :)

GE Teach Tour will allow you to create and publish tours to view in the new web version of Google Earth. This allows you to create an updated version of the [Google Lit Trips](http://www.googlelittrips.org/) that I've used a lot in the past.
