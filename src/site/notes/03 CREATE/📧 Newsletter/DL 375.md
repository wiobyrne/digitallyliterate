## 📚 This Week’s Highlights

### 1. **JuMBOs: A New Astronomical Discovery**
In high-resolution imagery of the Orion Nebula, scientists discovered Jupiter Mass Binary Objects (JuMBOs), a smaller class of gaseous objects. While brown dwarfs grow to about 13 times the mass of Jupiter, JuMBOs are as small as half Jupiter's mass and orbit each other at an incredible distance.

**Why this matters:** This discovery challenges our understanding of planetary formation and star systems. [Learn more](https://www.nytimes.com/2023-10-02/science/orion-nebula-webb-planets.html).

### 2. **PRIME Algorithms & Misinformation**
Social media platforms amplify content to maximize engagement, often leading to social misperceptions, polarization, and misinformation. Algorithms prioritize prestigious, in-group, moral, and emotional (PRIME) information over factual accuracy.

📖 [Read more about PRIME engagement](https://theconversation.com/social-media-algorithms-warp-how-people-learn-from-each-other-research-shows-211172)

**Why this matters:** Better algorithm design is needed to align human psychology with accurate social learning.

### 3. **AI's Role in Repression**
Freedom House’s latest report reveals how advances in AI increase the efficiency of digital repression, spreading disinformation and evading regulatory scrutiny.

**Why this matters:** Without regulatory action, the power of AI to influence and manipulate grows unchecked.

---

### 4. **23andMe Genetic Privacy Breach**
Hackers used stolen credentials to scrape genetic data from millions of 23andMe accounts. This breach highlights critical issues in genetic privacy and security.

📖 [Learn about the breach](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/genetics-firm-23andme-says-user-data-stolen-in-credential-stuffing-attack/)

**Why this matters:** What steps can individuals and companies take to ensure genetic data remains private?

---

### 5. **Book Bans & Censorship**
The surge in book bans across the U.S. is tied to BookLooks.org, a site connected to Moms for Liberty. Despite claims of neutrality, BookLooks reviews have fueled efforts to remove books, particularly those addressing LGBTQ+ issues and racism.

📖 [Explore the rise of book bans](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2023-10-05/website-driving-banned-books-surge-moms-for-liberty/70922213007/)

**Why this matters:** Understanding the tactics behind censorship helps combat the suppression of critical knowledge.

### 6. **Reflections on Fahrenheit 451**
danah boyd examines how Ray Bradbury’s _Fahrenheit 451_ critiques censorship and the role of screens in society.

📖 [Read danah boyd’s analysis](http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2023-09-26/the-screens-are-the-symptom.html)

**Why this matters:** Beyond the visible consequences of repression, Bradbury prompts us to question the underlying societal conditions that enable it.

## 🛠️ DO: Overcome Self-Doubt

If you're stuck ruminating on past mistakes, try these practical strategies:
1. **Cognitive defusion:** Recognize thoughts for what they are, not as reflections of reality.
2. **Self-compassion:** Replace shame with empathy for yourself.
3. **Strategic writing:** Journaling about your feelings can help process and release them.
