** Too Long; Didn't Read (TL;DR) newsletter #37

------------------------------------------------------------

Hi all. Welcome to the TL;DR Newsletter. This week we'll discuss sarcasm, emoticons, & rogue researchers.

If a good friend shared this newsletter, you might want to subscribe (http://wiobyrne.us11.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=7b5ee323a16720dad25ff96ff&id=17e92a2ae1) ...I'll make sure you cut to the front of the line for next week's issue.

And now..the updates. This week I shared the following:

* What is Blockchain? (http://wiobyrne.com/what-is-blockchain/) - I've been meaning to write this post for a long time. It's mainly a way to better understand blockchain technologies. I also wanted to put a primer out for people that might be trying to understand our work in BadgeChain (https://medium.com/badge-chain) .

* Why in the world would you want to develop a Massive Open, Online Course (MOOC)? (http://wiobyrne.com/why-in-the-world-would-you-want-to-develop-a-massive-open-online-course-mooc/) - This post shares materials from a presentation this week at the Addlestone Library at CofC. I detail the elements I see in MOOCs, and identify work I've conducted over the years developing and facilitating these open learning experiences.

* I applied to present at TEDx Charleston (http://wiobyrne.com/imho/2016/application-submitted-for-tedx-charleston-now-we-wait) - Who knows what I was thinking. :) You can review my materials and thinking here (http://wiobyrne.com/imho/2016/march-17-2016) .

* Interview with Kurt Becker (http://wiobyrne.com/imho/2016/interview-with-kurt-becker-about-engineering-education-design-stem-literacy) - I conducted an interview with Kurt discussing engineering, STEM, design, and literacy for Literacy Beat. It was a ton of fun and has me thinking about new opportunities.

* W (http://walkmy.world/start-walking/walk2016/le8/) here I'm going (http://walkmy.world/start-walking/walk2016/le8/)  - This week we launched Learning Event 8 in #WalkMyWorld 2016. We're about halfway through the #WalkMyWorld Project 2016. Take a look at the post and come join us online.

Last Week with John Oliver on Encryption

This video is NSFW and contains bad words.

Great overview (18:00) by John Oliver in which he provides a fantastic synthesis of the current encryption debate...and why you should care.

Oliver is a master in humor, satire, and presenting the pain points in an easy to understand format.

## 📚 Read

** Handful of biologists went rogue and published directly to the Internet (http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/16/science/asap-bio-biologists-published-to-the-internet.html?_r=0)

Thoroughly fascinating story of researchers and academics in biology that are openly posting research online under the hashtag #ASAPbio.

Over the past three weeks I've presented various session about open learning, publishing, and access. In each of these talks I've encountered some push back about the "why" of doing this. The real key for them seems to be about time and the amount that it will take to openly publish and share these materials.

My advice is that you don't really need to do anything to add time. You need to think about working differently and utilizing different tools. As an example, use Google Slides as opposed to Powerpoint and share those materials openly online. Work different. Work smarter.

** Five facts about Twitter at age 10 (http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/03/18/5-facts-about-twitter-at-age-10/)

Themes identified from the ** Pew Research Center (http://www.pewresearch.org/)

as Twitter turns 10.

* Twitter's user base has grown rapidly but may be plateauing.

* Twitter is largely global service.

* There are ** six basic types of Twitter conversations (http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/02/20/the-six-types-of-twitter-conversations/)

(polarized crowds, tight crowds, brand clusters, community clusters, broadcast networks, and support networks).

* The twitterverse doesn't always mirror the real world.

* Twitter can be valuable in emergencies.

** Sarcasm in Written Communication: Emoticons are efficient markers of intention (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jcc4.12156/abstract;jsessionid=B9E37B6694BADF8DCC5F3F97BB6D0B57.f04t03)

Overview of two studies in the Journal of Computer Mediated Communication looking at sarcasm in written communication and the intersection of emoticons. Findings highlight significant role emoticons play in clarifying message intention, compensating for the absence of nonverbal cues in written communication.

** How podcasts can make you a better teacher (http://ditchthattextbook.com/2014/05/29/how-podcasts-can-make-you-a-better-teacher/)

I love podcasts.

Podcasts are basically shows that you would listen to on the radio in the past. Through the use of technology, we can save these shows on devices, and listen to them on our schedule. Through the advance of technology, now anyone can make and share their own shows.

If you're looking for some podcasts to get you started, I recommend ** Hardcore History (http://www.dancarlin.com/hardcore-history-series/)

, ** Today in Digital Education, (http://tidepodcast.org/)

and the ** Tim Ferriss show (http://fourhourworkweek.com/podcast/)

.

** Taking back control of the web: an easy way to host and run secure open source apps  (http://dougbelshaw.com/blog/2016/03/17/sandstorm/)

** Sandstorm.io (https://sandstorm.io/)

is a very intriguing series of apps, or grains that you can run online. The suite of tools ranges from alternatives for Trello, Evernote, Slack, and beyond. Basically it means that you're running your own versions of the tools that you control.

I'm really excited that Doug is spending some time investigating this and look forward to hearing his results. I'll start playing around with them as well to see what happens.

## 🔨 Do

** Set expirations dates for access to Google Drive, Docs, Sheets, and Slides (http://googleappsupdates.blogspot.co.uk/2016/03/set-expiration-dates-for-access-to.html)

This feature is being added to Google Apps and will allow you to set an "expiration date" for materials that you share online with others.

I frequently share materials online with others. I don't know if I'll utilize this. One thing I may try is setting an expiration date for a year for materials openly shared online. The thought process is that I'll remove some old materials and information that I share online as my thoughts, ideas, and materials change.

## 🤔 Consider

If you have the words, there's always a chance that you'll find the way.
