## 🛡️ Seeking Accountability in AI

The [White House Executive Order on AI](https://datasociety.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=00b33d1beca407762446037f0&id=3a3ed20dd9&e=7f021e3135) prioritizes protecting rights and addressing harms from AI. It aligns with the [Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights](https://datasociety.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=00b33d1beca407762446037f0&id=a1fba3dab5&e=7f021e3135) and includes:
- Guidance on ethical AI deployment.
- Measures for addressing algorithmic risks.

**Why this matters:** The order is a promising step, but implementing its ambitious goals requires urgent resource allocation.
