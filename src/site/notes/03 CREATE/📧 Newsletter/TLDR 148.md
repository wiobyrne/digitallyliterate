** Too Long; Didn't Read (TL;DR) newsletter #148

------------------------------------------------------------

TL;DR is a summary of all the great stuff from the Internet this week in technology, education, and literacy. Welcome to Issue #148. Responsibility equals accountability equals ownership.

This week I posted the following:

* Switching up my signals (https://wiobyrne.com/switching-up-my-signals/) - I'm choosing not to delete Facebook. Instead I'm testing an opportunity to use my Indie Web philosophies, while being more intentional in what I share online. The result after two weeks is that I'm not sharing/tweeting as much each day. This will most likely balance out after I get my processes sorted. I am continuing to catch everything in this newsletter.

* Practicing what you preach (https://wiobyrne.com/practicing-what-you-preach/) - A post drawing a couple of threads together from Brene’ Brown to Seneca to help you think about aspirational values as opposed to practiced values.

* Video: Using Google Drive to store, organize, & share your stuff (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSyltw7yCGI) - A quick video overview of how I use Google Drive.

* Video: Four questions for Tim Huey about vigilance & remaining safe in schools (https://youtu.be/zc7V1zHxuKc) - This video is a follow-up to the earlier video (https://youtu.be/cc9R_68kTFI) about safety in critical, dangerous school situations. Please take the time to view, or share with educators and parents. Be safe.

** en & The Art of Making Coffee (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUeQNiXk0pQ)

Videos from ** Matt D'Avella (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ24N4O0bP7LGLBDvye7oCA)

started hitting my YouTube feed hard this week. I watched a couple of his videos (all about minimalism, filmmaking, creativity), liked them, and subscribed to his channel.

This video is a good overview of how to make coffee "for normal people." There is some focus on the tips of the pros....and some bad words. But, all in all, it's a good way to think about brewing yourself a really great cup of coffee on the weekend.

** Who should hold the keys to our data? (http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/29/in-charge-our-own-data-personal-information-facebook-scandal)

An interesting look at the reinvigorated debate around ownership of our data and digital identity. Even as recent revelations reignited debates about ownership of our details, open data elsewhere could be a force for good.

The question we need to ask:

Politicians, entrepreneurs, academics, even bureaucrats spend an awful lot of time these days lecturing each other about data. There is big data, personal data, open data, aggregate data and anonymized data. Each variety has issues: where does it originate? Who owns it? What it is worth?

** Declining majority of online adults say the Internet has been good for society (http://www.pewinternet.org/2018/04/30/declining-majority-of-online-adults-say-the-internet-has-been-good-for-society/)

An interesting trend has been popping up over the last couple of months. Despite the fact that the Internet and other communication technologies impact our lives in a variety of (mostly positive) ways, news from recent fields has been rather tepid. Put simply, people seem to be bored with the Internet and digital tools. Headlines appear like: ** We were promised mind-blowing personal tech...what's the hold-up? (https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/we-were-promised-mind-blowing-personal-tech-whats-the-hold-up-1525356604)

This research report from Pew suggests that American adults suggest that these online spaces provide a mixed blessing for society.

Perhaps there is also some lag as we unpack more privacy and security concerns as identified in the Facebook/Cambridge Analytica revelations. And perhaps...since most adults consider the Internet to just be Facebook...perhaps they're expecting more.

** Algorithmic Accountability: A Primer (https://datasociety.net/output/algorithmic-accountability-a-primer/)

Big decisions about people’s lives are increasingly made by software systems and algorithms. This primer explores issues of algorithmic accountability, or the process of assigning responsibility for harm when algorithmic decision-making results in discriminatory and inequitable outcomes.

There are few consumer or civil rights protections that limit the types of data used to build data profiles or that require the auditing of algorithmic decision-making, even though algorithmic systems can make decisions on the basis of protected attributes like race, income, or gender.

This brief explores the trade-offs between and debates about algorithms and accountability across several key ethical dimensions, including:

* Fairness and bias;

* Opacity and transparency;

* The repurposing of data and algorithms;

* Lack of standards for auditing

* Power and control; and

* Trust and expertise.

** Teaching to the tech (https://dogtrax.edublogs.org/2018/05/02/teaching-to-the-tech/)

Friend of the Internet, ** Kevin Hodgson (https://twitter.com/dogtrax)

shared out this post in which he reflects on the challenges and opportunities as his students prepare for some of the new, online state tests.

Hodgson notes:

There are also some questions where answer options can get dragged around the page, and I had few questions related to that (it wasn’t on the practice test), which makes me wonder how I might do some work with this (and think: paper cut-outs, perhaps, and manually manipulating chunks of text). I could only point them to the directions for the activity.

One of the biggest challenges, I think, is the planning of the longer essays and narrative stories. I teach graphic organizers all year long and my students work with them for pre-writing all year long. And they have blank paper to use for the test, for graphic organizers or notes.

I definitely agree with this assessment. In the work/development we conducted while researching at UConn, we (** Greg (https://twitter.com/jgmac1106)

and I) indicated the need for panels or sections in the online assessments. We need an interface that breaks up the information consumption space into several areas...like you see in video editing software. Have one panel for the main text that students read. Have a secondary panel or space for notes, annotations, copy/paste. And then a third space for the actual answer. Students can work the tool, as they work the system.

Obviously this is not how most people consume the Internet, but they should. And...this is not how the assessments are constructed...but they should be.

** In high school, the kids are not all right (https://www.edutopia.org/article/high-school-kids-are-not-all-right)

This past week I was chatting with some colleagues about the general state of mind of our students as they enter the final, clinical teaching phase of the program. You would think that they're super excited to work in a school everyday, but what we're noticing is that they're super stressed out. These observations tend to be noticed by some other research in the field.

This piece by ** David Tow (https://twitter.com/dandrewt)

in Edutopia looks at the social and academic pressures kids feel in high school, and opportunities to help them cope.

Tow provides the following strategies for promoting high schoolers mental well-being:

* Ask “How are you doing?”—and mean it.

* Set office hours.

* Remember your Maslow.

* Consider what matters.

* Use the professionals.

## 🔨 Do

A piece in the Harvard Business Review that reminds us about the possibilities that open up when we reframe our use of language.

Approaching problems with a “should” mindset gets us stuck on the trade-off the choice entails and narrows our thinking on one answer, the one that seems most obvious. But when we think in terms of “could,” we stay open-minded and the trade-offs involved inspire us to come up with creative solutions.

## 🤔 Consider

If I were dropped out of a plane into the ocean and told the nearest land was a thousand miles away, I'd still swim. And I'd despise the one who gave up.

― Abraham Maslow
