TL;DR #184 - 2/9/2019

Hi all, welcome to TL;DR. My name is Ian O’Byrne (https://wiobyrne.com/start/) . I research, teach, & write about technology in our lives. I try to synthesize what happened this week in tech…so you can be the expert as well. We’ll have some changes upcoming for this newsletter to help achieve these goals. :)

I posted a couple of things this week:

* Help Define Digital Literacy (https://wiobyrne.com/define-digital-literacy/) - Make your voice heard, and help us revise/rewrite the definitions of digital literacy. Alternatively, you could also go directly to the discussion held here on Flipgrid (https://flipgrid.com/definedigital) .

* No real association between adolescent well-being and digital technology use (https://screentime.me/adolescent-well-being/) - A new paper (https://www.amyorben.com/publication/2019_orbenprzybylski_nhb/) examines the widespread speculation around the connections between the use of digital tech by adolescents & psychological well-being.

* Setting up your first assignment face-to-face in class using Peergrade (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTa8PJ49ZAE&t=3s) - A quick overview of how I use Peergrade as an activity in class to work through the process and expectations of peer evaluation and assessment.

## 📺 Watch

------------------------------------------------------------

I love watching MKBHD (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBJycsmduvYEL83R_U4JriQ) to see what apps and tools he’s using on a regular basis. I’d like to put one of these videos together to share my processes and platforms.

## 📚 Read

------------------------------------------------------------

Spotify (https://www.spotify.com/us/) made some big news this week with their purchase of Gimlet and Anchor. Gimlet (https://www.gimletmedia.com/) is an award-winning podcast studio. Anchor is a great tool/platform to allow you to create and share a podcast.

This is big news in the online spac (https://www.recode.net/2019/2/7/18214941/alex-blumberg-matt-lieber-gimlet-spotify-deal-acquisition-peter-kafka-media-podcast-audio-interview) e as more and more individuals are listening to, and creating podcasts. I’m thinking that this is a play for Spotify as they try to become the audio equivalent of YouTube. I can see Spotify creating a space where you can find music and playlists, but more importantly high-quality, and user-generated content in the form of audio podcasts. So…just the way that I can upload/record/share video on YouTube…I can log in to Spotify and upload/record/share my audio podcast. Brilliant.

** Close the Digital Generation Gap, Unlock the Power of Online Affinity Networks, and Fuel Learning (https://clalliance.org/blog/close-the-digital-generation-gap-unlock-the-power-of-online-affinity-networks-and-fuel-learning/)

------------------------------------------------------------

Following in the footsteps of Hanging Out, Messing Around, and Geeking Out: Kids Living and Learning with New Media (https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/hanging-out-messing-around-and-geeking-out) (HOMAGO), Affinity Online: How Connection and Shared Interest Fuel Learning (https://clalliance.org/publications/affinity-online-how-connection-and-shared-interest-fuel-learning/) , a book synthesizing research by the Leveling Up team of the Connected Learning Research Network.

Like HOMAGO, Affinity Online is a multi-year, multi-investigator effort, grounded in ethnographic case studies of youth online engagement. It offers a textured and in-depth look into a delightful diversity of youth online affinity networks to consider how young people have found new opportunities for expanded learning in the digital age.

** How Silicon Valley puts the “con” in consent (https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/02/opinion/internet-facebook-google-consent.html)

------------------------------------------------------------

Simple question from the NY Times Editorial Board. If no one reads the terms and conditions for the apps, platforms, and spaces we use on a daily basis…how can they continue to be the legal backbone of the Internet?

The average person would have to spend 76 working days (https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/03/reading-the-privacy-policies-you-encounter-in-a-year-would-take-76-work-days/253851/) reading all of the digital privacy policies they agree to in the span of a year. Reading Amazon’s terms and conditions alone out loud takes approximately nine hours (https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/9/16620452/london-glass-room-art-exhibit) .

Why would anyone read the terms of service when they don’t feel as though they have a choice in the first place? It’s not as though a user can call up Mark Zuckerberg and negotiate his or her own privacy policy. The “I agree” button should have long ago been renamed “Meh, whatever.”

** There’s no good reason to trust blockchain technology (https://www.wired.com/story/theres-no-good-reason-to-trust-blockchain-technology/)

------------------------------------------------------------

Bruce Schneier (https://www.schneier.com/) is an internationally renowned expert on security technologies. His opinions are a mandatory read for me as I consume, curate, and create in digital spaces.

This this post from Wired, Schneier discusses the many reasons we should not implicitly trust the technology behind the blockchain, and derivative technologies.

Read a bit more (https://opensource.com/article/19/2/blockchain-open-source-communities) about commonalities that blockchain technologies have with open source communities in establishing trust.

** The political case for more free time (https://theoutline.com/post/7050/burnout-generation-more-free-time?zd=2&zi=jcdu2mna)

------------------------------------------------------------

Several weeks ago in TL;DR, I shared because a viral essay for BuzzFeed from Anne Helen Petersen that focused on how we’re the burnout generation (https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/annehelenpetersen/millennials-burnout-generation-debt-work) .

This piece from Matt Hartman (http://themhartman.com/) in The Outline extends from this framing to indicate that our jobs suck, and we should spend less time thinking about them.

As a corollary to this piece, check out Let Children Get Bored Again (https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/02/opinion/sunday/children-bored.html) from Pamela Paul.

## 🔨 Do

------------------------------------------------------------

The incredible Bryan Mathers (https://bryanmmathers.com/) released another tool on his awesome Remixer Machine (https://remixer.visualthinkery.com/) . The Pixel-8 tool is a fun way to upload an image and play with it a bit. You’ll also find a lot of other great tools to play with on the machine.

## 🤔 Consider
