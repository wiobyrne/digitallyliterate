### [Australia is Becoming a Surveillance State](https://ia.acs.org.au/article/2021/australia-is-becoming-a-surveillance-state.html)
The [Surveillance Legislation Amendment (Identify and Disrupt) Bill 2020](https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/about-us/our-portfolios/national-security/lawful-access-telecommunications/surveillance-legislation-amendment-identify-and-disrupt-bill-2020) grants Australian Federal Police and Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission three unprecedented powers:

1. **Data disruption warrant**: Authority to modify, copy, add, or delete digital data
2. **Network activity warrant**: Permission to collect intelligence from devices and networks
3. **Account takeover warrant**: Power to control online accounts for investigation purposes

This legislation represents a significant expansion of digital surveillance capabilities, raising critical questions about privacy rights and democratic oversight in the digital age.

### [The New Puritans](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/08/new-puritans-shame-authoritarianism/619818/)
The piece examines how intellectual discourse has become constrained by fear of social media backlash. A particularly striking observation emerges:

*"How much intellectual life is now stifled because of fear of what a poorly worded comment would look like if taken out of context and spread on Twitter?"*

While "Twitter is not real life" for most people, the silencing effect on public discourse deserves attention. At the core lies the complex challenge of guaranteeing equal outcomes for all individuals—a more nuanced problem than many acknowledge.

One quote stands out particularly:

*"I think people's tolerance for discomfort—people's tolerance for dissonance, for not hearing exactly what they want to hear—has now gone down to zero. Discomfort used to be a term of praise about pedagogy—I mean, the greatest discomforter of all was Socrates."*

The brilliance of culture wars lies in their magnetic pull—we can't help but engage, making it an effective strategy for group cohesion and enemy identification.

### [On Mirrors, Windows, and Telescopes](https://library.ncte.org/journals/CC/issues/v31-1/31377)
[Stephanie Toliver](https://readingblackfutures.com/) brilliantly extends Dr. Rudine Sims Bishop's literary metaphor, adding a crucial new dimension. While Bishop's original framework explored how books serve as mirrors (reflecting readers' experiences), windows (offering views of other worlds), and sliding glass doors (enabling entry into authored worlds), Toliver adds telescopes:

*"Through telescopes, children—especially those whose access to futures and fantasies has been distorted by violence and oppression—will be able to see that those futuristic and fantastical landscapes are actually closer than they first appeared to be."*

This addition provides essential hope for marginalized children, helping them envision futures and possibilities that extend beyond their immediate circumstances.

### [Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Resources for Teaching About Digital Culture](https://edspace.american.edu/deicomm365/)
A comprehensive resource offering insights from thought leaders, books, articles, videos, and podcasts covering:

- [Basics of Digital Culture](https://edspace.american.edu/deicomm365/basics-of-digital-culture/)
- [Power, Privacy, & Politics](https://edspace.american.edu/deicomm365/power-privacy-politics/)
- [Digital Networks & Communities](https://edspace.american.edu/deicomm365/digital-communities/)

These resources equip educators to foster inclusive and critical conversations about digital literacy and cultural awareness.

### [Why We Shout During an Argument (and Why It's Not Effective)](https://lifehacker.com/why-we-shout-during-an-argument-and-why-its-not-effect-1847588343)
Vanessa Bohns, Cornell University professor of organizational behavior, offers insight from a recent [Wall Street Journal article](https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-do-we-shout-when-we-argue-lack-of-confidence-11629518461):

*"While we often are overconfident in our beliefs, the tendency to shout—whether over our neighbors, friends, or adversaries—comes from underconfidence in our ability to convince others."*

Effective alternatives to shouting include:
- **Pointing out disconnects** between what people think/say versus what they do
- **Asking thoughtful questions** to encourage articulation and engagement with topics
- **Gentle persuasion** through empathy and understanding

## 🔨 Do

### Navigate COVID News Without Spiraling
[MIT Technology Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021-08-30/1033929/how-to-navigate-covid-news-without-spiraling/) suggests these strategies:

- **Beware sensationalized headlines** - Look beyond "scariant" terminology
- **Accept information evolution** - Understand that scientific knowledge develops over time
- **Focus on actionable updates** - Prioritize relevant, practical information over anxiety-inducing speculation

## 🤔 Consider

### The problem is not people being uneducated. The problem is that people are educated just enough to believe what they have been taught, and not educated enough to question anything from what they have been taught.
*Richard Feynman*

This observation perfectly captures the challenge explored throughout this issue: our declining tolerance for intellectual discomfort. Whether discussing cancel culture, surveillance expansion, or persuasion techniques, the common thread involves our relationship with uncertainty and questioning. Feynman's insight reminds us that true education involves cultivating comfort with discomfort—the ability to sit with questions, contradictions, and evolving understanding.
