Hi all, welcome to issue 240 of Digitally Literate.

Over the last couple of weeks, I've talked about the [Online Learning Collective Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/onlinelearningcollective/) that I helped found. As of this morning, there are almost 25,000 members in the group.

This week we shifted gears as we re-branded as the [Higher Ed Learning Collective](https://higheredlearningcollective.org/) to better differentiate the name of the group. You can follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/HigherEdLC) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/HigherEdLC/).

I also helped post the following this week:

- [Mental & Physical Health During Increased Screentime](https://screentime.me/mental-physical-health-with-increased-screentime/) - In this episode of the [Technopanic Podcast](https://screentime.me/technopanic-podcast/), Kristen and I talk with Paul Weigle, M.D., a Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist at Natchaug Hospital.
- [Overwhelmed with gratitude: Tips for educators and families during COVID-19](https://literacy6-12.org/gratitude/) - First post by [Chanda Jefferson](https://twitter.com/MsJScienceGEEKs) for our Literacy in the Disciplines research group blog.

[Dr. Jeffrey VanWingen](https://www.drjeffvw.com/) on how to shop safely and bring things into your house.

**Important corrections to the video**: CDC recommends cloth masks in public (April 3, 2020). Rinse fruits and vegetables with water—no soap. NIH data suggests COVID-19 lives on cardboard for 1 day. Perishable foods like meat should be brought in and refrigerated; only disinfect outside packaging.

Please also review this [guidance on disinfectants](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/index.html).

## 📚 Read

### [The Fog of Pandemic](https://www.nytimes.com/)

We've grown accustomed to living through an information war fought largely by hardened political operatives and trolls.

While the coronavirus crisis is political and will continue to be politicized, its most consequential fights will take place in the "fog of pandemic" where so much of our data—from health statistics to economic indicators—is flawed or evolving. Today's propaganda could be tomorrow's truth. Or vice versa. Even the good guys are working with limited information and hoping for the best. We are not prepared for what's coming.

As this information spreads, [cell phone data shows people are not social distancing](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/02/us/coronavirus-social-distancing.html), especially in [certain regions of the U.S.](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/04/coronavirus-unique-threat-south-young-people/609241/)

### [How to Talk With Kids About Screentime and COVID-19](https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21201807/children-adolescents-screentime-coronavirus-how-to-psychiatrist)

There is discussion that the [screentime debate has ended, and screens won](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/31/technology/coronavirus-screen-time.html). I don't entirely agree with this, but I have been more thoughtful about our use of screens as we adapt. I reflect on this regularly in our [Technopanic Podcast](https://screentime.me/technopanic-podcast/). Please don't let it [interfere with sleep patterns](https://www.edutopia.org/article/pediatricians-balancing-screen-time-sleep-and-family-during-coronavirus).

It's important to recognize that youth are trying to make sense of these contexts and practices. If you're looking for guidance, this resource from [Learning in Places](http://learninginplaces.org/for-families/) is excellent.

### [Feminist Pedagogy in a Time of Coronavirus Pandemic](https://femtechnet.org/feminist-pedagogy-in-a-time-of-coronavirus-pandemic/)

This great resource from the [FemTechNet network](https://femtechnet.org/about/the-network/) focuses not on HOW to teach classes online, but how to do this WELL—thoughtfully and with principles, and with the support at hand.

FemTechNet shares how they've learned to make digital learning work well after 8 years of working together as teachers, scholars, students, artists, technologists, and feminists.

### [Academia in the Time of COVID-19: Our Chance to Develop an Ethics of Care](http://www.laseg.cat/en/news/22/academia-in-the-time-of-covid-19-our-chance-to-develop-an-ethics-of-care)

This document from LASEG (Laboratory for the Analysis of Social-Ecological Systems in a Globalised world) examines how academics may shape our ethos of work now and in the future.

If you wish to add your name as additional signatory and expand the views expressed, [please do so here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QXGxjVMzBBfCvdG2WoeqDwg-rCcJsEFN_Rxs373a5KA/edit?usp=sharing). With contributions, they may work towards a Global Manifesto on Academic Praxis during and after COVID-19.

### ['Zoombombing' Is a Federal Offense That Could Result in Imprisonment](https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/3/21207260/zoombombing-crime-zoom-video-conference-hacking-pranks-doj-fbi)

[Zoombombing](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/technology/zoom-harassment-abuse-racism-fbi-warning.html) is when someone successfully invades a public or sometimes even private meeting over the videoconferencing platform to broadcast shock videos, pornography, or other disruptive content.

This happened to a couple of my colleagues this week.

Prosecutors say they'll pursue charges including "disrupting a public meeting, computer intrusion, using a computer to commit a crime, hate crimes, fraud, or transmitting threatening communications." Some charges include fines and possible imprisonment.

If you or anyone you know becomes a victim, report it to the [FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center](https://www.ic3.gov/default.aspx).

## 🔨 Do

### [Make and Wear a Cloth Face Mask](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover.html)

The [CDC now recommends](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover.html) cloth face coverings in public.

[Research suggests](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0843-2) surgical face masks could prevent transmission of human coronaviruses and influenza from symptomatic individuals. Perhaps [we should all be wearing them](https://medium.com/@Cancerwarrior/covid-19-why-we-should-all-wear-masks-there-is-new-scientific-rationale-280e08ceee71).

My family has a certain amount of [privilege](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/03/us/coronavirus-stay-home-rich-poor.html) and can shelter in place. We leave once a week for groceries. When we do leave, we wear masks to show solidarity with workers who need to be out in stores and markets. It is not about us. It is about the people who need to be out working.

Got a T-shirt? You can [make a mask at home](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yP_fnr4oVY&feature=youtu.be).

## 🤔 Consider

### When another person makes you suffer, it is because he suffers deeply within himself, and his suffering is spilling over. He does not need punishment; he needs help.

*Thich Nhat Hanh*

Thich Nhat Hanh's teaching on compassion connects to this issue's theme of care ethics. Whether it's Zoombombers disrupting classes or regions resisting social distancing, responding with punishment alone misses the deeper suffering. An ethics of care asks what help is needed, not just what rules were broken.
