TL;DR #176 - 12/1/2018

Hey all, welcome to TL;DR. Each week I synthesize the news of the week that I think you need to know in education, tech, & literacy.

This week I was at LRA 2018. It was an…interesting…conference this year. As I write this, I’m sitting in an airport in Phoenix as I slowly make my way back home. I’ll have more to think and write about later…but for now I’ll just share the slide decks from some of my talks.

* Digital storytelling in early childhood: Student illustrations & screen time shaping social interactions (https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bFtdlmlcSf7SBqWNMQaJ80zRPxjUWHy0zdL-yNJK2bQ/edit#slide=id.g313ae1fa18_0_416)

* Digitally Literate Educators Creating a Domain of One’s OwnThe Black Box & Educational Technologies (https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10u4TV8PDYKmQlswAH8tDB0yFM3zNiBzP2KfuiGl5LFQ/edit#slide=id.g35f391192_00)

* Research & reflection conducted in open, online spaces (https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ug49z6psc3096d3vEdCZ8dC9PhsTxJ_wM8zGnLD-9yY/edit#slide=id.p)

* The Internet changes everything!!! How naive were we? (https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mvh19D6PHIffPDztZr7IGZ0JIOVnrBZhh1-9O_BE8Ow/edit#slide=id.p)

More to come on all of these fronts.

Some insight on new advances in tech in higher ed.

## 📚 Read

------------------------------------------------------------

Kevin Hodgson (https://twitter.com/dogtrax) with another great post. Hodgson indicates how “broken” the Internet is…and posits that we might need to just start over to get it right. If so, here’s his wish list.

* Stronger filters for hate speech and trolls and bots and more

* More accountability for corporations setting up shop on the Web and its various connected places

* A reporting system that actually works, and not just via algorithms and keywords, either

* More tools in the hands of users to create on the Internet, like building smaller networks within the larger ones (the notion behind the Distributed Web)

* Stronger privacy controls and fewer Facebooks

* Less advertising through creepy data collection

* Better access for all (including rural users often left out)

** Do You Have a Moral Duty to Leave Facebook? (https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/24/opinion/sunday/facebook-immoral.html)

------------------------------------------------------------

enter image description here We’ve talked quite a bit in TL;DR about possibly leaving Facebook, and the reasons I have not…at this point.

Have you left Facebook?

Is it ultimately a moral issue whether or not you leave Facebook?

** The Values of Open Pedagogy (https://er.educause.edu/blogs/2018/11/the-values-of-open-pedagogy)

------------------------------------------------------------

Nancy Bunge on the role of open, digital pedagogy in our classrooms. To support open educational practices, we must understand the meaning of open pedagogy and articulate the values that shape it.

** Students Evaluating Teachers Doesn’t Just Hurt Teachers. It Hurts Students. (https://www.chronicle.com/article/Students-Evaluating-Teachers/245169)

------------------------------------------------------------

enter image description here

In a recent survey (https://www.chronicle.com/article/The-BestWorst-Part-of/244669) of 1,000 faculty members, commissioned by The Chronicle, almost two-thirds of the respondents said they thought students today were harder to teach than those in the past, and they overwhelmingly said that student engagement had gotten worse.

In recent professional development and conference presentations I’ve been hearing this refrain that students are disconnected, out of touch, and don’t focus. They think that “kids are totally different these days.” I’m not sure that is true.

** How Listening to Podcasts Helps Students Read and Learn (https://www.kqed.org/mindshift/49420/how-listening-to-podcasts-helps-students-read-and-learn)

------------------------------------------------------------

An audio interview (podcast) with Michael Godsey (https://twitter.com/themrgodsey) lesson plans (https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Store/Mike-And-Melissa-Godsey) for teaching with podcasts (https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Store/Mike-And-Melissa-Godsey) and started hearing from teachers around the country about how podcasts were getting students excited about learning again.

## 🔨 Do

------------------------------------------------------------

George Couros (https://twitter.com/gcouros) with a short post on technology can actually be used to build face-to-face relationships, not limit them.

As the world becomes more “digital,” it is crucial we become more “human.” This is imperative.

## 🤔 Consider

** Everything is a learning process: any time you fall over, it’s just teaching you to stand up the next time.
