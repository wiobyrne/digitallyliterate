### [Amanda Gorman - The Hill We Climb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wz4YuEvJ3y4)

On January 20, 2021, President Joe Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris were sworn into office. At the Inauguration ceremony, U.S. Youth Poet Laureate [Amanda Gorman](https://twitter.com/TheAmandaGorman) made history as the youngest Inaugural poet with her work, "The Hill We Climb."

The 22-year-old's powerful delivery demonstrated how creative expression can serve as commentary on democracy—a voice rising above the chaos of the previous weeks to articulate a vision of national unity and healing.

Here are [several ways](https://teachlivingpoets.com/2021/01/20/amanda-gorman-inauguration-poem-lessons/) you can bring this into your life. Use this to [talk with students about creative expression](https://www.tolerance.org/magazine/teach-this-the-hill-we-climb-and-the-2021-inauguration) as a commentary on democracy. Consider picking up Gorman's upcoming picture book, [Change Sings](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/634480/change-sings-by-amanda-gorman-illustrated-by-loren-long/).

### [RAND Releases Media Literacy Standards](https://www.rand.org/)

This week, the RAND Corporation released a new set of media literacy standards designed to support schools in combating misinformation.

The standards are part of RAND's ongoing project on "truth decay": a phenomenon that RAND researchers describe as "the diminishing role that facts, data, and analysis play in our political and civic discourse." In an era when conspiracy theories and partisan narratives compete equally with verified journalism in social feeds, these standards provide educators with a framework for teaching critical evaluation skills.

### [Banning Trump Won't Fix Social Media: 10 Ideas to Rebuild Our Broken Internet](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/jan/16/how-to-fix-social-media-trump-ban-free-speech)

Away from the vitriol, researchers are investigating concrete steps companies, officials, and the rest of us can take to tackle the crisis. Notable proposals include:

- [Joan Donovan](https://twitter.com/BostonJoan) - Hire 10,000 librarians for the Internet
- [Whitney Phillips](https://twitter.com/wphillips49) - Fund training for teachers, our "informational first responders"
- [malkia devich-cyril](https://twitter.com/culturejedi) - Understand the limitations of the first amendment

These proposals recognize that content moderation alone won't solve disinformation—we need sustained investment in media literacy infrastructure and the professionals who can help people navigate information ecosystems.

### [Increasingly Militant 'Parler Refugees' and Anxious QAnon Adherents Prep for Doomsday](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/increasingly-militant-parler-refugees-anxious-qanon-adherents-prep-doomsday-n1254775)

Conspiracy theorists enjoyed the Trump presidency. Wild false notions about high-profile deaths and what was really going on in Washington and Hollywood took over certain sections of the internet.

It all came to a head when insurrectionists, who believed the president's lie that [the election had been stolen](https://www.npr.org/2020/12/30/951095644/even-if-its-bonkers-poll-finds-many-believe-qanon-and-other-conspiracy-theories), stormed the Capitol building.

QAnon followers have become [more divorced from reality](https://www.npr.org/2020/12/30/951095644/even-if-its-bonkers-poll-finds-many-believe-qanon-and-other-conspiracy-theories) since the Capitol riots as some are targeted by extremists who try to radicalize them further. Extremism researchers are calling some accounts "Parler refugees"—users stumbling onto increasingly militant information streams on smaller, unmoderated messaging apps.

### [Fired Florida Data Scientist Rebekah Jones Turns Herself In](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/18/us/rebekah-jones-data-scientist-surrender/index.html)

[Rebekah Jones](https://twitter.com/georebekah), the former Florida data analyst who accused state officials of covering up the extent of the pandemic, turned herself in after a warrant was issued for her arrest.

Timeline of events:
- **May 2020**: Jones fired from Florida Department of Health. State officials cited "insubordination"; Jones claimed she refused to falsify Covid-19 data.
- **July 2020**: Jones filed a whistleblower complaint with the Florida Commission on Human Relations.
- **Post-firing**: Jones published her own Covid-19 dashboard, claiming to have received proof that state officials "were lying in January (2020) about internal reports and notices from the CDC."
- **December 7, 2020**: Jones' home was raided. She filed a lawsuit alleging FDLE officials violated her First Amendment rights.

This week Jones [turned herself in](https://twitter.com/GeoRebekah/status/1350524144434241536) to protect her family from continued police violence, stating: "The Governor will not win his war on science and free speech. He will not silence those who speak out."

### [Turn Off That Camera During Virtual Meetings, Environmental Study Says](https://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2021/Q1/turn-off-that-camera-during-virtual-meetings,-environmental-study-says.html)

Just one hour of videoconferencing or streaming emits 150-1,000 grams of carbon dioxide. Leaving your camera off during a web call can reduce these footprints by 96%.

A small adjustment with significant environmental impact—something to consider as remote work becomes permanent for many.

### [The Scientific Way to Cut Cake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBU9N35ZHIw)

The triangular slice is not the "scientific" way to cut a cake.

Alex Bellos recommends a different approach, which helps keep any leftovers fresher longer. He cites a [Letter to the Editor from Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/75173c0.pdf), a weekly science magazine, that dates back to December 1906.

Sometimes the most useful knowledge comes from the most unexpected places.

## 🤔 Consider

### I moved through the world never quite fitting in. But words—words were my way of finding my place.

*Amanda Gorman*

Gorman's reflection on finding voice through language connects to this issue's threads—using your voice to combat truth decay, whistleblowers speaking out against power, and the need for librarians and teachers as informational guides. Voice is power, and power can be used to heal or harm.
