** Too Long; Didn't Read (TL;DR) newsletter #27

------------------------------------------------------------

Hi all, welcome to a new year!!! Hopefully you had some time to relax, reflect, and celebrate what's important in your worlds.

In TL;DR I'm sharing things that happened during the week in literacy, technology, & education that I think you should know.

Please feel free to share with others you believe would benefit. If you like what you see here, I recommend subscribing (http://wiobyrne.us11.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=7b5ee323a16720dad25ff96ff&id=17e92a2ae1) to get it hand-delivered to your inbox.

Over the past two weeks I accomplished the following:

* Social Scholars: Educators' digital identity construction in open, online learning environments (http://wiobyrne.com/social-scholars/) - This piece examined participants in the #WalkMyWorld Project from two years ago and highlights challenges as educators create and curate an online brand.

* Computational Participation: Coding and programming as literacy activities (http://wiobyrne.com/computational-participation-coding-and-programming-as-literacy-activities/) - This JAAL column was published just this week. It examines possibilities to embed "computational thinking and participation" in the classroom as opposed to just a focus on coding/programming. We'll hold interviews over the coming weeks...so let me know if you want to be involved, or have someone I should chat with.

* A New Hope: Negotiating the integration of transmedia storytelling & literacy instruction (http://wiobyrne.com/transmedia-storytelling-literacy-instruction/) - This column was just submitted to JAAL this week. In it we're trying to tackle digital storytelling and transmedia narratives in the literacy classroom. Please feel free to leave comments on the Google Doc we share in the post. We'll fold in your comments as we go to press.

* Privacy, Identity, & Protecting Yourself (and your students) online (https://medium.com/advocat-ed/privacy-identity-protecting-yourself-and-your-students-online-1a4ed075fe25#.uai8kx9d6) - This piece was shared on the AdvocatED Medium pub (https://medium.com/advocat-ed) . In it I identify possibilities to educate, empower, and advocate for others in online spaces.

* Using Slack and Trello to organize a podcasting series about literacy education and research (http://wiobyrne.com/slack-trello-to-organize-podcasting-series/) - This post discusses the use of these two tools to organize and plan our Research to Practice podcast series.

The final piece I shared this week was titled Work with cool people on stuff that you love (http://wiobyrne.com/work-with-cool-people-on-stuff-that-you-love/) . This was really an open letter to some of my colleagues as we start the new year and new initiatives. It's also a call to inspire all of you and promote innovation.

This video comes from a Ted-Ed lesson available at the link above. I recommend subscribing to the ** Ted-Ed YouTube Channel (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA)

. I appreciate videos like this as supplemental content for students in hybrid learning spaces.

The video and teaching materials are suitable for a secondary classroom. The science and vocabulary in the clip may require some extra scaffolding for students.

## 📚 Read

** New York Public Library invites a deep digital dive (http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/06/books/new-york-public-library-invites-a-deep-digital-dive.html)

A post from the Books section of the NY Times sharing collections of digitized, open source content made available by the NY Public Library. Their new ** Public Domain Collection (http://www.nypl.org/research/collections/digital-collections/public-domain)

series just went live, and it offers an incredible collection of resources.

The challenge with projects like this is that they sometimes come off as "data dumps" and the average person is drowned by the vast amount of images, videos, and digital content. The link above to the NY Times post...and the new portal from the NYPL hope to help you make sense of it all.

** Pew Research Report on Parents, Teens, and Digital Monitoring (http://www.pewinternet.org/2016/01/07/parents-teens-and-digital-monitoring/)

A new report from the ** Pew research Center (http://www.pewresearch.org/)

. This research examines the beliefs and habits we've had about parents monitoring the social media habits of their children (age 13 - 17).

The takeaways solidify steps that we suspected/hoped parents were taking with their children in terms of online and social media. Parents are monitoring students use of online and social media. They're also (thankfully) not using tracking software to control/restrict/track their children.

The most interesting elements in my opinion were about parents discussing social norms and acceptable behaviors for online interactions with their children. I want to dig into those elements a bit more to see what and when they're sharing this guidance.

** "Writing on screens taking off in classroom contexts" (http://www.psfk.com/2016/01/writing-on-screens-classroom-technology-tablet-computing-sandymoor-school.html)

In my work I'm often asked about purchase/use of iPads/tablets and the need for keyboards. I usually advise educators to purchase Chromebooks as opposed to iPads for a variety of reasons. One of these reasons involves the questions I have about students and their ability to adequately or effectively work without a keyboard.

This post was "provided and funded by Microsoft" and hides a Surface ad in between statements about research and pedagogy.

I'm still trying to figure out the best options for students as they use computers in learning settings. I think the proper kit might include a Chromebook and a small tablet. A stylus might be helpful as well as a bluetooth mouse to help students navigate content. Having a package like this would enable learners to choose what works best for them and how they like to engage with digital content.

** A new pedagogy is emerging...and online learning is a key contributing factor (http://teachonline.ca/tools-trends/how-teach-online-student-success/new-pedagogy-emerging-and-online-learning-key-contributing-factor)

The overall report details seven trends in education and then provides further description and links out to give a better understanding of each.

The seven trends include:

* blended learning

* collaborative approaches to construction of knowledge/building communities of practice

* use of multimedia and open ed resources

* increased learner control, choice, and independence

* anywhere, anytime, and size learning

* new forms of assessment

* self-directed and non-formal online learning

** Why virtual classes (MOOCs) can be better than real ones (http://nautil.us/issue/29/scaling/why-virtual-classes-can-be-better-than-real-ones)

Fascinating essay in which Dr. Barbara Oakley, an engineering professor at Oakland University defends the use of online educational technologies. She collaborated to create a MOOC on the general art of learning. This course was identified as one of the ** most popular online courses available (http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/12/29/the-most-popular-online-course-teaches-you-to-learn/?_r=0)

. The course is available on Coursera and had 1,192,697 students enrolled the last time it was offered by the University of California.

In the essay she maintains that the rise in MOOCs is fueled by young professionals that are interested in self-directed, life-long learning. The post is a rallying cry for online learning experiences...and a motivating force for those of us trying to build and share them.

As you read this essay, I recommend checking out ** this piece (http://hechingerreport.org/data-mining-shows-that-recorded-video-lectures-are-the-least-effective-way-to-learn/)

about the role of video lectures in online courses.

** Pupil Size: A measure of trust? (http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/pupil-size-a-measure-of-trust/)

Intriguing piece of research and discussion about eye contact and "pupil size" and human interactions.

The research appeared in ** Psychological Science (http://pss.sagepub.com/content/early/2015/07/30/0956797615588306.abstract)

and it suggests that participants trusted partners with dilating pupils and withheld trust from participants that had constricting pupils. They also suggest an element of mimicry in terms of pupil dilation when we're meeting with people that we trust, or have a bond with.

I'm fascinated by the role of eye contact, and judgments made about eye contact as we pick up visual cues from others. I'm conscious of this as I teach and establish eye contact with students. I'm also conscious of this as I have one-to-one discussions with colleagues and students. I often find my eyes wandering around as I carry on discussions and try to make points.

## 🔨 Do

Video creation, editing, and production can be a powerful learning activity in our classrooms at any level. Part of the challenge is that educators often don't know the first place to start. Additionally, there is the question about what makes quality video content after you have completed the work.

This series from Wistia is for small business owners, but can easily be used as a resource for the classroom. I recommend saving this and linking out from your classroom website for later use.
