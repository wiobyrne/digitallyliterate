## üì≤ The Attention Economy

The "attention economy" reframes attention as a scarce resource in a world of abundant information. Economist [Herbert A. Simon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_A._Simon) described attention as the "bottleneck of human thought," limiting our ability to perceive and act. His assertion that "a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention" resonates today. [Explore](https://acroll.substack.com/p/what-comes-after-the-attention-economy).

In 1997, physicist [Michael Goldhaber](https://goldhaber.org/) predicted a shift from material-based economies to attention-based systems, emphasizing that attention‚Äînot information‚Äîis scarce. Businesses have since adapted to exploit this scarcity, transforming how we consume content. [Investigate further](https://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/519/440).

## ü™ü Deskilling

The process of *deskilling* simplifies complex work into repetitive tasks, centralizing knowledge among a select few while workers lose context. [Understand deskilling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deskilling).

[danah boyd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danah_boyd) critiques AI's role in deskilling, cautioning about the balance between efficiency and skill preservation. [Read more](https://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2023-04-21/deskilling-on-the-job.html).

In response, [Laura Hilliger](https://www.laurahilliger.com/) argues that societal skills are evolving, with AI enhancing human capabilities rather than replacing them. [Dive into the discussion](https://www.laurahilliger.com/techie/deskilling-and-ai-as-a-tool/).

## Algorithmic Management

*Algorithmic management* uses technology to oversee and direct workers, particularly in platform economies like Uber. While these systems promise efficiency, they often reduce job variety, autonomy, and satisfaction. [Learn more](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2702123.2702548).

Research highlights the negative effects of these systems, including unpredictability and a lack of worker agency, exacerbated by opaque algorithms. [Go deeper](https://theconversation.com/3-ways-algorithmic-management-makes-work-more-stressful-and-less-satisfying-166030).
