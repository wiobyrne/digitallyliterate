# Learning in Public

## **Definition**  
Learning in public is the practice of sharing your learning journey, progress, and knowledge openly with others, often through social media, blogs, or public platforms.

## **Explain Like I'm 5**  
Learning in public is like showing your friends how you build a LEGO set and explaining each step as you go along. You're not just learning by yourself; you're teaching others too!

## **Digging Deeper**
Learning in public involves transparently documenting your learning process, challenges faced, resources used, and insights gained.
