# Podcast Index

## üéôÔ∏è Podcast Index

Welcome to my curated podcast journal. This space collects my personal notes, reflections, and resources related to podcasts I regularly listen to or find insightful. Some entries offer in-depth summaries and takeaways; others are placeholders for shows I‚Äôm exploring or plan to revisit.

You‚Äôll find podcast titles, topic subpages, and tagged notes below. If I've written about specific episodes, guests, or hosts, those links will appear as well. Use the search feature or site map for deeper exploration.

Whether you're a curious listener, an educator, or simply looking for new shows to check out, I hope this index helps you discover something valuable.

## üìÑ Consumed Episodes

Below is a list of podcast episodes I've listened to and annotated. I use these notes to capture interesting ideas, memorable quotes, and connections to my own work or teaching. Some entries include full transcripts, timestamped notes, or reflective summaries.

üõ†Ô∏è _I mark up podcast episodes much like I annotate books‚Äîhighlighting patterns, insights, and questions. These notes help me remember what resonated and sometimes become the seeds of future blog posts, research, or classroom discussions._
