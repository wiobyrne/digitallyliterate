# AI Index

Welcome! This is a living, evolving glossary of key terms and concepts in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), designed to support accessible learning and deeper exploration.

Each entry includes:

- A clear, beginner-friendly definition
    
- An “Explain Like I’m Five” (ELI5) explanation
    
- Links for further learning and context (when available)
    

> **🔹** = Essential / beginner-friendly  
> **🔸** = Advanced / nice-to-know

### 📚 How this Index is Organized

Rather than listing terms alphabetically, this glossary is organized **by conceptual flow** to support progressive learning. Terms are grouped into sections like _Core Concepts_, _Training & Optimization_, and _Ethics & Challenges_, and arranged to build understanding step-by-step from foundational ideas to more advanced or emerging topics.

You’re encouraged to explore based on your needs, interests, or learning goals.
