# AI illiteracy

## **Definition**  
AI illiteracy refers to a lack of understanding or knowledge about artificial intelligence (AI) and its capabilities.

## **Explain Like I'm 5**  
Imagine AI is like a robot that can do smart things like answer questions or play games. AI illiteracy is when people don't know how these robots work or what they can do.

## **Digging Deeper**
AI illiteracy can manifest in various ways, from not knowing the basics of AI technology to being unable to discern between real and fake information generated by AI algorithms. This lack of understanding can lead to misconceptions about AI's capabilities and limitations. For example, someone who is AI illiterate might believe that AI can predict the future with certainty, when in reality, it relies on data from the past to make predictions.

## **Applications**  
- Misinterpreting information generated by AI as completely accurate without considering potential biases or errors.
- Believing that AI systems are infallible and always make the best decisions without human oversight.
- Being unaware of how personal data is collected, used, and shared by AI systems.
- Falling for misinformation spread by malicious actors who exploit gaps in AI literacy.
- Overestimating the capabilities of consumer AI products like smart speakers or virtual assistants.
