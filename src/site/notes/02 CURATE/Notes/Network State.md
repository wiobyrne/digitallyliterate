# Network State

## **Definition**

A Network State is a social network with a clear collective purpose that eventually develops the capacity for political autonomy, diplomatic recognition, and potentially territorial sovereignty. It begins in the cloud as a community aligned around a shared vision before materializing into the physical world.

A network state is a digitally-first community that shares a strong sense of national consciousness, has a recognized founder, and is capable of collective action. It aims to eventually crowdfund and connect physical territories, build an integrated cryptocurrency and consensual governance, and ultimately achieve diplomatic recognition from existing states.

## **Explain Like I'm 5**

Imagine if all your friends from different places who love the same game decided to create their own special club with rules everyone agrees on. At first, you'd meet online, but eventually, you might find a real place where club members could live together and make your own little country.

## **Visualization**

_A visualization would show the evolution from digital community to physical settlement, depicting: 1) Online community formation, 2) Development of shared governance systems, 3) Acquisition of territory, 4) Recognition as a sovereign entity._

## **Digging Deeper**

The Network State concept was popularized by [[Balaji Srinivasan\|Balaji Srinivasan]] in his book "The Network State: How To Start a New Country." It represents a new approach to state formation that inverts traditional models by starting digitally rather than territorially.

Network States begin as online communities united by shared values, culture, and purpose. They develop internal governance systems, economic structures, and social coordination mechanisms while existing primarily in the digital realm. As they grow, they may establish physical presence through community hubs, property acquisition, or even dedicated territories.

What distinguishes a Network State from other digital communities is its aspiration to achieve some form of sovereignty and recognition in the international system. This could range from special economic zone status to full diplomatic recognition. The concept leverages blockchain technology, cryptocurrency, and decentralized governance to enable new forms of coordination and sovereignty outside traditional nation-state frameworks.

Unlike traditional micronations or separatist movements, Network States embrace technological solutions to governance challenges and maintain distributed rather than contiguous territories. They may negotiate with existing nation-states for recognition or special status rather than pursuing independence through conflict.

## **Applications**

- **Governance Experimentation**: Network States provide testbeds for novel governance models, voting systems, and decision-making processes that could address limitations in current democratic systems.
- **Economic Innovation**: They can implement alternative economic systems, such as cryptocurrency-based universal basic income, new property rights frameworks, or innovative tax structures.
- **Climate Action Coordination**: Communities could form Network States around environmental goals, pooling resources to purchase and rewild land or develop sustainable living communities across multiple locations.
- **Special Interest Sovereignty**: Groups with specific cultural, religious, or ideological values could create Network States to preserve and practice their way of life while maintaining global connections.
- **Digital Nomad Infrastructure**: Network States could develop consistent legal frameworks and physical infrastructure to support globally mobile knowledge workers across multiple jurisdictions.
