# Deep Learning

## **Definition**  
Deep Learning is a subfield of machine learning that mimics the human brain in processing data for use in decision making. It uses artificial neural networks with many layers (hence the 'deep') to learn and make intelligent decisions.

## **Explain Like I'm 5**  
Imagine you're trying to recognize animals. First, you notice simple things like color and size, then more complex features like fur or feathers, and finally, you can identify the animal. Deep learning works in a similar way - it starts by learning simple features and then combines them to understand more complex concepts.

## **Digging Deeper**
Deep learning, also known as deep structured learning or hierarchical learning, is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on artificial neural networks with representation learning. "Deep" refers to the number of layers through which the data is transformed in these networks. More layers allow for more complex features to be learned from the data. For example, in image recognition, lower layers may identify edges, while higher layers may identify the concepts relevant to a human such as digits or letters or faces.

Each layer of neurons needs input data to learn from. They get this input from a previous layer’s output—this is what makes it a deep network: the input layer receives raw pixel data and each subsequent layer receives feature information from the preceding layer(s).

## **Applications**  
- **Image Recognition**: Deep Learning has been widely used in identifying objects within images.
- **Speech Recognition**: Speech interfaces like Google Assistant and Alexa are powered by Deep Learning algorithms.
- **Medical Diagnosis**: Deep Learning systems are used to detect diseases such as cancer just by looking at medical images.
- **Financial Fraud Detection**: Deep Learning is used to detect fraudulent transactions by recognizing patterns and anomalies.
- **Autonomous Driving**: Deep learning algorithms are used in self-driving cars for object detection, navigation, and path planning.
