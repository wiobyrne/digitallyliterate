# Blanket bans don’t work 

**ELI5 Explanation**: Blanket bans don’t work because they’re like trying to stop a rainstorm with an umbrella stop the rain, it just makes things harder. Students are going to use technology no matter what. Instead of saying “no,” teachers can say “let’s learn how to use it the right way.” That helps kids use AI to think of big ideas, solve problems, and work well with others. It’s about teaching them to use tools wisely, not hiding the tools altogether.

**Introduction**: We live in a tech-saturated world where young people are constantly connected and have access to a plethora of information at their fingertips. In this setting, it is not uncommon for schools and educators to implement blanket bans on certain technologies or platforms in an attempt to maintain focus and control in the classroom. However, these bans are often ineffective and can even be counterproductive. 

**Why blanket bans don't work**: Blanket bans, by their very nature, are an attempt to completely eliminate something from a particular environment or context. This can be likened to trying to stop a rainstorm with an umbrella; it's not going to prevent the rain, but rather make things more difficult. When it comes to technology in schools, students are going to use it no matter what restrictions are imposed.

**The alternative approach**: Instead of outright banning technology, teachers could adopt a more constructive approach by saying "let's learn how to use it the right way." This encourages students to leverage technology responsibly and effectively. It is about teaching them how to use these tools wisely rather than hiding them altogether.

**The benefits of teaching responsible tech use**: By guiding students on how to responsibly utilize technology, we can empower them to think of big ideas, solve problems, collaborate effectively with others and develop crucial 21st-century skills.

**Conclusion**: While blanket bans might seem like an easy solution at first glance, they often fall short of achieving their intended goals. Instead of resorting to such measures, our focus should shift towards educating young minds on responsible tech usage that prepares them for the digital world we live in today.
