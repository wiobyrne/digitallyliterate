# The IKEA Effect

## **Definition**  
The IKEA Effect is a cognitive bias where people place a higher value on products they have partially created or assembled themselves, such as IKEA furniture.

## **Explain Like I'm 5**  
Imagine you're making a special craft project. Even if it's not perfect, you might love it more because you worked hard on it. That's the IKEA Effect!

## **Digging Deeper**
The IKEA Effect stems from the idea that people tend to overvalue things they have put effort into creating. When individuals invest time and effort in assembling or building something, such as furniture from IKEA, they develop a sense of ownership and attachment to the final product, leading them to perceive it as more valuable than if it were pre-made.

For example, when someone spends hours putting together a piece of furniture, they may overlook its flaws or imperfections because of the emotional connection they've formed during the assembly process. This bias can influence consumer behavior and purchasing decisions in various contexts beyond just furniture.

## **Applications**  
- DIY projects: People tend to value homemade crafts or creations more than store-bought items due to the effort put into making them.
- Personalized gifts: Handmade gifts are often cherished more by recipients because of the time and care put into creating them.
- Cooking from scratch: Individuals may enjoy home-cooked meals more than restaurant dishes because of the satisfaction of preparing food themselves.
- Customized products: Companies can leverage the IKEA Effect by involving customers in the design process, leading to greater attachment and loyalty to the final product.
- Team projects: Collaborative efforts where team members contribute equally can result in stronger bonds and appreciation for the outcome.
