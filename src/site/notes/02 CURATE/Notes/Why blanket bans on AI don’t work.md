# Why blanket bans on AI don’t work

- Bans don’t stop students from using AI; they just push usage underground or create fear instead of understanding.
- They miss the opportunity to teach critical skills like creativity, critical thinking, and ethical collaboration.
- Focusing on _how_ students use AI, rather than banning it, helps prepare them for a tech-driven future.
- AI can be a tool for growth if guided properly, not something to fear or block outright.
