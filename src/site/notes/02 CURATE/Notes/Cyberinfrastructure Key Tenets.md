# Cyberinfrastructure Key Tenets 

Based on the principles of minimal computing in Digital Humanities and the broader concepts of cyberinfrastructure and open source, here are some key mindsets, non-negotiables, and questions to consider as you build your own cloud and digital infrastructure:

  Mindsets: 
1. Sustainability-focused: Prioritize long-term viability over short-term gains.
2. Resource-conscious: Be mindful of hardware, software, and energy constraints.
3. Accessibility-driven: Ensure your work is accessible to a wide range of users and contexts.
4. Open and transparent: Embrace open-source solutions and share your process.
5. Security-aware: Prioritize cybersecurity in all aspects of your infrastructure.

  Non-negotiables: 
1. Use of open standards and protocols
2. Regular security updates and patches
3. Data backup and recovery plans
4. Documentation of all processes and decisions
5. Respect for user privacy and data protection

Key Questions:
1. What do we need? (Identify essential components)
2. What do we have? (Assess available resources)
3. What must we prioritize? (Determine critical features)
4. What are we willing to give up? (Identify acceptable trade-offs)
5. How can we ensure long-term sustainability?
6. How can we make our infrastructure more accessible?
7. What are the security implications of our choices?
8. How can we minimize environmental impact?
9. How can we contribute back to the open-source community?
10. How will our choices affect collaboration and interoperability?

By keeping these mindsets, non-negotiables, and questions at the forefront as you build your infrastructure, you'll be better equipped to create a sustainable, secure, and accessible system that aligns with the principles of minimal computing and open science.
