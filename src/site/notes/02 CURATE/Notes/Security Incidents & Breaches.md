# Security Incidents & Breaches

## Summary
Security incidents and breaches refer to instances where unauthorized individuals gain access to an organization's data, applications, systems, or networks. These incidents often lead to loss of confidential information, disruption of business operations, and may result in significant financial and reputational damage.

## Core Content
Security incidents can range from minor events like an employee accidentally accessing sensitive data, to significant breaches involving hackers stealing millions of customer records. These include malware attacks, phishing scams, denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and ransomware threats among others.

A security incident is an occurrence that **actually** or **potentially jeopardizes** the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an information system or the information the system processes, stores, or transmits or that constitutes a violation or imminent threat of violation of security policies, security procedures, or acceptable use policies.  A security incident may have significant impact on the organization, damage or destroy data and systems, and cause outages. However, a security incident doesn't automatically result in a data breach. 

A data breach is a legally defined term, but it is generally an intentional, unauthorized access to sensitive or confidential data. It may arise due to the hack of a data system. Malware can be the culprit and cause a backdoor security hole or leak on a server. Sometimes a stolen or lost device (or storage device) with unencrypted HD can result in a breach. These are all examples of unauthorized access.  

Security breaches represent the most costly data incidents to manage. One of the most common causes of a data breach?  Human error.

The repercussions of security breaches are far-reaching. They not only involve the immediate loss of data but also result in a loss of customer trust that may take years to rebuild. The financial implications can be immense due to the costs associated with incident response, legal fees and regulatory fines.

To mitigate these risks, organizations must implement strong cybersecurity measures. This includes establishing robust security policies and procedures, using advanced threat detection solutions and regularly training employees on security best practices.

## Reflection
Understanding the concept of security incidents and breaches is crucial in today's digital age where data has become a valuable asset. This knowledge helps me evaluate the cybersecurity measures taken by different companies while investing in their stocks or using their services.
