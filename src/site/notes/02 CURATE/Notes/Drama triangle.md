# Drama triangle

## ELI5

The "drama triangle" is like a game that some people play without realizing it. Imagine it's a triangle and each corner is a role that people can take: the Victim, the Rescuer, and the Persecutor. 

The Victim is someone who always feels like bad things happen to them. They feel helpless and often need someone else to fix their problems.

The Rescuer is the person who jumps in to help the Victim. They feel good helping others, but sometimes forget to take care of themselves.

The Persecutor is someone who blames others for their problems or might even bully them. They make others feel bad to avoid dealing with their own issues.

These roles aren't fixed; people can switch from one role to another in this game. But like many games, this one doesn't always make people happy. It's better if we learn how not to play this game and instead solve our problems in healthier ways.

## Quick Note
The drama triangle is a psychological and social model of human interaction put forth by Stephen Karpman in his 1968 article "Fairy Tales and Script Drama Analysis". The model includes three roles: the persecutor, the victim, and the rescuer. These roles can be fluid and individuals may switch between them in different situations or even within a single interaction. Understanding this dynamic can help in recognizing and breaking unhealthy patterns of behavior.
