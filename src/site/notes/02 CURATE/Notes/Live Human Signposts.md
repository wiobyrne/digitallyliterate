# Live Human Signposts

The concept of a “live human signpost” refers to individuals who serve as guides or beacons of hope in challenging situations. This term was popularized by [[Vincent Harding\|Vincent Harding]], a civil rights activist and educator. Harding used the metaphor to describe people who provide direction and light for others in dark circumstances, helping them see possibilities they might not otherwise recognize. These signposts are not just abstract ideas but real, living individuals who share their journeys and offer support to others.

For example, Vincent Harding himself was a live human signpost, offering guidance and wisdom to young people in difficult situations. He emphasized the importance of these signposts in communities, suggesting that they help illuminate paths for those who might otherwise feel lost or hopeless.

The idea of live human signposts has been applied in various contexts, such as educational programs and community support initiatives. For instance, the Ecoversities Alliance has a project called “Live Human Signposts” that showcases individuals who have taken alternative paths and are sharing their experiences to inspire and guide others.

In summary, a live human signpost is someone who, through their actions and presence, helps others navigate through challenging times and discover new possibilities.
