# Data Protection in Education Sector

In the education sector, various institutions, policies, and tools are actively in place for protecting students' data. These entities ensure the privacy of personal information and academic records from unauthorized access, manipulation, and breaches.

1. Educational Institutions: Schools and universities play a critical role in protecting students' data. They implement different security measures like firewalls, encryption tools, and strict access protocols. 

2. Legislation: Laws like the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) in the U.S., General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in EU countries provide legal frameworks for protecting students' data.

3. EdTech Companies: Companies providing digital platforms for learning also contribute to data protection by ensuring their software meets strict security standards.

4. Third-party Security Providers: Institutions often enlist third-party services to manage cybersecurity threats and provide additional layers of protection.

5. Students & Parents: Individuals themselves can also take measures to ensure their data is protected by being aware of what they share online and understanding their rights under various data protection laws.

**So, What is Data Security All About?**

A teacher would never let a stranger off of the street come into the classroom and interact with their students, so we must be sure we do not allow it online either. Protecting student's data means that we must protect the student's digital self. school systems should prioritize the protection of data at the same level of the physical security.

When we talk about data security, we’re referring to the physical, technical and administrative protective measures that are applied to the data, the equipment, software and the network it all sits on. Data security protects the data from unauthorized access and also maintains the integrity of the data, protects it from being corrupted or unintentionally destroyed. It is traditionally a technical discipline. 

Who is responsible for protecting our school system's data?
