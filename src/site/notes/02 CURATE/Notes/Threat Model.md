# Threat Model

## **Definition**  
A threat model is a personalized assessment of potential risks to privacy and security based on individual circumstances and vulnerabilities.

## **Explain Like I'm 5**  
Think of a threat model as creating a shield that protects you from invisible bad people who want to take your secrets. By understanding where the bad guys might come from, you can build a strong shield to keep your secrets safe.

## **Digging Deeper**
Threat modeling involves identifying assets (like personal data), potential threats (such as hackers or malware), vulnerabilities (weak points in your security), and impacts (what could happen if a threat succeeds). By understanding these elements, individuals can prioritize security measures to protect themselves effectively.

A threat model is a personalized assessment of the potential risks to your privacy and security based on your specific situation, vulnerabilities, and the value of your information to potential adversaries. It helps prioritize which protective measures are most important for your circumstances.

For beginners, a threat model can be understood as:
- A personalized risk assessment for your digital life
- A way to identify what needs the most protection and from whom
- A method for making informed decisions about privacy and security tools
- A framework that helps avoid both under-protection and over-protection

## **Applications**  
- Personal cybersecurity: Assessing risks to personal data and online accounts
- Business security: Identifying threats to company information and systems
- Privacy protection: Evaluating risks to sensitive information shared online
- IoT devices: Analyzing potential threats to connected devices like smart home appliances
- Threat intelligence: Using threat models to anticipate cyber threats and mitigate risks proactively
