Professionalism is a set of behaviors and attitudes that one exhibits in a workplace or professional setting. It is a characteristic that allows individuals to conduct themselves with respect, responsibility, integrity, accountability, and excellence. It also involves continuous learning, competence in one's field, and adherence to ethical standards.

1. **Honesty/Candor**: Professionalism demands honesty and transparency in all professional dealings. This involves being truthful about your skills, qualifications, ideas, and mistakes. Candor refers to the quality of being open, sincere, and straightforward in communication.

2. **Empathy**: In a professional context, empathy refers to the ability to understand and share the feelings of others. This is crucial for effective team-work and leadership as it helps build trust and mutual understanding. It involves respecting others' perspectives even if they differ from yours.

3. **Know Thyself**: Self-awareness is an essential part of professionalism. Knowing your strengths and weaknesses allows you to maximize your potential while working on areas that need improvement. It also aids in maintaining emotional balance at work.

To summarize, professionalism encapsulates qualities such as honesty/candor, empathy and self-awareness which are important for not just individual growth but also for fostering healthy work environments.
