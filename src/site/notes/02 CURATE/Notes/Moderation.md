# Moderation

## **Definition**  
Moderation refers to the process of ensuring balance, fairness, and restraint in various aspects of life, such as behavior, consumption, or decision-making.

## **Explain Like I'm 5**  
Think of moderation like eating your favorite treats. You can have some cookies or candy, but not too much or it might make you sick. Moderation helps you enjoy things without going overboard.

Moderation is about finding a middle ground between excess and deficiency. It involves self-control and making choices that are reasonable and sustainable. For example, in dieting, moderation means enjoying occasional treats while mostly eating healthy foods to maintain a balanced diet.

## **Applications**
