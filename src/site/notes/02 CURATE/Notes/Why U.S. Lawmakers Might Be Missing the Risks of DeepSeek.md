# Why U.S. Lawmakers Might Be Missing the Risks of DeepSeek

**It's Not as Visible as TikTok**
TikTok was like a big, noisy party that everyone could see. DeepSeek is more like a quiet chess game happening in the background. It's harder for lawmakers to notice.

**AI is Complicated**
Imagine trying to explain how a smartphone works to someone who's never seen one. That's how complex AI can be. Many lawmakers might not fully grasp the technology, making it hard to spot potential problems.

**They're Looking at the Wrong Things**
Lawmakers are often focused on immediate issues, like "Is this app stealing our data right now?" But DeepSeek's risks are more about the future - like who will control AI technology in the long run.

**It's a Slow-Moving Problem**
The risks with DeepSeek might not show up for years. It's like climate change - hard to see day-to-day, but potentially huge in the long term.

**It Looks Good on the Surface**
Free AI sounds great, right? But it's the hidden costs that matter. It's like getting a "free" puppy - you don't realize how expensive it might be to care for it in the long run.

**It's a New Kind of Challenge**
Lawmakers are used to dealing with things like data privacy. But DeepSeek presents a new kind of challenge - it's about who controls the future of technology. This is unfamiliar territory for many of them.

In simple terms, DeepSeek's risks are less obvious and more long-term than something like TikTok. It's a bit like trying to spot a small leak in a big dam - it might not seem dangerous now, but over time, it could lead to big problems. Lawmakers might be missing this because they're not used to looking for these kinds of slow-developing, tech-based risks.

## Simplify


U.S. lawmakers may be overlooking the risks of DeepSeek due to its less conspicuous nature compared to apps like TikTok, and the complexity of AI technology. Their focus on immediate issues and unfamiliarity with the long-term implications and control over future technology might also contribute to this oversight. Essentially, the potential problems with DeepSeek are more subtle and future-oriented, making them harder for lawmakers used to dealing with immediate, visible issues to detect.
