# Self-Efficacy and Self-Confidence

Research suggests that self-efficacy and self-confidence are important factors in learning and expertise development (Schunk & Usher, 2011). They are important factors in the development of expertise and learning, as they influence an individual's motivation, effort, persistence, and mindset.

Self-efficacy refers to an individual's belief in their ability to successfully perform a specific task or achieve a particular goal (Artino, 2012). It is a person's perception of their own competence and confidence in their abilities (Pajares & Johnson, 1994). Self-efficacy can influence motivation, behavior, and achievement, and is often considered a key factor in determining success in various domains of life (Pajares & Schunk, 2001).

There are subtle differences between confidence and self-confidence. Confidence is directed towards something outside oneself, and it is based on evidence or experience of its reliability or quality.  Self-confidence is directed towards oneself, and it is based on one’s belief in their own competence or potential. It is a measure of their self-assurance and assurance in their own abilities to learn and perform cognitive tasks (O'Brien & Pere, 1985). Confidence in learning and cognition can impact motivation, persistence, and performance, and is often considered a key factor in determining success in academic and professional settings (Schunk, 2003). Please note, the distinction between confidence and self-confidence is unclear and complex, since confidence depends on external and specific evidence, while self-confidence relies on internal and general belief (Kind, 2009). In this research, we will focus on self-confidence in learning and cognition as an individual's belief in their ability to successfully understand and apply new information or skills (Stajkovic & Luthans, 1998). But, the reader should understand that there are numerous internal and external cognitive and social factors that influence an individuals beliefs in their ability to complete a task, achieve a goal, or succeed (Mills, 2014)

There are similarities between self-confidence and self-efficacy, but also key differences in learning and cognition. Self-confidence is a general personality trait that refers to the strength of belief in oneself, but it is non-specific as to what the certainty is about (Kleitman & Stankov, 2007). For example, a learner might have high self-confidence in general, but low self-confidence in a particular domain, such as math or public speaking. Self-efficacy, on the other hand, is a situation- or task-specific belief in one's ability to complete a task or achieve a goal (Artino, 2012). It is influenced by factors such as past performance, feedback, modeling, and emotional state (Lugo, Hjelmeland, Hansen, Haug, Sütterlin & Grønlien, 2021). For example, a learner might have high self-efficacy in math if they have done well on math tests before, received positive feedback from a teacher, observed others solving math problems successfully, and felt calm and confident while doing math. Self-efficacy is more focused and dynamic than self-confidence, and it can vary depending on the context and the challenge (Hendricks, 2014). Self-efficacy can also affect self-confidence, as having high self-efficacy in a domain can boost an individuals overall self-confidence, and vice versa (Cramer, Neal, & Brodsky, 2009).

Research has shown that self-efficacy and confidence are important factors in the development of expertise and learning. Pollack & Lilly (2008) found that experiential assignments can instill self-efficacy and competence in marketing students, but that a combination of self-directed and instructor-directed learning elements are critical. Self-efficacy beliefs influence an individual's motivation, effort, and persistence in learning and performing tasks. Pajares (1993) found that confidence in one's writing abilities is positively correlated with subsequent writing performance. Moores & Chang (2009) found that self-efficacy is positively related to performance, but overconfidence can lead to a significant negative relationship between self-efficacy and subsequent performance. When individuals have high self-efficacy beliefs, they are more likely to set challenging goals, exert effort, and persist in the face of difficulties. In contrast, individuals with low self-efficacy beliefs are more likely to avoid challenging tasks, give up easily, and experience anxiety and stress.

Similarly, confidence in learning and cognition is crucial for success in academic and professional settings. Confidence allows individuals to approach new challenges with a positive attitude and a belief in their ability to learn and perform well. Currie (2008) found that confidence is a motivational driver and a consequence of learning and gaining respect, and is necessary for moving on to impact in practice development. This positive mindset can lead to increased motivation, engagement, and achievement. On the other hand, a lack of confidence can lead to negative self-talk, self-doubt, and a fear of failure, which can hinder learning and performance.

Self-efficacy and confidence are important for learning and expertise development, but that overconfidence can have negative effects on performance.
