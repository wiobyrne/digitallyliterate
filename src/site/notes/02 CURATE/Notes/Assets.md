# Assets

## **Definition**  
An asset is something of value that needs to be protected. In the context of digital security, assets can be information like emails, contact lists, files, or even devices themselves.

## **Explain Like I'm 5**  
Think of your assets like your favorite toys that you want to keep safe from getting lost or broken. Your important information and things you care about are like your toys that you need to protect.

## **Digging Deeper**
Assets are anything valuable to an individual or organization that needs protection. In digital security, assets can include personal information, financial data, intellectual property, or physical devices like computers and smartphones. By categorizing assets based on their sensitivity level (high, medium, low), individuals and organizations can prioritize their protection strategies.

An asset is something you value and want to protect. "In the context of digital security, an asset is usually some kind of information. For example, your emails, contact lists, instant messages, location, and files are all possible assets. Your devices themselves may also be assets," explains Privacy Guides[1](https://www.privacyguides.org/en/basics/threat-modeling/).

Consider categorizing your assets by sensitivity:

- High sensitivity (financial information, medical records)
    
- Medium sensitivity (personal photos, work documents)
    
- Low sensitivity (public social media posts)

## **Applications**  
- Personal Data Protection: Safeguarding sensitive personal information such as financial records and medical data.
- Business Security: Protecting intellectual property, customer data, and confidential business documents.
- Device Security: Securing smartphones, laptops, tablets, and other electronic devices from unauthorized access.
- Cloud Storage Security: Ensuring the safety of files stored in cloud services by implementing encryption and access controls.
