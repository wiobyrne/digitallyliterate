# Generative AI Reflection Questions 

Some reflective questions that can encourage students to think critically about their use of generative AI tools while ensuring they maintain ownership of their work:

### Self-Reflection on Use

1. **Frequency and Purpose**:
    
    - How often do you use generative AI tools in your classwork or assignments?
    - What types of tasks do you typically use them for (e.g., brainstorming, drafting, editing)?
    - How do these tools fit into your overall learning process?
2. **Ownership and Contribution**:
    
    - In what ways do you ensure that your voice and ideas remain central in the work you submit?
    - How do you balance your own input with the suggestions or outputs provided by AI?
    - Can you identify specific parts of your work where the tool had a significant influence and where your own voice was prominent?

### Reflection on Quality and Ethics

3. **Evaluation of Outputs**:
    
    - How do you feel about the quality of the material you generate with these tools?
    - What steps do you take to verify the accuracy and relevance of the AI-generated content?
    - Do you feel the tool helps improve your understanding of the subject, or does it sometimes hinder deeper learning?
4. **Creative and Critical Thinking**:
    
    - How do these tools impact your creative and critical thinking processes?
    - Are there times when you decide not to use generative AI tools? Why?
5. **Ethical Considerations**:
    
    - How do you approach giving credit to AI tools when they contribute to your work?
    - What do you think are the ethical implications of using AI in your learning and creation process?

### Growth and Improvement

6. **Feedback and Iteration**:
    
    - How do you use AI tools to reflect on and revise your work?
    - What have you learned about your own writing, thinking, or problem-solving by comparing your initial ideas to AI-generated suggestions?
7. **Personal Growth**:
    
    - Has your use of generative AI changed the way you think about learning or completing assignments? If so, how?
    - What would you like to improve about how you use these tools in the future?


are there open response questions we could ask about sustainability, the environment, etc?

what other areas might students have concerns about?

Open Response Questions:

**14. In your opinion, how can the use of generative AI tools contribute to environmental sustainability?**

**15. What potential concerns do you have about the impact of AI technologies on the environment or society at large?**

**16. How do you feel about the energy consumption associated with running AI models? Does this factor into your decision to use or not use these technologies?**

**17. Do you believe that AI tools could play a significant role in addressing environmental issues or societal challenges? If so, how?**

Other Areas of Concern:

- Data privacy and security: Students might have concerns about how their data is being stored and used by AI tools.
- Dependence on technology: There could be worries about becoming overly reliant on AI tools for learning and productivity.
- Job displacement: Students might be concerned about the potential for AI to replace human jobs in various fields.
- Fairness and bias: Concerns may exist regarding the potential for inherent biases in AI algorithms and their outputs.
- Accessibility: There could be concerns about whether all students have equal access to these advanced technological resources.
