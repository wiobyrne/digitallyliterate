# Autonomous Systems

Systems capable of operating independently of human control, often using AI to
make decisions in real-time based on environmental data.

## **Definition**  
Autonomous systems are systems that can operate independently of human control, often using artificial intelligence to make decisions in real-time based on environmental data.

## **Explain Like I'm 5**  
Imagine a robot that can move around your house and clean up without you telling it what to do. It knows where to go and what to do by itself, like a smart helper that doesn't need constant instructions.

## **Visualization**

## **Digging Deeper**
Autonomous systems rely on sensors, algorithms, and decision-making capabilities to perform tasks without human intervention. They can be found in self-driving cars, drones, robotic vacuum cleaners, and more. These systems use input from their surroundings to navigate and react in real-time.

## **Applications**  
- Self-driving cars: Autonomous vehicles use sensors and AI to navigate roads safely without human input.
- Drone delivery: Drones equipped with autonomous systems can deliver packages to remote locations efficiently.
- Industrial robots: Robots in manufacturing plants can operate autonomously to assemble products on production lines.
- Agricultural automation: Autonomous tractors and drones help farmers monitor crops and apply pesticides more effectively.
- Smart home devices: Devices like smart thermostats or virtual assistants use autonomous systems to learn user preferences and adjust settings accordingly.
