# Algorithm

## **Definition**  
An algorithm is a set of step-by-step instructions designed to perform a particular task or solve a specific problem.

## **Explain Like I'm 5**  
Think of an algorithm like a cooking recipe. It tells you what ingredients you need and the steps you have to follow in order to make a dish.

## **Visualization**

Keep in mind, after completion, you need to go back and analyze whether the goal was accomplished and if you need to revise, iterate or [[debug\|debug]] the algorithm and start again.

## **Digging Deeper**
In computing and mathematics, an algorithm is like a recipe that precisely defines a sequence of operations. These can range from simple procedures like sorting numbers in ascending order to complex operations such as training a machine learning model or decrypting encrypted data. Algorithms are usually created as functions within programming languages, providing the means for computers to solve problems and manipulate data. They are fundamental for many areas of computer science, including data analysis, artificial intelligence, graphics, network design, and cryptography.

## **Applications**  
- **Search Engines**: Google’s search engine uses an algorithm called PageRank to rank web pages in their search engine results.
- **Social Media**: Algorithms are used by Facebook and Instagram to decide which posts appear in your news feed.
- **Online Shopping**: Amazon uses algorithms for its recommendation system which suggests products based on your browsing and purchasing history.
- **Navigation Apps**: Google Maps uses algorithms to find the fastest route from one location to another.
- **Artificial Intelligence**: Machine Learning algorithms enable computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.
