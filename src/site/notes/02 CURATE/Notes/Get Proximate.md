# Get Proximate

- To address societal problems, get proximate.
- Understand the human dynamics close to you and take action on what you can comprehend.

## **Definition**  
Getting proximate means getting close to the people and communities affected by a particular issue in order to better understand and address their needs.

## **Explain Like I'm 5**  
Imagine you have a friend who is sad because they lost their favorite toy. To help them feel better, you need to sit with them, listen to how they feel, and try to find a way to help them. That's getting proximate - being close and caring about what someone else is going through.

## **Visualization**

## **Digging Deeper**
Getting proximate involves actively engaging with individuals and communities impacted by social issues. It means building relationships, listening to their experiences, and understanding their perspectives in order to create meaningful solutions. By getting closer to those affected, we can develop more effective strategies for positive change.

## **Applications**  
- In education: Teachers can get proximate by understanding the challenges students face in their learning environment and adapting teaching methods accordingly.
- In healthcare: Healthcare providers can get proximate by listening to patients' concerns, addressing their needs, and providing personalized care.
- In community development: Organizations can get proximate by working closely with local communities to identify issues, co-create solutions, and empower residents.
- In social justice: Advocates can get proximate by standing in solidarity with marginalized groups, amplifying their voices, and advocating for systemic change.
