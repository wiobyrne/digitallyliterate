# Authenticating Humans 

## **Definition**  
Authenticating humans is the process of verifying a person's identity, usually through some form of identification or verification method.

## **Explain Like I'm 5**  
Imagine you have a secret code that only you know, and when someone asks you for it, you tell them to prove who they are. That's like authenticating humans - making sure they are who they say they are.

## **Visualization**

## **Digging Deeper**
Authenticating humans can be done through various methods such as passwords, biometrics (like fingerprints or facial recognition), smart cards, security questions, or two-factor authentication. This process is crucial for security purposes to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information or resources.

## **Applications**  
- Access control systems in buildings
- Online banking and financial transactions
- Airport security checkpoints
- Social media account verification
