# Data Broker
Data brokers are companies that collect, aggregate, analyze, and sell personal information about individuals, often without their knowledge or explicit consent. They gather data from various public and private sources to create detailed profiles used for marketing, risk assessment, and other purposes.

For beginners, data brokers can be understood as:
- Companies that collect and sell your personal information
- Businesses that create detailed profiles about you by combining data from multiple sources
- Organizations that may know more about your habits and history than you realize
- Entities that make money by trading in personal information

## **Definition**
A data broker is a company that collects, organizes, and sells data about individuals or businesses to other companies for various purposes.

## **Explain Like I'm 5**
Imagine a data broker as a treasure hunter who collects shiny gems (data) from different places and sells them to people who need them for making things like jewelry (targeted ads).

## **Digging Deeper**
Data brokers gather information from various sources such as public records, online activities, surveys, and more.
