# Technical Areas to Address Security

To maintain a robust and secure technological environment, it's essential to focus on certain key technical areas. These areas form the backbone of any security strategy and can significantly reduce the risk of data breaches or cyber attacks.

1. **Access Control:** Implementing rigorous access control measures ensures that only authorized individuals can access sensitive data. This includes password management, two-factor authentication, and managing user privileges.

2. **Network Security:** This involves protecting the usability and integrity of your network and data. It includes both hardware and software technologies that can prevent unauthorized access, misuse, malfunction or destruction.

3. **Application Security:** Application security includes measures taken to improve the security of an application often by finding, fixing and preventing security vulnerabilities.

4. **Data Encryption:** Encryption is a process that encodes a message or information in such a way that only authorized parties can access it.

5. **Firewalls:** A firewall is a network security system designed to prevent unauthorized access to or from a private network.

6. **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS):** These systems monitor networks for malicious activities or policy violations and report them to management.

7. **Regular Audits & Updates**: Regular audits help identify vulnerabilities in your IT systems while regular updates ensure you're protected against known threats.

8. **Backup & Disaster Recovery Plan:** Having a backup plan ensures data is not lost in case of accidental deletion or ransomware attacks while a disaster recovery plan helps restore normal operations after any disaster event.
