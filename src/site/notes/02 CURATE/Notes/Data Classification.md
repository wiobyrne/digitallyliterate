# Data Classification

## Understanding Data Classification in Knowledge Management Systems

Data Classification is a fundamental aspect of knowledge management systems. It involves organizing and categorizing data into various types, classes, or categories to facilitate effective data use, data management, and meet regulatory requirements.

There are generally three types of data classification:

1. Content-based classification: Involves classifying data based on the content within the files. It's often automated using artificial intelligence or machine learning algorithms.

2. Context-based classification: This involves classifying data based on file attributes such as location, creator information, date created etc.

3. User-based classification: This is where data is classified based on the input from users who manually tag and categorize the data.

The primary benefits of data classification include improved efficiency in managing and locating data, better compliance with regulatory requirements, enhanced security by identifying sensitive or critical information, and overall improvement in decision-making processes.
