# 3Cs of consumption, creation, and critique
 media literacy

## **Definition**  
The 3Cs of consumption, creation, and critique refer to the three main activities involved in engaging with media content: consuming (viewing or experiencing), creating (producing or contributing), and critiquing (analyzing or evaluating).

## **Explain Like I'm 5**  
Imagine you have a toy box. First, you play with the toys (consumption). Then, you build something new with them (creation). Finally, you decide which toys are your favorites and why (critique).

## **Digging Deeper**
The 3Cs framework emphasizes the importance of not just passively consuming media but also actively engaging with it. Consumption involves watching videos, reading articles, or listening to podcasts. Creation involves making your own content like videos, blogs, or social media posts. Critique involves analyzing media messages for biases, accuracy, and impact on society.

## **Applications**  
- In education: Teachers can use the 3Cs model to encourage students to think critically about the media they consume and create their own projects.
- In journalism: Journalists can apply the 3Cs to produce accurate news stories while also being mindful of how their content is consumed by the public.
- In marketing: Marketers can use the 3Cs to understand consumer behavior better and create more engaging advertising campaigns.
- In social media: Users can apply the 3Cs to navigate through the vast amount of information available online and make informed decisions about what content to engage with.
- In film studies: Scholars can use the 3Cs framework to analyze movies from different perspectives and understand their cultural significance.
