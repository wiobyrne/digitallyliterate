# China is taking a clever approach to the AI race with DeepSeek. 

Here's how they're getting a head start:

## Building on What's Already There

DeepSeek isn't starting from scratch. They're using existing research and open-source tools to create their AI models. It's like building a house using the best parts of other houses instead of starting with raw materials. This approach saves time and effort.

## Doing More with Less

DeepSeek is achieving results similar to big companies like OpenAI, but with much less money and fewer resources. They've developed their AI model for only about $6 million, which is a tiny fraction of what U.S. companies spend[1]. It's like winning a race without needing the most expensive running shoes.

## Learning from Everyone

By offering their AI for free, DeepSeek is getting valuable feedback and data from users worldwide. This helps them improve their AI based on real-world usage, making it smarter and more useful over time[3].

## Sharing to Grow Faster

DeepSeek has made their AI open-source, meaning anyone can use, modify, or build upon it. This openness encourages global collaboration and speeds up the AI's development. It's like crowdsourcing improvements for their technology[4].

## The Big Picture

This approach is shaking up the AI world. It's challenging the idea that you need massive resources to compete in AI. DeepSeek's success is making big tech companies and investors rethink their strategies[5]. It's also showing that innovation can thrive even with limitations, as DeepSeek had to work around U.S. restrictions on advanced chip exports to China.

In essence, China, through DeepSeek, is cleverly using global knowledge, efficient methods, and collaborative approaches to catch up and potentially lead in the AI race, despite facing some technological restrictions.

## Simplify


China's firm, DeepSeek, is smartly advancing in the AI race by using existing research and cost-effective methods to develop their AI models. They're also encouraging global collaboration by making their AI free and open-source, gaining valuable user feedback to improve their technology. This approach is challenging traditional strategies in the AI field and shows innovation can thrive despite limitations.
