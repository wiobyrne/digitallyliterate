# Artificial Intelligence 

## **Definition**Â Â 
Artificial Intelligence, often referred to as AI, is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems.

## **Explain Like I'm 5**Â Â 
Imagine if you had a toy robot that could learn to clean up your room all by itself â€“ thatâ€™s pretty much what artificial intelligence is. It's teaching machines to learn and make decisions like humans do.

## **Visual Aid**Â Â

|**Limited Intelligence**|**Basic Narrow AI**  <br>ðŸ’¬  <br>Task-Specific AI  <br>Examples: Chatbots, Recommendation Systems  <br>Single-purpose applications|**Emerging AI Systems**  <br>ðŸ”„  <br>Bridging narrow and broad capabilities  <br>Experimental technologies|

## **Digging Deeper**
Artificial Intelligence (AI) involves programming computers to perform tasks usually associated with human intelligence. These tasks include learning from experience, recognizing patterns in vast amounts of data, understanding language, making judgements and decisions, and solving complex problems. AI can be categorized into two types: Narrow AI, which is designed to perform a narrow task such as voice recognition, and General AI, which can perform any intellectual task that a human being can do.

## **Applications**Â Â 
* **Healthcare**: AI can help doctors diagnose diseases based on symptoms or medical imaging.
* **Transportation**: Self-driving cars use AI to navigate roads and traffic.
* **Retail**: Online shopping platforms use AI for personalized recommendations.
* **Finance**: Banks and insurance companies use AI for fraud detection.
