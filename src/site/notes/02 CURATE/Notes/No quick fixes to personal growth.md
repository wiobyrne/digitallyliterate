Emotional intelligence involves understanding, regulating, and expressing emotions, as well as empathizing with others. It's essential for healthy relationships and decision-making.

ðŸŒ± Growth is a journey, not a destination.  
ðŸŒ± Be patient with yourself.  
ðŸŒ± Embrace the process of growth and change over time.
