# Emergence

## **Definition**  
Emergence is the phenomenon where complex systems exhibit properties or behaviors that arise from the interactions of their simpler parts, but are not present in those parts individually.

## **Explain Like I'm 5**  
Imagine a puzzle where each piece is plain, but when you put them all together, a beautiful picture appears. That's like emergence - the whole is more than just the sum of its parts!

## **Visualization**  
*(Insert image or diagram here)*

## **Digging Deeper**
Emergence is seen in various fields such as biology, physics, and sociology. In biology, the behavior of ants in a colony emerges from simple rules each ant follows. In sociology, trends or patterns in a society can emerge from individual interactions and decisions.

## **Applications**  
- Swarm robotics: Emergent behavior in groups of robots working together to achieve a common goal.
- Artificial intelligence: Machine learning algorithms can exhibit emergent behavior when trained on large datasets to perform complex tasks.
- Urban planning: City patterns and traffic flow can be studied using emergent principles to optimize urban design.
