# Agentic AI

## **Definition**  
Agentic AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that are designed to act autonomously and make decisions independently, mimicking human agency.

## **Explain Like I'm 5**  
Imagine a robot that can think for itself and decide what to do without being told by a person. That's what agentic AI is like!

## **Visualization**

## **Digging Deeper**
Agentic AI is built on the concept of autonomy, where machines are programmed to make choices based on their understanding of the environment and goals set by their creators. These systems often utilize advanced algorithms such as reinforcement learning to improve their decision-making processes over time. Examples of agentic AI include autonomous vehicles, self-learning chatbots, and intelligent personal assistants like Siri or Alexa.

## **Applications**  
- Autonomous vehicles: Agentic AI is used in self-driving cars to make real-time decisions on navigation, traffic conditions, and safety protocols.
- Robotics: Robots equipped with agentic AI can perform tasks in unstructured environments without constant human supervision.
- Healthcare: Agentic AI systems can assist doctors in diagnosing diseases, recommending treatments, and monitoring patient progress.
- Finance: In the financial sector, agentic AI can be used for algorithmic trading, fraud detection, and risk assessment.
- Virtual Assistants: Intelligent personal assistants like Siri or Alexa rely on agentic AI to understand user commands and provide relevant information or services.
