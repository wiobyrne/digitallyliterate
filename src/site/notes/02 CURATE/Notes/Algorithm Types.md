# Algorithm Types

There are several types of algorithms, all designed to accomplish different tasks:

- **Search engine algorithm.** This algorithm takes [search strings](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/search-string) of keywords and [operators](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/search-operator) as input, searches its associated database for relevant webpages and returns results.
- **Encryption algorithm.** This computing algorithm transforms data according to specified actions to protect it. A symmetric [key](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/key) algorithm, such as the [Data Encryption Standard](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/Data-Encryption-Standard), for example, uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt data. If the algorithm is sufficiently sophisticated, no one lacking the key can decrypt the data.
- **Greedy algorithm.** This algorithm solves optimization problems by finding the locally optimal solution, hoping it is the optimal solution at the global level. However, it does not guarantee the most optimal solution.
- **Recursive algorithm.** This algorithm calls itself repeatedly until it solves a problem. Recursive algorithms call themselves with a smaller value every time a recursive function is invoked.
- **Backtracking algorithm.** This algorithm finds a solution to a given problem in incremental approaches and solves it one piece at a time.
- **Divide-and-conquer algorithm.** This common algorithm is divided into two parts. One part divides a problem into smaller subproblems. The second part solves these problems and then combines them to produce a solution.
- **Dynamic programming algorithm.** This algorithm solves problems by dividing them into subproblems. The results are then stored to be applied to future corresponding problems.
- **Brute-force algorithm.** This algorithm iterates all possible solutions to a problem blindly, searching for one or more solutions to a function.
- **Sorting algorithm.** Sorting algorithms are used to rearrange [data structures](https://www.techtarget.com/searchdatamanagement/definition/data-structure) based on a comparison operator, which is used to decide a new order for data.
- **Hashing algorithm.** This algorithm takes data and converts it into a uniform message with a [hashing](https://www.techtarget.com/searchdatamanagement/definition/hashing).
- **Randomized algorithm.** This algorithm reduces running times and time-based complexities. It uses random elements as part of its logic.
