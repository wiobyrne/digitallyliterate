# Bias

## **Definition**  
Bias refers to a tendency to lean in a certain direction, usually without considering all the facts or information. It can influence decisions, judgments, and behaviors.

## **Explain Like I'm 5**  
Imagine you have a favorite color and always choose things that are that color, even if there are other good options. That's like bias - picking something because you like it without looking at everything else.

## **Visualization**

## **Digging Deeper**
Bias can come from personal experiences, beliefs, stereotypes, or even unconscious thoughts. In AI and machine learning, bias can creep into algorithms if the data used to train them is not diverse enough or reflects existing biases in society. This can lead to unfair outcomes or discrimination against certain groups. To address bias in AI systems, researchers and developers work on techniques like data preprocessing, algorithmic fairness, and bias mitigation strategies.

Everyone has bias. That’s not the problem — unexamined bias is. The goal here isn’t to pretend we’re all objective — it’s to **recognize** those biases and account for them. You have to apply the same critical lens to LLMs. They’re not “lying,” but they’re trained to give useful, safe, approved answers — and that often reflects **institutional, cultural, or political assumptions** baked into their design.


## **Applications**  
- Hiring processes: Bias can affect decisions made in recruitment and hiring processes if certain groups of people are favored over others.
- Healthcare: Bias in medical algorithms could lead to misdiagnosis or unequal treatment for patients from different backgrounds.
- Criminal justice: Biased algorithms could impact sentencing decisions and contribute to disparities in the justice system.
- Marketing: Targeted advertising may show bias towards specific demographics based on assumptions about consumer behavior.
- Education: Bias in educational tools and assessments could influence student outcomes unfairly.
