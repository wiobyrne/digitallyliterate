# Self-efficacy  

## **Definition**

Self-efficacy is an individual's belief in their ability to successfully perform a specific task or achieve a particular goal. It affects motivation, behavior, and achievement across various domains.

## **Explain Like I'm 5**

Self-efficacy is like saying, "I think I can!" before trying something hard. If you’ve built a tall block tower before, you believe you can do it again—even taller this time.

## **Digging Deeper**

Self-efficacy, a concept grounded in Bandura’s Social Cognitive Theory, refers to task-specific confidence. It differs from general self-confidence, which is broader and not tied to specific outcomes. Self-efficacy is shaped by past experiences, social modeling, feedback, and emotional states. For example, succeeding at math problems, seeing peers succeed, receiving positive feedback, and feeling calm can all boost one’s self-efficacy in math.

While often used interchangeably with confidence, self-efficacy is more dynamic and situation-dependent. Confidence is based on evidence about external outcomes, while self-confidence and self-efficacy are internally focused on one’s own perceived capabilities. Overconfidence, however, can negatively affect performance by fostering unrealistic expectations and insufficient preparation.

Self-efficacy influences goal setting, resilience, and persistence. High self-efficacy leads to greater motivation and willingness to tackle challenges, while low self-efficacy can lead to avoidance and anxiety.

## **Applications**

- **Education**: Boosting students’ belief in their ability to learn improves academic performance and persistence.
    
- **Workplace Training**: Employees with high self-efficacy are more likely to engage with challenging tasks and upskilling programs.
    
- **Health Behavior Change**: Self-efficacy is key in programs for smoking cessation, weight loss, or chronic disease management.
    
- **Sports Coaching**: Athletes’ performance and motivation improve when they believe in their capacity to succeed.
    
- **Therapy and Counseling**: Enhancing self-efficacy can support treatment for anxiety, depression, and trauma recovery.
