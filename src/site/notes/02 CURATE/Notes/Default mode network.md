# Default Mode Network

## Overview
- The Default Mode Network (DMN) is like the "idle" mode of our brain. Imagine when you're not doing anything, your brain switches to this "default" mode. It's when you start daydreaming or thinking about yourself and others. This network in our brain gets activated when we're not focused on the outside world and the brain is at wakeful rest, like during daydreaming or mind-wandering.

- **Notes:** *The DMN has been linked to several mental disorders including depression, ADHD, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer's disease.*

## Development
- The DMN plays a crucial role in our understanding of the human brain. It's interesting because it suggests that our brains are always active, even when we're not consciously thinking or focused on a task. This could have implications for how we understand mental health and cognitive function. For example, disruptions in the DMN have been linked to mental health disorders such as depression and ADHD. Understanding this could lead to new treatment approaches.

## Next Steps
- Further research is needed to understand why and how disruptions in the DMN occur, as well as their impact on cognitive function and mental health. It would also be interesting to explore how interventions such as mindfulness meditation might impact the functioning of the DMN.
