# Talking to My Notes: How AI Helped Me Rethink What I Know

For a long time, I thought of my notes, my research, my teaching reflections, my reading highlights, as something I wrote _for later_. A resource I might come back to if I needed to prepare a talk, write a blog post, or plan a workshop.

But what if those notes could _talk back_?

That’s the question that started shifting how I think about digital literacy, personal knowledge, and artificial intelligence. And it all started with something very simple: uploading some documents into a tool called **NotebookLM**.

Let me explain how that one small action opened the door to a whole new way of thinking—and working.

## 📚 From Saving Notes to Talking With Them

Over the years, I’ve collected _a lot_ of material—800 blog posts, 400+ newsletters, book notes, research, teaching materials, questions I’m still trying to answer.

I keep everything organized in a system called Obsidian, which lets me build a kind of digital garden—interconnected notes where ideas can grow over time.

But organizing isn’t the same as **using**. I wanted something more: a way to ask my notes questions. To learn _with_ them, not just from them.

That’s when I started using **NotebookLM**, a tool from Google that lets you upload documents and “chat” with them using AI. You can think of it like this:

> 💡 It’s like having a smart research assistant who has read all your notes and is ready to help you make sense of them.

So I gave it a try.

## 🤖 My First AI Learning Partner: NotebookLM

I uploaded a batch of materials from my teaching and research—blog posts, course notes, workshop slides, article highlights—and started asking questions.

- “How do I define digital literacy in my own work?”
    
- “What connections have I made between student identity and AI policy?”
    
- “What did I say about bias in generative AI in that reflection I wrote last year?”
    

And it answered.

Not in generic, Google-search-style blurbs—but in thoughtful, detailed summaries that pulled directly from my own work. I was, in a very real way, _talking to myself_—past versions of me, stitched together by the AI.

That’s when the lightbulb turned on. I wasn’t just using AI to find answers—I was using it to **understand myself better**.

## 🧠 A New Way to Use AI: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

As I learned more, I found out there’s a name for this way of working: **RAG**, or **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**.

That might sound complicated, but here’s the simple version:

> 🧵 Most AI models (like ChatGPT) are trained on huge amounts of data—but they don’t know _your_ notes, your projects, or your brain.
> 
> 📁 RAG is a method that lets you connect AI to your personal documents, so it can _retrieve_ your materials and use them when answering your questions.

Think of it like this:

|Without RAG|With RAG|
|---|---|
|AI gives general answers based on public info|AI gives you personalized answers based on _your_ work|
|You search for meaning on your own|The AI helps you find patterns in what you’ve already created|
|You write, save, and forget|You write, save, and _interact_ with your notes|

NotebookLM was my first real experience with this. It helped me see that my collection of ideas wasn't just a reference library—it could be a **living, responsive knowledge system**.

## 🧪 My RAG Workflow Today: A Digital Garden That Talks Back

Since that experiment, I’ve gone deeper.

Now, I build and connect my notes in **Obsidian**, my favorite tool for personal knowledge management. It lets me link ideas, organize them in stages (like Seeds → Plants → Evergreens), and map out relationships between concepts.

Then, using tools like NotebookLM—or other RAG-enabled AI apps—I can _ask questions across my entire vault_:

- What have I written about equity in AI education?
    
- Where have I connected digital identity with student agency?
    
- What questions am I still exploring around cognitive load and design?
    

The AI doesn’t just pull quotes—it helps me **synthesize**. It shows patterns. It surfaces connections I missed. It becomes a kind of learning partner—one that knows my language, my interests, my gaps.

## 🧰 Tips for Making Your Notes “AI-Ready”

Here’s what I’ve learned about writing for AI—and for future-you:

1. **Keep notes short and focused**  
    → One idea per note works better than long walls of text.
    
2. **Use consistent terms**  
    → If you say “digital literacy” in one place and “digital fluency” in another, the AI might not connect them unless you link them explicitly.
    
3. **Document questions, not just answers**  
    → The things you’re wondering about are just as useful as the things you “know.”
    
4. **Link ideas together**  
    → Backlinks and tags make it easier for both you _and_ your AI partner to navigate your thinking.
    
5. **Update and review regularly**  
    → Your thinking changes—your notes should grow with you.

## 🌱 What This Means for Teaching and Research

I’ve started using this RAG-based workflow in everything I do:

- In **teaching**, I can pull relevant reflections or readings while planning a session—based on real experience.
    
- In **research**, I can see where my ideas are growing or stuck, and what themes I return to.
    
- In **writing**, I can maintain consistency across blog posts, papers, and talks—without reinventing the wheel.
    

And I share it all in my [digital garden](https://digitallyliterate.net)—a public, evolving space where ideas can grow and others can explore along with me.

## 🔮 Looking Ahead: AI That Understands _You_

This shift—from AI as encyclopedia to AI as _thinking partner_—isn’t just technical. It’s philosophical. It changes how we view knowledge, learning, and ourselves.

In future posts, I’ll be exploring:

- How to build your own digital garden in Obsidian
    
- How to connect AI to your notes using tools like NotebookLM
    
- How RAG is powering new tools like Model Context Protocol (MCP), which make this easier than ever
    

But for now, here’s the big takeaway:

> 🧠 AI is most powerful when it knows what _you_ know.  
> Your notes, your questions, your learning journey—they’re not just personal. They’re powerful. And when you connect them to the right tools, they become your **superpower**.

## 🤔 What Would You Ask Your Notes?

If your notes could talk back, what would you want to know?  
What patterns would you hope to see?  
What new questions might you finally be ready to ask?

That’s what retrieval-augmented learning can unlock.  
And it starts with something as simple as opening a notebook and asking a better question.

Let’s keep learning—and growing—together. 🌿




## First Draft - Too complex

### Turning Your Knowledge Into Your AI's Superpower: Understanding RAG

I've been thinking a lot lately about how we can make AI more useful for learning and knowledge work. The breakthrough isn't just having access to powerful AI models—it's connecting them to your personal knowledge in meaningful ways.

That's where RAG comes in, and it's changing how I think about digital gardens, note-taking, and AI-assisted learning.

## What is RAG?

RAG stands for **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**. It's a fancy term for a simple concept: instead of just relying on what an AI model learned during training, you give it access to your specific documents, notes, and knowledge base to inform its responses.

Think of it this way:

- **Standard AI** is like having a really smart research assistant who has read millions of books but can't access your personal notes, research, or specific context.
    
- **RAG-enhanced AI** is like giving that same assistant access to your filing cabinet, your highlighted books, your research notes, and your personal insights—so they can give you answers that are both generally intelligent and specifically relevant to your work.
    

## Why This Matters for Knowledge Workers

Most AI interactions happen in a vacuum. You ask ChatGPT or Claude a question, and they respond based on their training data—which might be general, outdated, or missing your specific context.

But what if your AI could:

- Reference your personal research notes when answering questions?
- Pull from your curated collection of articles and books?
- Build on your existing thoughts and frameworks?
- Connect new information to your established knowledge base?

That's the power of RAG. It transforms AI from a general-purpose tool into a personalized thinking partner.

## RAG in Action: My Digital Garden Experiment

Let me share a concrete example. I've been experimenting with connecting AI to my digital garden—my collection of 500+ interconnected notes on digital literacy, AI, education, and research.

**Without RAG**, when I ask an AI about "digital literacy in higher education," I get generic responses based on broad training data.

**With RAG**, the AI can access my specific notes on:

- My research on student digital identity development
- Highlights from books I've read on the topic
- My workshop materials and teaching experiences
- Connections I've made between digital literacy and AI policy
- Questions I'm still exploring in my own work

The difference is remarkable. Instead of generic advice, I get responses that build on my existing knowledge, reference my specific frameworks, and help me see new connections within my own thinking.

## Beyond NotebookLM: The Broader RAG Landscape

Many people first encounter RAG through tools like Google's NotebookLM, which lets you upload documents and chat with them. I've used NotebookLM extensively with my digital garden content, and it's impressive—you can literally have conversations with your notes.

But RAG extends far beyond single-purpose tools:

**Research Applications:**

- Upload your literature reviews and have AI help synthesize themes
- Connect new papers to your existing research framework
- Generate research questions based on gaps in your knowledge base

**Teaching and Course Development:**

- Create AI tutors trained on your specific curriculum
- Generate practice questions from your course materials
- Help students connect new concepts to previously covered material

**Writing and Content Creation:**

- Reference your entire body of work while writing new pieces
- Maintain consistency across long-form projects
- Generate ideas that build on your established expertise

**Personal Knowledge Management:**

- Ask questions that span your entire note collection
- Discover connections between ideas you hadn't noticed
- Get summaries that reflect your specific interests and frameworks

## The Technical Magic (Made Simple)

Here's what happens behind the scenes with RAG:

1. **Indexing**: Your documents get broken into chunks and converted into mathematical representations (embeddings)
2. **Retrieval**: When you ask a question, the system finds the most relevant chunks from your knowledge base
3. **Augmentation**: Those relevant pieces get added to your question as context
4. **Generation**: The AI generates a response informed by both its training and your specific materials

You don't need to understand the technical details, but knowing this process helps you optimize your knowledge base for better RAG performance.

## Making Your Knowledge RAG-Ready

Not all knowledge bases work equally well with RAG. Here's what I've learned about organizing information for AI retrieval:

**Write Clear, Self-Contained Notes:** Each note should make sense on its own. RAG systems retrieve chunks of text, so context matters.

**Use Consistent Terminology:** If you call something "digital literacy" in one note and "digital fluency" in another, the AI might miss connections.

**Include Your Questions and Uncertainties:** Don't just document what you know—document what you're exploring. This helps AI assist with your active thinking.

**Connect Ideas Explicitly:** While AI can find implicit connections, explicit links and references make retrieval more reliable.

**Regular Review and Curation:** RAG systems work best with high-quality, regularly updated knowledge bases.

## The Learning Partnership

What excites me most about RAG isn't the technology—it's the pedagogical possibilities. When AI can access your knowledge base, it becomes a thinking partner that grows with you.

It can:

- Help you see patterns across your notes that you missed
- Suggest connections between old ideas and new information
- Generate questions that push your thinking forward
- Support you in synthesizing large amounts of personal research

This isn't about replacing human thinking—it's about amplifying it. RAG-enhanced AI becomes an extension of your cognitive toolkit, helping you work with your knowledge in new ways.

## Looking Ahead

RAG is still evolving rapidly. We're seeing better retrieval algorithms, more sophisticated chunking strategies, and tools that make personal RAG systems easier to build and maintain.

In my next post, I'll dive into MCP (Model Context Protocol)—a new standard that's making it easier to connect AI models directly to your knowledge management tools. It's the bridge between your digital garden and AI assistance, and it's opening up possibilities I'm just beginning to explore.

For now, I encourage you to think about your own knowledge base differently. Those notes you've been taking, those articles you've been saving, those ideas you've been developing—they're not just personal archives. They're the foundation for a personalized AI learning system.

The question isn't whether AI will transform how we work with knowledge. It's whether we'll be ready to work with AI in ways that amplify our thinking rather than replace it.

What would you ask your notes if they could talk back? That's the question RAG is helping us answer.
