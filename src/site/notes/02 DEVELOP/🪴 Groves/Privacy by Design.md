# Privacy by Design

*Tools That Protect You by Default*

> Privacy should be built into technology from the start, not added as an afterthought.

---

## What is Privacy by Design?

Think of it like a house built with strong locks on every door and window by default — you shouldn't have to install the locks after moving in.

Tools that follow privacy-by-design principles **protect your information automatically**, so you don't need to be a tech expert to stay safe. The key insight: **the tool itself does the privacy work**, not you.

**Example:** An online document editor with privacy by design will encrypt your notes automatically. Even the server hosting it can't read what you write. You just... use it. The privacy happens in the background.

---

## Why This Matters

Every platform we use either reinforces extractive digital practices or models a cooperative, privacy-respecting alternative.

**Tool choices become pedagogy.** When we choose privacy-first tools, we're not just protecting ourselves — we're demonstrating that alternatives exist and work.

---

## Core Principle

**Zero-knowledge architecture**: The service provider cannot access your data, even if they wanted to. Your encryption keys stay with you.

This is different from "we promise not to look" — it's "we literally cannot look."

---

### Community Chat: [[Matrix\|Matrix]]/Element 🔸

**Discord/Slack alternative you can actually control.**

| What | Why |
|------|-----|
| End-to-end encryption | All messages protected |
| Federation | No single point of failure or control |
| Self-hostable | Run your own server if you want |
| Bridges | Connect to Discord/Slack during transition |

| What | Why |
|------|-----|
| Complete data sovereignty | Your servers, your data |
| Full productivity suite | Files, calendar, contacts, office |

| 300+ apps | Extend functionality as needed |

**Getting Started:** Use a cooperative host like CommonsCloud, or self-host with Docker.

**Cost:** Cooperative hosting €0.50-15/user/month → Self-hosted $75-150/month

## Quick Reference

| Need | Privacy-First Solution | Alternative | Why It Protects |
|------|------------------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Documents | **CryptPad** | HedgeDoc | Zero-knowledge encryption |
| Messaging | **Signal** | Session | End-to-end encryption by default |
| Community | **Matrix/Element** | Rocket.Chat | Encrypted + federated |
| Files | **Nextcloud** | Proton Drive | Community ownership |

## Making the Switch

### Start Simple
1. **Pick one tool** — Signal is usually easiest
2. **Use it alongside** your current tools
3. **Invite others** — privacy works better together
4. **Gradually migrate** as you get comfortable

### For Communities
1. **Identify champions** who learn deeply and help others
2. **Run parallel systems** during transition
3. **Frame it as learning** not just a tech swap
4. **Decide together** — democratic governance matters

---

## Common Concerns

**"This sounds hard."**
→ Start with Signal. It's as easy as regular texting.

**"I'm not technical."**
→ Privacy-by-design means the tool does the work, not you.

**"What if it breaks?"**
→ Cooperative hosts provide professional maintenance and backups.

**"Can we afford this?"**
→ Many tools are free. Paid options often cost less than what you're giving away in data.
