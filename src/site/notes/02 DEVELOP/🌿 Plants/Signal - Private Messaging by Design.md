# Signal - Private Messaging by Design

*A practical example of privacy by design in everyday communication.*

Signal is one of the clearest examples of what **privacy by design** looks like in practice. Instead of asking users to manually secure every setting, the app is built so that protection is the default.

Messages are encrypted automatically. Metadata is minimized. The system is designed to know as little about you as possible.

But tools only reduce risk through architecture. They cannot replace good judgment or healthy communication habits.
For the social layer of safety, see [[03 CREATE/🪴 Groves/Security Culture as Digital Literacy\|Security Culture as Digital Literacy]].

## What Signal Is (and Isn't)

**Signal is:**

- End-to-end encrypted by default
- Open source and independently audited
- Designed to minimize data collection
- Built so even the company cannot read your messages

**Signal is not:**

- A guarantee of safety
- Protection from poor sharing habits
- A replacement for trust and communication norms

Encryption protects messages. People protect each other.

---

## Start Here (Basics)

For most people, a simple setup is enough:

- Install Signal and verify your number
- Turn on **Registration Lock**
- Enable **Screen Lock**
- Set **Default Disappearing Messages** (e.g., 1 week)
- Start with one or two trusted contacts

This covers 95% of everyday needs.

---

## Everyday Habits

Signal works best when it feels ordinary and boring.

- Use it for conversations that matter
- Avoid forwarding screenshots into less secure spaces
- Treat chats like conversations, not archives
- Keep groups small and purpose-bound

These habits often matter more than any advanced setting.

## Privacy Settings Reference

Signal's defaults are already better than most apps. These settings take it further.

### Essential (do these first)

| Setting | Where to Find It | What It Does |
|---------|------------------|--------------|
| Registration Lock | Settings → Account | Prevents someone from hijacking your account by re-registering your number |
| Screen Lock | Settings → Privacy | Requires biometrics/PIN to open Signal after you leave the app |
| Phone number → "nobody" | Settings → Privacy → Phone Number | Hides your number from other users and prevents discovery by number |
| Default disappearing messages | Settings → Privacy → Disappearing Messages | New chats auto-delete after your chosen time (e.g., 1 week) |

### Recommended

| Setting | Where to Find It | What It Does |
|---------|------------------|--------------|
| Screen security (Android) / Hide in app switcher (iOS) | Settings → Privacy | Blocks screenshots inside the app (Android); hides preview in app switcher (iOS) |
| Incognito keyboard (Android) | Settings → Privacy | Prevents your keyboard app from logging what you type in Signal |
| Always relay calls | Settings → Privacy → Advanced | Routes calls through Signal servers so the other person never sees your IP address |
| Username | Settings → Profile | Lets people contact you without knowing your phone number |

### Situational

| Setting | Where to Find It | What It Does |
|---------|------------------|--------------|
| App icon disguise | Settings → Appearance → App icon | Changes Signal's icon to look like a generic app (Android also changes the name) |
| Safety number verification | Tap contact's profile → View safety number | Confirms no one is intercepting your conversation; verify in person via QR scan or over video call |
| Note to self | Conversations → "Note to Self" | A private channel for saving photos/files with minimal metadata |

These features reduce digital "breadcrumbs," but they are secondary to communication discipline.

## What Signal Can't Protect Against

Encryption protects messages in transit. It does not protect the device they live on.

- A lost or confiscated phone exposes all messages still on it (use disappearing messages and screen lock)
- A malicious QR code can link an attacker's device to your account (only scan linked-device QR codes you initiated yourself)
- Screenshots taken by other people in a chat can't be prevented by your settings
- Someone with physical access to an unlocked phone has access to everything on it

These risks are social and physical, not cryptographic. That's why [[03 CREATE/🪴 Groves/Security Culture as Digital Literacy\|Security Culture as Digital Literacy]] matters alongside good tools.

---

## When Signal Helps Most

Signal is especially useful for:

- School or leadership teams
- Family coordination
- Community organizations
- Sensitive logistical planning

Not because something secret is happening, but because **people deserve conversations that aren't automatically recorded and monetized**.
