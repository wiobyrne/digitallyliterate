# Theory of Mind

## **Definition**Â Â 
Theory of Mind refers to the ability to understand that others have thoughts, beliefs, desires, and intentions that are different from one's own.

## **Explain Like I'm 5**Â Â 
Imagine you have a toy car hidden in a box. Your friend comes over and you move the car to a different box without them seeing. Theory of Mind is knowing that your friend doesn't know where the car is because they didn't see you move it.

## **Digging Deeper**
Theory of Mind is a crucial cognitive skill that allows us to recognize and interpret other people's mental states. It involves understanding that others may have different beliefs, thoughts, emotions, and intentions than our own. This ability plays a significant role in social interactions, communication, empathy, and predicting behavior.

For example, if someone believes it's raining outside while you know it's sunny because you looked out the window recently, Theory of Mind allows you to understand their perspective even if it differs from your own.
