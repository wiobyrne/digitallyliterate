## Definition
Just So stories are simplistic evolutionary explanations that lack empirical support and often reinforce biological deterministic thinking.

## Critical Analysis

# Just So stories
Just So stories - misusing evolutionary theory to reinforce biological determinism. 

Just So stories are simplistic and unfounded narratives that attribute the origin of certain traits or behaviors to natural selection, without providing any empirical evidence or considering alternative explanations. They are often used to justify biological determinism, the idea that human nature and social roles are fixed and inevitable by genetic factors.

The term Just So stories refers to the fictional tales by Rudyard Kipling that explain how animals acquired their distinctive features. In evolutionary biology, it is used as a pejorative label for adaptationist explanations that rely on speculation and circular reasoning, rather than empirical data and rigorous testing. Such explanations can also support biological determinism, the doctrine that human characteristics and social structures are determined by genes and cannot be changed by environmental or cultural factors.

Just So stories are speculative and untestable accounts of how natural selection shaped certain traits or behaviors in organisms. They often ignore the complexity and contingency of evolutionary processes and the role of non-adaptive factors, such as drift, mutation, or developmental constraints. By presenting traits or behaviors as optimal and inevitable adaptations, they can also reinforce biological determinism, the belief that human biology determines human destiny and social order.
