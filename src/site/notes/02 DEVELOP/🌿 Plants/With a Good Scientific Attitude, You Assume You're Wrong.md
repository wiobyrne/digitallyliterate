# With a Good Scientific Attitude, You Assume You're Wrong

The hallmark of a true scientific attitude isn't the pursuit of being right; it is the aggressive, disciplined attempt to prove oneself wrong. In popular culture, the scientist is often portrayed as a figure of absolute authority, standing behind a podium and delivering "The Truth." But in the trenches of actual discovery—where the "folks doing science" live—the mindset is far more humble and, paradoxically, far more robust. It is a state of perpetual, constructive doubt.

### The Discipline of the "Null Hypothesis"

In formal research, we don't start by trying to prove our favorite idea. We start with the **null hypothesis**—the assumption that there is no effect, no relationship, and no "miracle" occurring. The job of the scientist is to try as hard as possible to support that null hypothesis. Only when every attempt to debunk the idea fails do we tentatively accept that something might be there.

Assuming you are wrong is a defense mechanism against **confirmation bias**, the human tendency to see only the data that fits our pre-existing narrative. If you go into a project "believing" your own theory, you will subconsciously ignore the outliers, the "leaky pipes" in your data, and the inconvenient anomalies. By assuming you are wrong from the outset, you turn your skepticism into a filter that only allows the most resilient truths to pass through.

### Intellectual Sovereignty and the Pivot

This attitude is what separates a scientist from a dogmatist. A dogmatist views a challenge to their theory as a personal attack; a scientist views it as a gift. If a data point contradicts your model, it means the model is incomplete. That contradiction is the "map" telling you that the "territory" is more complex than you thought.

In the world of digital literacy and AI, this mindset is vital. When we build a knowledge system, we make assumptions about how information should flow. If we assume our system is perfect, we become slaves to its friction. If we assume our design is flawed, we stay agile. We keep looking for the ways the "pipes" might be misaligned, which allows us to pivot before the system collapses.

### Satisficing with Skepticism

There is a tension here between **satisficing** and **scientific rigor**. To get anything done, we must eventually decide that a theory is "good enough" for now. However, a good scientific attitude means that even when we "satisfice" to move a project forward, we keep a mental note that the foundation is made of provisional assumptions.

We use the theory as a tool, but we don't mistake the tool for the reality. We "believe" in the results only insofar as they haven't been debunked yet. This is the "miracle" of the scientific attitude: by constantly trying to tear down our own work, we end up building structures that are strong enough to stand.

### Conclusion

"Assuming you're wrong" isn't about a lack of confidence; it is the ultimate form of intellectual honesty. It acknowledges that the universe is vast and our "pipes" for understanding it are narrow. When folks doing science embrace their own fallibility, they stop being defenders of an old idea and become explorers of a new one. They recognize that the most exciting phrase in a lab isn't "I found it!" but rather, "That's weird... I must have done something wrong."
