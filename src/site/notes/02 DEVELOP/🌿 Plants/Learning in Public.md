# Learning in Public

## **Definition**  
Learning in public is the practice of sharing your learning journey, progress, and knowledge openly with others, often through social media, blogs, or public platforms.

## **Explain Like I'm 5**  
Learning in public is like showing your friends how you build a LEGO set and explaining each step as you go along. You're not just learning by yourself; you're teaching others too!

## **Digging Deeper**
Learning in public involves transparently documenting your learning process, challenges faced, resources used, and insights gained. By sharing your journey publicly, you not only reinforce your own understanding but also contribute to the collective knowledge of a community. This practice can help you stay accountable, receive feedback from others, and inspire fellow learners.

## **Applications**
