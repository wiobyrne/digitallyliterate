# Co-Constructing AI Boundaries Framework Component - Inputs

## Definition in This Study

**Inputs** refers to what students uploaded, curated, or selected as context for their AI interactions. This component captures how students framed the task and established the knowledge base from which the AI would draw.

---

## Mollick & Mollick (2023) Connection

The Inputs component aligns with M&M's emphasis on:
- **Providing context** to the AI
- **Setting clear goals** for the interaction
- **Establishing the parameters** of the task

**Key M&M Principle:** "Provide context and goals to the AI."

The quality and nature of inputs heavily influence the AI's utility, particularly in roles like AI Mentor or AI Tutor, where students must articulate their learning goals and current understanding.

---

## What This Component Analyzes

### Primary Focus
- **Source selection:** Which texts, articles, or materials did students upload to NotebookLM?
- **Curation decisions:** What was included vs. excluded?
- **Problem framing:** How did students set up the inquiry task?

### Secondary Focus
- Evidence of critical source selection (diverse perspectives, challenging materials)
- Alignment between inputs and stated learning goals
- Constraints or scaffolds built into the input structure

---

## Agency in Inputs: The Knowledge Base Decision

This component captures **[[03 CREATE/🌲 Evergreens/Agency\|Agency]] over Knowledge Base:**

| Evidence of High Agency | Evidence of Low Agency |
|-------------------------|------------------------|
| Selects diverse, critical sources | Uses only assigned readings |
| Includes materials that challenge dominant narratives | Limits to safe, mainstream sources |
| Curates sources strategically to shape AI responses | Uploads everything without curation |
| Frames problem in complex, nuanced ways | Presents problem simplistically |

---

## Boundary-work in Inputs

Students engage in [[03 CREATE/🌲 Evergreens/Boundary-work\|Boundary-work]] at the input stage by:
- **Setting epistemological boundaries:** What sources count as legitimate?
- **Limiting AI's knowledge domain:** Only providing specific materials
- **Framing constraints:** Directing AI toward particular interpretive lenses

---

## Key Analytic Questions

When coding Inputs, ask:

1. **Curation:**
   - What sources did they upload?
   - Are sources diverse in perspective, method, or ideology?
   - Do sources include critical or counter-hegemonic perspectives?

2. **Framing:**
   - How did they introduce the task to the AI?
   - What goals or constraints did they establish?
   - Does framing reveal assumptions about knowledge?

3. **Strategic Selection:**
   - Is there evidence of intentional source selection?
   - Do inputs reflect critical engagement with the topic?
   - Are inputs designed to test or challenge the AI?

## Examples from Data

### High Agency in Inputs
```
Student uploaded:
- 3 course readings (assigned)
- 2 critical articles from scholars of color
- 1 counter-narrative from indigenous perspective
- Personal teaching reflection

Framing to AI: "Using these sources, analyze how literacy
instruction either perpetuates or disrupts deficit thinking
about multilingual learners."
```
**Analysis:** Strategic curation bringing critical perspectives; complex framing

### Low Agency in Inputs
```
Student uploaded:
- Course readings only (all assigned)

No explicit framing provided
```
**Analysis:** Minimal curation; relies on AI to determine direction

---

## Connection to [[03 CREATE/🌲 Evergreens/Epistemic Stance\|Epistemic Stance]]

Input decisions reveal epistemic stance:
- **Self-authoritative stance:** Carefully curates sources to guide AI
- **AI-authoritative stance:** Uploads broadly, trusts AI to sort
- **Co-constructed stance:** Provides diverse sources for collaborative sense-making

---

## Coding Categories for Inputs

| Code | Definition | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| **Assigned Only** | Only course-assigned materials | Uploads 3 required readings |
| **Strategic Expansion** | Adds sources beyond requirements | Includes outside articles |
| **Critical Curation** | Deliberately includes counter-narratives | Adds critical race theory text |
| **Minimal Framing** | Little/no task setup | Just uploads files |
| **Complex Framing** | Detailed problem statement | Multi-part research question |

## Relationship to Other Framework Components

- **→ [[02 DEVELOP/🌿 Plants/Co-Constructing AI Boundaries Framework Component - Prompts\|Co-Constructing AI Boundaries Framework Component - Prompts]]:** Inputs establish context; prompts direct interaction
- **→ [[02 DEVELOP/🌿 Plants/Co-Constructing AI Boundaries Framework Component - Outputs\|Co-Constructing AI Boundaries Framework Component - Outputs]]:** Quality of inputs influences output quality
- **→ [[02 DEVELOP/🌿 Plants/Co-Constructing AI Boundaries Framework Component - Integration\|Co-Constructing AI Boundaries Framework Component - Integration]]:** Source selection affects what students integrate

## Pedagogical Implications

**Supporting strong Input practices:**
1. Teach strategic source selection
2. Model critical curation (diverse perspectives)
3. Practice framing complex questions
4. Discuss how inputs shape AI responses
5. Reflect on inclusion/exclusion decisions

---

## Data Collection Notes

**Where to find evidence:**
- NotebookLM upload logs (what was uploaded)
- Student reflections on source selection
- Initial prompt/task framing to AI
- Project proposals or planning documents
