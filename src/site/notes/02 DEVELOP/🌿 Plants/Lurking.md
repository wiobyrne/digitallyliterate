## Definition
Lurking refers to passive participation in online learning environments, where individuals observe and learn without actively contributing to discussions or activities.

## Connection to Learning Theory

# Lurking



In previous research on MOOCs, we recognized the role of the "lurker." In a traditional learning sense, it's hard to quantify how much the lurker has actually learned, or gained from the experience. But...I think we both would agree that we learn just by being in the context. That is to say, if I want to learn any task, skill, or practice...being around others doing it will add to my knowledge base.

Somewhere in my past, someone pushed back against the label of the "lurker" and suggested something far more positive in tone. I forget what it was because of my monkey mind...it's in my notes somewhere.

In terms of this topic, I'm interested in the contexts of ghosting and orbiting, and how that connects to learning and how we engage fully, watch from a distance, or peace out and move on.

More specifically, what are possible connections between MOOCs, lurking/learning online...and orbiting?
