# Signal Group Hygiene & Communication Norms

*Tools protect messages. Habits protect people.*

Signal can provide strong encryption, but most risk doesn't come from broken technology. It comes from how groups share information with each other.

Security culture is the difference between a protected tool and a protected community.

This note focuses on the **human layer** of communication: how we structure chats, what we share, and how we reduce unnecessary risk for one another.

---

## 1. Keep groups small and purpose-bound

Large "everything" chats create noise and accidental oversharing.

Instead, create groups for:

- one project
- one event
- one team

When a group has a clear purpose, people share more thoughtfully.

Small groups are easier to trust and easier to care for.

---

## 2. Set scope up front

A short, pinned message can prevent confusion:

> This group is for coordinating the field trip only.

Clear boundaries reduce both anxiety and clutter.

People don't have to guess what belongs.

---

## 3. Practice information half-life

Not every message needs to live forever.

Disappearing messages can:

- reduce digital clutter
- lower cognitive load
- limit accidental exposure

Letting information decay is often an act of care, not secrecy.

---

## 4. Onboard intentionally

When someone joins a group, explain:

- what gets shared here
- what doesn't
- how decisions are communicated
- where to ask questions

Security culture is learned socially, not configured technically.

---

## 5. Reduce alert fatigue

When everything feels urgent, nothing is.

Avoid:

- forwarding rumors
- constant notifications
- off-topic chatter
- panic-driven messages

Clear, relevant information helps groups make better decisions.

(See [[03 CREATE/🪴 Groves/Alert Fatigue & Information Hygiene\|Alert Fatigue & Information Hygiene]])

---

## 6. Treat communication as care

Before sharing, pause:

- Who needs this?
- Is this the right channel?
- Would a smaller conversation be better?

These small choices protect others from carrying information they don't need to carry.

*Healthy communication isn't about secrecy. It's about respect for the people in the conversation.*
