# Signal Group Hygiene & Communication Norms

*Tools protect messages. Habits protect people.*

Signal can provide strong encryption, but most risk doesn't come from broken technology. It comes from how groups share information with each other.

Security culture is the difference between a protected tool and a protected community.

This note focuses on the **human layer** of communication: how we structure chats, what we share, and how we reduce unnecessary risk for one another.

---

## 1. Keep groups small and purpose-bound

Large "everything" chats create noise and accidental oversharing.

Instead, create groups for:

- one project
- one event
- one team

When a group has a clear purpose, people share more thoughtfully.

Small groups are easier to trust and easier to care for.

---

## 2. Set scope up front

A short, pinned message can prevent confusion:

> This group is for coordinating the field trip only.

Clear boundaries reduce both anxiety and clutter.

People don't have to guess what belongs.

---

## 3. Practice information half-life

Not every message needs to live forever.

Disappearing messages can:

- reduce digital clutter
- lower cognitive load
- limit accidental exposure

Letting information decay is often an act of care, not secrecy.

## 4. Use admin controls intentionally

Signal gives group admins tools that map directly to trust architecture:

- **Require admin approval** for new members — anyone invited or using the link waits until an admin lets them in. Essential for small and medium groups where you want to know everyone present.
- **Announcement-only mode** — only admins can post; everyone else reads. Useful for large or semi-public groups where you want to broadcast information without open discussion.
- **Periodic member list audits** — check who's in the group regularly. For small to medium chats, verify you know everyone. For large chats, treat the space as semi-public and adjust what gets shared accordingly.

### Vetting new members

Not every group needs formal vetting. But when trust matters:

- **In person** is simplest — exchange Signal usernames face-to-face
- **Multi-member vouching** — require that two or more existing members confirm a new person before admitting them
- **Explain the space** — before or right after joining, tell new members what the group is for and what the norms are

The goal isn't gatekeeping. It's making sure everyone understands the context they're entering.

## 5. Onboard intentionally

When someone joins a group, explain:

- what gets shared here
- what doesn't
- how decisions are communicated
- where to ask questions

Security culture is learned socially, not configured technically.

---

## 6. Reduce alert fatigue

When everything feels urgent, nothing is.

Avoid:

- forwarding rumors
- constant notifications
- off-topic chatter
- panic-driven messages

Clear, relevant information helps groups make better decisions.

---

## 7. Treat communication as care

Before sharing, pause:

- Who needs this?
- Is this the right channel?
- Would a smaller conversation be better?

These small choices protect others from carrying information they don't need to carry.

*Healthy communication isn't about secrecy. It's about respect for the people in the conversation.*
