# Surveillance Capitalism

## Core Definition

Surveillance capitalism is an economic system centered on the commodification of personal data for the purpose of revenue generation through behavioral modification and prediction. Coined by Harvard Business School professor Shoshana Zuboff, the term describes how technology companies extract value from human experience by converting private behavioral data into behavioral data products that predict and influence future behavior.

Unlike traditional capitalism that focused on manufacturing and selling products to consumers, surveillance capitalism treats human experience as a free source of raw material for data extraction. This system creates unprecedented asymmetries of power and knowledge, where technology companies accumulate intimate knowledge about individuals and populations while users remain largely unaware of the scope and implications of this data collection.

## Historical Evolution and Context

### From Information Capitalism to Surveillance Capitalism
