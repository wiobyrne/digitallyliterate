## Definition
The Flow Map is Dr. Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's framework for understanding where flow states occur based on the relationship between challenge level and skill level.

## Key Insights 
# Flow Map
The [[02 DEVELOP/üåø Plants/Flow Map\|Flow Map]] is Dr. Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's way to describe where [[02 DEVELOP/üåø Plants/Flow\|Flow]] takes place in regards to the variables: Challenge and Skill. However he came about plotting the two variables against each, it's a landmark discovery. It's a lodestar to which I keep returning. It's the foundation much of my thinking and to my carving of that theory to practical, moment-to-moment application.

Later on, Dr. Mihaly used this version to show the different states of mind plotted on the map of Challenge vs Skill.

### What is my Contribution to Flow Theory?

My contribution to Flow Theory is just to expand on using the Flow Map as a practical tool to adjust one‚Äôs state of mind as needed‚Äîusually to create the [[02 DEVELOP/üåø Plants/Conditions of Flow\|Conditions of Flow]] ([[FlowCreation Theory\|FlowCreation Theory]]).

Basically, Mihaly‚Äôs Flow Map can be used many times a day as a simple tool to identify one‚Äôs current state of mind. That‚Äôs the easy part.

The second part is all about how to take that knowledge to improve one‚Äôs state of mind‚Äîideally by getting closer to a feeling of a high quality experience‚Äîwhat Mihaly calls ‚Äúoptimal experience,‚Äù which is none other than Flow.

So you can use the Flow Map as a "State of Mind" Map‚Äîa useful guide to manage your state of mind from moment to moment.

1. Find your current state of mind‚ÄîMaybe ask, "What am I feeling?" or "Where's my head at?"
2. Create the [[02 DEVELOP/üåø Plants/Conditions of Flow\|Conditions of Flow]]‚ÄîThis is where we can develop some [[FlowCreation Theory\|FlowCreation Theory]] skills and tactics. 

Say, someone is anxious: they can point to "Anxiety" on the Flow Map and then have a few ideas how to get closer to "Optimal Experience" (Flow). See below:

The obvious answer for creating the [[02 DEVELOP/üåø Plants/Conditions of Flow\|Conditions of Flow]] is to reduce the level of Challenge or to increase the level of Skill (as the map above shows).

The less obvious answer is *HOW*. That's about developing some awareness and skills, along with having some tools and tactics handy. See more about that at [[FlowCreation Theory\|FlowCreation Theory]].
