# Disappearing Messages as a Care Practice

Disappearing messages are often misunderstood as a way to hide information.

In practice, they are better understood as a way to **limit what people are asked to carry**.

This note explains why disappearing messages exist and when they help.

---

## Why messages don't need to last forever

Most conversations are temporary:
- coordination
- questions
- planning
- emotional processing

Archiving everything by default turns normal conversation into permanent recordkeeping — often without consent.

Letting messages disappear restores a more human rhythm to communication.

---

## Disappearing messages are not about secrecy

Using disappearing messages does **not** mean:
- something inappropriate is happening
- trust is lacking
- accountability is avoided

More often, it means:
- fewer screenshots floating elsewhere
- less accidental exposure
- lower cognitive and emotional load

---

## When disappearing messages help most

They are especially useful for:
- group coordination
- logistics
- sensitive but ordinary conversations
- temporary teams or events

They are less appropriate for:
- decisions that require long-term reference
- documentation or policy
- shared records that people agree to keep

---

## Setting expectations matters more than settings

Before enabling disappearing messages in a group, say why:

> We're using disappearing messages here to keep this conversation lightweight and reduce clutter.

Norms prevent confusion better than features.

---

## A literacy frame

Disappearing messages are a reminder that:
- not all information needs permanence
- consent includes how long information exists
- good communication considers downstream effects

This is digital literacy applied to care.
