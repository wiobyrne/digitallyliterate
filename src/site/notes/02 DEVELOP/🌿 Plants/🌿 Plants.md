# Plant Notes

Plants are ideas in active development. They've grown past the seed stage — there's enough here to see where the thinking is headed, but they're still being shaped.

Plants usually have:

- An emerging argument or framework
- Connections to other notes in the garden
- Sections that need expanding or questioning
- Rough edges that haven't been smoothed yet

## How plants grow

Plants develop through connection. As I read, write, and link ideas together, patterns emerge. A plant might combine insights from several seeds, draw on book notes, or respond to newsletter themes.

When a plant feels sturdy enough to stand on its own, it becomes an evergreen.
