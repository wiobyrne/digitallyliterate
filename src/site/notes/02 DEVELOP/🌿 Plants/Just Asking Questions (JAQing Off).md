# Just Asking Questions (JAQing Off)

## Summary

“Just Asking Questions” (often abbreviated as **JAQing off**) is a rhetorical tactic used to promote dubious or conspiratorial ideas without directly asserting them. By framing wild claims as innocuous questions, the speaker shifts the **burden of proof** to others, evades accountability, and subtly seeds doubt in the minds of the audience.

This strategy is often used to imply something is suspicious without taking responsibility for a claim, relying on **leading questions**, **Gish Gallops**, and **argumentum ad nauseam**.

## Key Characteristics

- **Shifts burden of proof**: Forces others to disprove insinuations.
    
- **Avoids clear claims**: Prevents being refuted or held accountable.
    
- **Ignores answers**: Repeats questions despite clear rebuttals.
    
- **Hides a position**: Appears neutral while promoting a particular viewpoint.
    
- **Often paired with**:
    
    - [Leading questions](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Leading_question)
        
    - [Loaded questions](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Loaded_question)
        
    - Sealioning

## Strategy

- Employed like a rhetorical push poll — appearing inquisitive but steering interpretation.
    
- Often used in conspiracy discourse (e.g., 9/11 truthers, anti-vaxxers).
    
- Enables individuals to sound reasonable while promoting irrational or disproven ideas.
    
- Common in disinfo campaigns and online debates where plausible deniability is key.

## Caveats & Nuance

- Not all question-based arguments are JAQing off:
    
    - Legitimate use: [Socratic method](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Socratic_method) for fostering critical thinking.
        
    - Questions posed in good faith or used to invite discussion are valid, especially when backed by sources or clear reasoning.
        
- JAQing off becomes problematic when questions:
    
    - Rehash points refuted many times ([PRATTs](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/PRATT)),
        
    - Ignore existing evidence,
        
    - Or are used to derail discussion.
