# Argumentum ad Nauseam

**Summary:**  
**Argumentum ad nauseam** is an informal logical fallacy where a claim is repeated so often that it begins to be accepted as truth, not because it has been substantiated, but due to the _frequency_ of its assertion. It is a subset of **argument by assertion**, and often overlaps with **argumentum ad populum** (appeal to popularity) and **petitio principii** (begging the question). The fallacy leverages repetition to simulate credibility.

---

**Core Idea:**

> Repetition ≠ Truth  
> The idea that repeating a claim often enough will make people believe it, even without evidence, is the essence of this fallacy.

---

**Common Forms:**

- **Political Talking Points:** Condensed into soundbites and repeated across media platforms to shape public opinion (e.g., "Tax cuts create jobs").
    
- **Memes or Viral Phrases:** Spread on blogs, social media (Twitter/X, Facebook), and video platforms where brevity and repetition fuel engagement.
    
- **Debate Strategy:** Repeating a disproven claim to wear down opposition or shift Overton windows.
    
- **"Point Refuted a Thousand Times" (PRATT):** When the same debunked argument resurfaces regardless of evidence (common in pseudoscience or conspiracy theory circles).

**Illustrative Example:**

> "There is no proof that atheism is accurate and correct. There is no proof..." (repeated endlessly as seen in religious apologetics and internet debates).

---

**Caveats & Clarifications:**

- Not all repetition is fallacious.  
    → **Instructional repetition** (teachers, parents, drill sergeants) or **scientific reinforcement** (e.g., confirming laws of chemistry) are not fallacies.
    
- **Repetition + Argument** ≠ Fallacy. The issue arises when repetition replaces or obscures the need for valid reasoning and evidence.

**Why It Matters (Digital Context):**  
The **attention economy** and **algorithmic amplification** make this fallacy particularly dangerous in networked environments. On platforms where visibility and repetition drive perceived authority, **argumentum ad nauseam** can reinforce disinformation, prejudice, or undermine public discourse.

**Further Reflection:**

- How can educators and digital citizens build resilience against this fallacy in an age of viral misinformation?
    
- How might repetition _appear_ as consensus or evidence in AI-generated or aggregated content?
