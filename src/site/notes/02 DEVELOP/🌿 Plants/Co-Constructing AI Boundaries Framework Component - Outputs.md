# Co-Constructing AI Boundaries Framework Component - Outputs

## Definition in This Study

**Outputs** refers to what the AI model generated in response to student prompts, and crucially, **how students evaluated and responded to** those outputs. This component captures both the AI's production and the student's critical assessment.

---

## Mollick & Mollick (2023) Connection

The Outputs component corresponds to M&M's emphasis on:
- **Vigilance and critical assessment** of AI responses
- **Risks of confabulation** (hallucination) and bias
- The necessity for **human oversight**
- Avoiding **complacency about AI output**

**Key M&M Principle:** "Students must remain the human in the loop."

M&M repeatedly emphasize that students cannot passively accept AI outputs—they must actively assess quality, accuracy, and bias.

---

## What This Component Analyzes

### Primary Focus
- **Output quality:** Accuracy, coherence, depth, relevance
- **Student evaluation:** Evidence of critical assessment
- **Recognition of problems:** Hallucinations, bias, logical errors
- **Decision point:** Does output quality trigger intervention?

### Secondary Focus
- Sophistication of evaluation criteria
- Explicit articulation of quality judgments
- Awareness of AI limitations

---

## Agency in Outputs: The Evaluation Decision

This component captures **[[03 CREATE/🌲 Evergreens/Agency\|Agency]] over Output Evaluation:**

| Evidence of High Agency | Evidence of Low Agency |
|-------------------------|------------------------|
| Critical assessment of quality | Uncritical acceptance |
| Identifies hallucinations/errors | Misses obvious problems |
| Recognizes bias or limitations | Treats output as neutral/objective |
| Verifies claims against sources | No fact-checking |
| Articulates evaluation criteria | No explicit judgment |

---

## Types of Output Problems Students Should Recognize

### 1. Hallucinations (Confabulation)
- AI invents citations that don't exist
- AI "quotes" sources inaccurately
- AI creates plausible-sounding but false information

### 2. Bias
- Reinforces stereotypes or dominant narratives
- Omits marginalized perspectives
- Uses problematic framing or language

### 3. Logical Errors
- Faulty reasoning or argumentation
- Contradictions within output
- Unsupported claims

### 4. Superficiality
- Surface-level analysis lacking depth
- Generic responses without nuance
- Missing critical perspectives

### 5. Misalignment
- Output doesn't address the prompt
- Misunderstands the task or context
- Irrelevant or off-topic content

---

## Boundary-work in Outputs

Outputs serve as a **boundary trigger:**
- **Poor output quality** forces students to intervene
- Recognition of problems signals need for human correction
- Assessment of output quality determines next moves

Students engaging in [[03 CREATE/🌲 Evergreens/Boundary-work\|Boundary-work]] will:
- **Reject** problematic outputs
- **Flag** errors for correction
- **Verify** claims against sources
- **Recognize** when AI has reached its limits

---

## Key Analytic Questions

When coding Outputs, ask:

1. **Quality:**
   - Is the output accurate, coherent, relevant?
   - Does it contain hallucinations or errors?
   - Is it superficial or substantive?

2. **Student Evaluation:**
   - Does the student assess the output critically?
   - Do they recognize problems?
   - Do they verify claims?

3. **Response to Quality:**
   - Does poor output trigger intervention?
   - Does student revise prompts or reject output?
   - Do they continue despite problems?

4. **Epistemic Stance:**
   - Does student treat output as authoritative?
   - Do they position themselves as evaluator?

---

## Examples from Data

### High Agency Response to Output
```
AI Output: "Research shows that direct instruction is the
most effective approach for literacy instruction."

Student Evaluation: "This is problematic. The AI is
presenting one perspective as universal fact. It ignores
critical literacy approaches and culturally sustaining
pedagogy. I need to prompt it to consider multiple
perspectives, specifically from scholars of color."

[Student revises prompt]
```
**Analysis:**
- Recognizes bias (dominant narrative)
- Identifies omission (critical perspectives)
- Takes corrective action
- Positions self as evaluator

### Low Agency Response to Output
```
AI Output: [Contains hallucinated citation]

Student: [Copies output verbatim into final project without
verification]
```
**Analysis:**
- No critical evaluation
- No verification
- Uncritical acceptance
- AI positioned as authority

---

## Connection to [[03 CREATE/🌲 Evergreens/Epistemic Stance\|Epistemic Stance]]

Output evaluation reveals epistemic stance:
- **AI-authoritative stance:** Accepts outputs without verification
- **Self-authoritative stance:** Critically evaluates, positions self as judge
- **Co-constructed stance:** Treats outputs as collaborative drafts requiring human refinement

---

## Coding Categories for Outputs

### Output Quality Codes
| Code | Definition | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| **Accurate** | Factually correct | Correct citation format |
| **Hallucination** | Invented information | Fake citation |
| **Biased** | Reinforces problematic narratives | Deficit framing |
| **Superficial** | Lacks depth or nuance | Generic summary |
| **Substantive** | Deep, nuanced analysis | Critical synthesis |

### Student Response Codes
| Code | Definition | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| **Critical Evaluation** | Explicit assessment | "This misses the critical perspective" |
| **Verification** | Fact-checking | Cross-references against sources |
| **Recognition of Error** | Identifies problems | "This citation is fake" |
| **Uncritical Acceptance** | No evaluation | Copies without assessment |
| **Corrective Action** | Revises prompt or rejects | Re-prompts for better output |

## Relationship to Other Framework Components

- **← [[02 DEVELOP/🌿 Plants/Co-Constructing AI Boundaries Framework Component - Prompts\|Co-Constructing AI Boundaries Framework Component - Prompts]]:** Prompt quality influences output quality
- **→ [[Co-Constructing AI Boundaries Framework Component - Integration\|Co-Constructing AI Boundaries Framework Component - Integration]]:** Output evaluation determines integration approach
- **→ [[Co-Constructing AI Boundaries Framework Component - Reflection\|Co-Constructing AI Boundaries Framework Component - Reflection]]:** Students may reflect on output problems

---

## Pedagogical Implications

**Teaching critical output evaluation:**
1. Discuss common AI failure modes (hallucination, bias, etc.)
2. Practice fact-checking and verification
3. Model critical evaluation of AI outputs
4. Teach students to recognize bias and omissions
5. Encourage healthy skepticism
6. Provide rubrics for output quality assessment

## The "Human in the Loop" Principle

M&M's central requirement is that **students must remain the human in the loop:**

> "Students should actively oversee the AI's output, check with reliable sources, and complement any AI output with their unique perspectives and insights."

The Outputs component operationalizes this principle by analyzing:
- **Do students oversee?** (Critical evaluation)
- **Do they check?** (Verification)
- **Do they complement?** (Add human perspective)

---

## Data Collection Notes

**Where to find evidence:**
- NotebookLM chat logs (what AI produced)
- Student responses to outputs (in chat or reflections)
- Verification behaviors (cross-checking sources)
- Explicit evaluative comments
- Evidence of prompt revision after poor output
- Final projects (did they catch errors?)
