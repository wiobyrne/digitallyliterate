# Critical Pedagogy Framework

## Core Philosophy
Education as **tool for liberation and social transformation**. Critiques traditional schooling for reinforcing social inequalities and power imbalances.

**Pioneer:** Paulo Freire

## Key Objectives

### Critical Consciousness Development
- Awareness of societal oppression
- Questioning the world both inside and outside classroom
- **Analyze the world through a more critical lens**

### Power Differential Minimization
- Reduce teacher-student hierarchy
- Invite "dialogue among diverse and even clashing perspectives"
- **Student empowerment over teacher indoctrination**

### Challenge Dominant Narratives
- Question "unquestioned norms" and "hegemonic stratification"
- Expose the "hidden curriculum"
- **Democratic process where beliefs are "brought into question for open and rational discussion"**

## Rejection of "Banking Concept"
**Traditional Model (Rejected):**
- Teacher "deposits" information into students' minds
- Passive reception of knowledge
- Reinforces authority structures

**Critical Model (Embraced):**
- Teacher as co-investigator
- Students as active participants in learning
- Knowledge constructed through dialogue

## Application to Devil's Advocate Method

### Why Teacher's Personal Views Are Suppressed
- Goal is to **empower student, not indoctrinate**
- Teacher transcends personal bias for higher pedagogical purpose
- Focus shifts from teacher authority to **validity of ideas themselves**

### Democratic Process Modeling
- Demonstrates rational discussion in action
- Shows how beliefs can be questioned openly
- **Students learn to challenge assumptions** rather than accept authority

## Practical Implications
- Create space for diverse perspectives
- Challenge students to question status quo
- Focus on idea validity over teacher opinion
- Promote social justice through critical inquiry

## Connection to My Teaching Philosophy
This framework directly supports my emphasis in [[04 META/ðŸ‘¤ About Me/Teaching Philosophy\|Teaching Philosophy]] on "amplifying marginalized voices," "questioning power structures," and "developing critical perspectives on educational equity and justice."

## Critical Examination
My analysis in [[02 DEVELOP/ðŸŒ¿ Plants/Critical Pedagogy Blinds When Progressive Education Perpetuates Harm\|Critical Pedagogy Blinds When Progressive Education Perpetuates Harm]] reveals how this framework can be misused to avoid accountability. The key is ensuring the framework serves students rather than protecting institutional/teacher interests.
