# Digital Identity

## **Definition**  
Digital identity refers to the information that uniquely identifies an individual or entity in the digital realm, often including personal data, online activities, and credentials.

## **Explain Like I'm 5**  
Think of digital identity like your online passport that shows who you are on the internet. Just like your real passport has your name and picture, your digital identity includes things like your email address, social media profiles, and online shopping accounts.
