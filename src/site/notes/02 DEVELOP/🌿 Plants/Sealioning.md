# Sealioning

## Summary

**Sealioning** is a rhetorical and social tactic in which a person persistently asks seemingly polite, reasonable questions—often in bad faith or with derailing intent. Though superficially civil, the approach overwhelms or frustrates others by repeatedly demanding explanations of basic or previously settled premises (e.g., “Can you prove sexism exists?”).

This behavior:

- Disrupts ongoing conversations by forcing a return to entry-level debates.
    
- Shifts the emotional labor of explanation entirely onto others.
    
- Gives the sealion a victim posture when met with irritation or dismissal.

## Key Characteristics

- **Feigns civility**: The sealion often insists they’re “just being curious” or “asking questions,” mirroring [[02 DEVELOP/🌿 Plants/Just Asking Questions (JAQing Off)\|Just Asking Questions (JAQing Off)]].
    
- **Interrupts context**: Often enters conversations midstream, lacking shared assumptions or history.
    
- **Derails discourse**: The conversation shifts from nuanced dialogue to rehashing foundational debates.
    
- **Employs plausible deniability**: Makes it difficult to call out without seeming hostile or unfair.
    
- **Leads to exhaustion**: The cumulative effect can be silencing, especially in activist or marginalized communities.

## Platform Contexts

- **Especially common on Twitter/X** and other public or semi-public forums, where:
    
    - Conversations lack continuity or participant boundaries.
        
    - Bad actors exploit openness and visibility to intervene.
        
    - Norms of mutual understanding are compressed or absent.
        
- Sealioning is **not always malicious**—but its impact (not intent) defines it. Even **earnest newcomers** can inadvertently sealion by demanding foundational explanations during high-context discussions.
