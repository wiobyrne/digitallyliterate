# AI Workshop Framework for Educators

*AI for Thoughtful Teaching & Learning*

> A hands-on, reflective workshop to help K–8 educators explore AI in meaningful, critical, and creative ways.

---

## Workshop Overview

This framework is designed for K-8 educators to:
- Engage with generative AI tools critically
- Design classroom-ready units
- Gain practical strategies and deeper insights into what AI *is* and what it *means* for education

---

## Strand 1: Understanding AI & Machine Learning

**Core Question:** What is AI, really—and what should educators know about how it works?

### Topics Covered

- What AI and machine learning *are* (and what they aren't)
- How tools like ChatGPT and NotebookLM work behind the scenes
- The human, environmental, and ethical costs of AI
  - Data privacy
  - Bias
  - Surveillance
- Moving beyond hype and fear toward responsible use

### Hands-On Activities

- Experiment with AI tools and compare outputs
- Learn how systems process language and identify patterns
- Explore classroom strategies to discuss AI critically

### Outcomes

By the end of this strand, participants will:
- Use AI tools with confidence and curiosity
- Ask hard questions about AI's impact
- Help students develop critical digital literacy around AI

---

## Strand 2: Designing AI-Enhanced Learning Around Wicked Problems

**Core Question:** How can AI support deeper thinking, inquiry, and ethical reflection?

### The Approach

Design a unit centered on a **wicked problem** — a complex, real-world issue that matters in your community or classroom.

**Framework:** Project-Based Learning (PBL) with:
- Computational thinking practices
- STEAM ethics lens

### How AI Tools Support This

Tools like NotebookLM and ChatGPT help students:
- Organize and synthesize research
- Ask deeper, more thoughtful questions
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Reflect on ethical implications of innovation

### Outcomes

Participants leave with:
- A fully developed, classroom-ready unit
- Strategies for scaffolding inquiry for students
- A toolkit of AI tools and resources
- Feedback from fellow educators

---

## Strand 3: AI as Cognitive Amplifier and Teaching Assistant

**Core Question:** How can AI tools work *with* you—not *for* you—to support your practice?

### Focus Areas

| Tool | Application |
|------|-------------|
| **NotebookLM** | Organize content, generate insights, build knowledge models |
| **Google AI Studio** | Design custom prompts tailored to your needs |
| **Custom AI Tools** | Create using your own curriculum and resources |

### Practical Applications

- Lesson planning and differentiation
- Feedback generation
- Research support
- Unit development

### Outcomes

Participants leave with:
- Custom tools ready for classroom use
- Personalized workflows to save time
- AI as a partner in your professional practice

---

## Key Principles

Throughout all strands:

1. **AI as amplifier, not replacement** — Your professional judgment stays central
2. **Critical engagement** — Question the tools, don't just use them
3. **Ethical awareness** — Consider costs, biases, and implications
4. **Practical application** — Leave with usable resources

---

## Workshop Deliverables

By the end of the workshop, participants will have:

- [ ] A classroom-ready unit on a wicked problem
- [ ] Custom AI prompts and tools
- [ ] Strategies for teaching AI literacy to students
- [ ] A personal workflow for AI-assisted planning
