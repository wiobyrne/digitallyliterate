# Parameter


## **Definition**  
A parameter is a variable that is used in a mathematical model or function to represent specific characteristics or properties of the system being studied.

## **Explain Like I'm 5**  
Think of parameters as ingredients in a recipe. Just like how you need different ingredients to make a cake taste different, parameters are like the special ingredients that make each math problem unique.

## **Digging Deeper**
In mathematical models or functions, parameters are values that can be adjusted to change the behavior or output of the system. For example, in a linear equation, the slope and intercept are parameters that determine the shape of the line. In machine learning algorithms, parameters are used to fine-tune the model and improve its performance.

## **Applications**  
- In physics, parameters are used to describe physical properties such as mass, velocity, and acceleration.
- In economics, parameters are used to represent factors like demand, supply, and price elasticity.
- In biology, parameters can represent characteristics of organisms such as growth rates or population size.
- In engineering, parameters are crucial for designing systems and optimizing performance.
- In computer science, parameters are used in programming languages to pass values to functions for processing.
