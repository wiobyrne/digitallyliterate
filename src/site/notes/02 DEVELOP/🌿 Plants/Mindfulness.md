## Overview
- Mindfulness is the practice of being present in the moment, fully engaged in whatever you are doing without becoming overwhelmed or overly reactive. It is a state of active, open attention on the present which allows us to observe our thoughts and feelings without judgement.

- **Notes:** *Mindfulness is often associated with meditation but it can also be practiced during everyday activities like eating or walking. It has roots in Buddhist traditions but has been adopted widely in Western psychology due to its benefits for stress reduction and overall mental health.*

## Development
- Mindfulness can be cultivated through various techniques such as meditation, body scan exercises and mindful breathing. Regular practice can lead to increased self-awareness and emotional intelligence. It can help reduce stress, improve focus and boost overall well-being.
- In the context of psychology, mindfulness-based therapies have been developed to treat conditions like depression and anxiety. For instance, Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) combines cognitive behavioral techniques with mindfulness strategies to help people better understand and manage their thoughts and emotions.
