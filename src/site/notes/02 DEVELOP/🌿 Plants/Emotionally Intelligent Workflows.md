# Emotionally Intelligent Workflows

Emotionally intelligent workflows recognize that all work—especially collaborative, intellectual, or creative work—is emotional as well as cognitive. These workflows are grounded in an **epistemological stance** that values knowledge as relational, constructed, and contextually situated. They assume that _how_ we come to know is just as important as _what_ we come to know.

#### Core Commitments:

- **Epistemological humility**: I believe knowledge emerges from dialogue, not domination. I do not assume mastery over all domains, and I welcome perspectives that challenge or expand my own.
    
- **Boundaried compassion**: I aim to show up with empathy and care, while also naming limits—what I will and will not do emotionally, energetically, or ethically. This creates mutual respect and psychological safety.
    
- **Process over perfection**: The work is expected to be messy, recursive, nonlinear. Mistakes are not failures but part of the rhythm of authentic learning and co-creation.
    
- **Challenge ≠ harm**: Emotional intelligence does not mean avoiding hard conversations—it means handling them with care. We push one another intellectually, but never to shame, dominate, or silence.
    
- **Consent, not compliance**: Participation is not assumed. Power is shared where possible, and people are given agency to opt in, opt out, or renegotiate roles and expectations.
    
- **Generous interpretation**: When in doubt, assume good intentions. Extend grace. But also create space to clarify, recalibrate, and name harm when needed.
    

#### Ethos of the Space:

- **Inclusive, not performative**: We do not tokenize or extract from others' lived experiences. We build with, not for or about.
    
- **Emotionally honest, not emotionally manipulative**: Feelings are welcome, but not weaponized. We resist passive-aggressive dynamics, gaslighting, or self-silencing.
    
- **Sustainable, not extractive**: We check in, check out, take breaks, and respect bandwidth. The pace of the group is not set by urgency or overwork.
