## Key Questions for Your Journey

1. **Usability First:** How do we choose tools that protect privacy AND are easy for everyone?

2. **Community Capacity:** What level of technical responsibility can we realistically share?

3. **Fair Funding:** How do we pay for privacy tools in ways that don't exclude anyone?

4. **Learning Together:** How can switching tools become powerful digital literacy education?

5. **Mutual Support:** How do we make sure no one gets left behind when we change platforms?

## What Makes This Work
