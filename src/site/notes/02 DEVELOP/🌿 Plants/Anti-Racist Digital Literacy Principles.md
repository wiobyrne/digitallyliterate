# Anti-Racist Digital Literacy Principles

*A framework for curriculum development and assessment*

> An effective set of principles for anti-racist digital literacy education fosters critical thinking, inclusivity, and the proactive dismantling of systemic racism in digital spaces.

---

## The Nine Principles

These principles emerged from a synthesis of literature on digital literacy, anti-racist education, and current research trends. They serve as a starting point for curriculum development and assessing curricular alignment.

### 1. Critical Analysis of Media and Information

Teach learners to critically evaluate digital content, identify biases, and analyze sources to understand the impact on marginalized communities.

*Who creates content? For what purpose? How does it affect different communities?*

### 2. Inclusivity and Representation

Highlight diverse voices and experiences in digital content. Encourage learners to seek out and amplify stories from underrepresented groups to challenge dominant narratives.

### 3. Challenging Racism and Discrimination

Educate learners about racism and discrimination in digital spaces. Equip them with tools to:
- Recognize microaggressions
- Confront racist behaviors
- Understand power dynamics

### 4. Building Digital Empathy and Solidarity

Guide learners to develop empathy and solidarity by:
- Connecting with others who share their experiences
- Supporting anti-racist causes
- Participating in collaborative projects promoting allyship

### 5. Promoting Equity and Social Justice

Integrate social justice into digital literacy education through:
- Advocating for change
- Supporting social justice movements
- Engaging in civic action

### 6. Digital Safety and Well-Being

Teach online safety to protect learners from cyberbullying and harassment. Create supportive environments where learners can engage in anti-racist education without fear of retaliation or harm.

### 7. Continuous Learning and Adaptation

Foster lifelong learning and adaptation to evolving technologies and social contexts. Encourage learners to stay informed on digital developments affecting racial equity.

### 8. Addressing Mental Health and Socio-emotional Learning

Acknowledge the emotional and mental burdens of advocating for systemic change. Emphasize the importance of self-care and support — for both learners and educators.

### 9. Self-Care for Educators

Support educators in maintaining resilience through:
- Practicing self-compassion
- Setting boundaries
- Seeking professional or peer support

Mental well-being enhances the ability to engage in anti-racist work effectively.
