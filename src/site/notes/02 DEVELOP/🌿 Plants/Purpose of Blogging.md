# Purpose of Blogging
## Building Identity, Network, and Voice in Digital Communities

## The Authentic Purpose: Beyond the Glossy Headshot

### Blogging as Networked Tool
> "Most folks treat their blog as if it were some kind of glossy headshot of their thinking, whereas the beauty and freedom of blogging was that it was by design a networked tool."

**True Purpose of Blogging**:
- **Developing an online voice** through authentic, ongoing writing practice
- **Connecting with particular networks** of like-minded individuals and communities
- **Building identity online** in conjunction with others working through similar processes
- **Creating authentic relationships** rather than performative self-presentation

## The Scale Distraction Problem

### When Scale Becomes the Enemy of Connection
> "Scale in many ways became a distraction, one which was magnified to such a degree by the hype around MOOCs in edtech that anything less than 10s of thousands of 'users,' 'learners,' 'participants,' followers,' etc. was tacitly considered somehow less than optimal for effective online learning."

**The Scale Obsession**:
- **Massive numbers** prioritized over meaningful connections
- **MOOC mentality** infecting smaller, more intimate learning spaces
- **Quantity metrics** overshadowing quality relationships
- **Platform validation** through follower counts rather than engagement depth

**Problems with Scale-First Thinking**:
- Loss of authentic voice in pursuit of broad appeal
- Superficial engagement replacing deep conversation
- Performance anxiety overwhelming genuine expression
- Community intimacy sacrificed for audience growth

### The Value of Smaller, Engaged Communities
**Quality Over Quantity Benefits**:
- **Deeper relationships** with regular readers and commenters
- **More meaningful feedback** and genuine conversation
- **Authentic voice development** without broad audience pressure
- **Sustainable engagement** that supports long-term growth

**The Lurker Question**:
> "What about the lurkers?"

Recognition that engaged readership includes:
- **Silent participants** who read regularly but don't comment
- **Occasional contributors** who engage periodically
- **Cross-platform connections** who respond elsewhere
- **Long-term followers** who develop relationship over time

## Blogging as Voice and Identity Development

### Online Voice Creation
