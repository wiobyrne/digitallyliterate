# Participatory Action Research in Education

*Research with, not on, educators and communities*

> Participatory Action Research (PAR) positions participants as co-researchers, not just subjects — ensuring that research leads to meaningful, actionable change.

---

## What is PAR?

Participatory Action Research combines:
- **Participation** — Those affected by the research are involved in designing and conducting it
- **Action** — The goal is not just knowledge, but change
- **Research** — Systematic inquiry that generates trustworthy findings

PAR aligns with principles of educational justice by centering the voices of practitioners.

## Core Principles

| Principle | In Practice |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Co-design** | Involve teachers and administrators in shaping research questions |
| **Feedback loops** | Share preliminary findings for validation |
| **Iterative cycles** | Plan → Act → Observe → Reflect → Repeat |
| **Power sharing** | Balance relationships between researchers and participants |
| **Actionable outcomes** | Research should lead to real change |

---

## Research Design Framework

### Phased Data Collection

**Phase 1: Initial Exploration**
- Baseline interviews and focus groups
- Understand motivations, perceptions, current state
- Establish trust and relationships

**Phase 2: During Implementation**
- Periodic check-ins and reflective journals
- Track progress on specific competencies
- Identify emerging barriers and accelerators

**Phase 3: Post-Implementation**
- Follow-up assessments and interviews
- Measure long-term impact
- Co-create recommendations for change

---

## Data Collection Methods

### Qualitative
- **Interviews** — Structured and semi-structured, individual
- **Focus Groups** — Group discussions on shared experiences
- **Reflective Journals** — Periodic written reflections
- **Observation** — Researcher notes during activities

### Quantitative
- **Pre-Post Assessments** — Measure changes in knowledge/attitudes
- **Growth Curve Assessments** — Track progress over time
- **Surveys** — Likert-scale items on confidence, relevance

### Mixed Methods
Combine both to capture rich, nuanced insights alongside measurable changes.

## Analysis Framework

| Focus Area | Questions to Explore |
|------------|---------------------|
| **Barriers** | What obstacles do participants face? |
| **Accelerators** | What factors support success? |
| **Support Mechanisms** | How do institutions help or hinder? |
| **Knowledge Growth** | How has understanding changed? |
| **Practice Change** | How has behavior changed? |

---

## Ethical Considerations

- **Informed Consent** — Participants understand purpose, role, and data privacy
- **Confidentiality** — Pseudonyms and anonymized data in reporting
- **Voluntary Participation** — Can withdraw at any time
- **Power Dynamics** — Foster authentic collaboration, not extraction
- **Feedback** — Share results with participants for validation

---

## Tools for Organization

| Purpose | Tools |
|---------|-------|
| **Project Management** | Trello, Asana |
| **Qualitative Analysis** | NVivo, MAXQDA |
| **Quantitative Analysis** | SPSS, R, Python |
| **Collaboration** | Google Drive, shared repositories |

## Why PAR for Educational Justice?

PAR aligns naturally with movements for educational equity:

- Centers practitioner knowledge and experience
- Challenges top-down research models
- Produces actionable, context-specific findings
- Builds community capacity alongside generating knowledge
- Respects participants as experts in their own contexts
