# Daily CBT-style Journaling Practice

## ðŸ§  Daily Self-Check Journal Prompts
*(5â€“10 minutes, once a dayâ€”morning or evening works best)*

This structured journaling practice helps identify thought patterns, separate facts from interpretations, and develop healthier responses to daily challenges.

### 1. **What happened?**
> What situation, conversation, or silence is bothering me today?

**Examples:**
- "She went to the gym and didn't text afterward."
- "She seemed quiet when she came home."
- "She didn't mention my birthday much after the cake."

**Your reflection:**
Write the triggering situation without interpretationâ€”just the observable event.

---

### 2. **What am I telling myself about it?**
> What assumptions, stories, or fears am I adding?

**Examples:**
- "She doesn't care."
- "She's pulling away and I don't know why."
- "Something is wrong and I'm the last to know."

**Your reflection:**
Notice the narrative your mind creates. Often these are worst-case scenarios or mind-reading.

---

### 3. **What do I *actually* know?** *(Facts only)*
> Step outside the story and write what is *real and observed.*

**Examples:**
- "She said she loves me."
- "She's going to therapy and trying."
- "She agreed check-ins work for her."

**Your reflection:**
Strip away assumptions and focus only on verifiable facts and evidence.

---

### 4. **What's the feeling underneath my story?**
> Often it's not angerâ€”it's fear, sadness, loneliness, or feeling unseen.

**Examples:**
- "I feel anxious and like I'm about to be left."
- "I feel unseen and uncelebrated."
- "I'm scared I'll never fully feel safe in love."

**Your reflection:**
Identify the core emotion driving your reactions. Look beyond surface anger to deeper fears.

---

### 5. **What would I say if I were being honest *and* kind?**
> Imagine saying it to herâ€”or just to yourself for now.

**Examples:**
- "I've been feeling a little distant and unsure. I think my mind's filling in blanks with fear, and I don't want to spiral."
- "I don't need everything to be perfect, but I do need to feel seen."
- "I love you, and I'm working on communicating better when I start to shut down."

**Your reflection:**
Practice vulnerable, non-accusatory communication that expresses needs without blame.

---

### 6. **What's one small action I can take today?**
> Gentle, forward movementâ€”not fix-it energy.

**Examples:**
- Text her a kind, honest message.
- Tell her: "I'm feeling a little off, but I don't want to assume anything. Just wanted to say I care."
- Write your worries, then close the journal and do something grounding: walk, stretch, music.

**Your reflection:**
Choose a small, concrete step that moves you toward connection rather than withdrawal.
