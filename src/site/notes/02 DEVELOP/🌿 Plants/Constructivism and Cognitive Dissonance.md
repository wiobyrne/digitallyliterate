# Constructivism and Cognitive Dissonance

## Core Principle
Learners are not passive recipients of information but **active builders of knowledge**. Learning occurs as students experience the world and reflect upon those experiences, incorporating new information into existing mental frameworks ("schemas").

## Key Mechanisms

### Cognitive Dissonance
- Mental unease when encountering information that contradicts current understanding
- **Catalyst for conceptual change and intellectual growth**
- Necessary disruption of existing beliefs for learning

### Schema Revision
- Students must "revise and redevelop existing schemas" when faced with conflicting information
- Learning requires restructuring one's worldview
- **Not always comfortable** - requires disruption of existing beliefs

## Pedagogical Implications

### Teacher's Role
- **Provoke cognitive dissonance** to force revision of schemas
- "Assign problems and activities that will challenge students"
- Create conditions where students must accommodate new information

### Student Experience
- **Psychological discomfort is expected** - sign of learning in progress
- Must actively engage with contradictory information
- Forced to "consider other explanations" rather than maintain status quo

## Connection to Devil's Advocate Method
The [[02 DEVELOP/ðŸŒ¿ Plants/Devil's Advocate Methodology\|Devil's Advocate Methodology]] is a **deliberate method for creating necessary cognitive dissonance**. Student discomfort/confusion is observable manifestation of cognitive dissonance - indicator that technique is achieving theoretical goal.

## Practical Applications
- Challenge student assumptions directly
- Present information that contradicts existing beliefs
- Create structured intellectual conflict
- Frame discomfort as normal part of learning process

## Links to My Teaching Practice
This theoretical foundation directly supports my approach in [[04 META/ðŸ‘¤ About Me/Teaching Philosophy\|Teaching Philosophy]] where I emphasize that learning involves "acquisition and construction of knowledge" through active engagement. The framework validates my use of questioning and challenging techniques.
