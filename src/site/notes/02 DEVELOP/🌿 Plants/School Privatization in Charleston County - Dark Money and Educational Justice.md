# School Privatization in Charleston County - Dark Money and Educational Justice

## Executive Summary

Charleston County School District, South Carolina's second-largest district with approximately 50,000 students, has become a critical battleground for school privatization efforts. This analysis examines the systematic campaign led by the Charleston Coalition for Kids, a dark-money organization that has successfully influenced school board composition and policy direction since 2018, and the community resistance that has emerged in response.

## Historical Context

### South Carolina's Educational Landscape
South Carolina's schools have long been among the worst-performing in the country, "saddled with a legacy of apathy and low expectations" that leave students "unprepared for the world that awaits them," according to extensive investigative reporting. This educational crisis has provided fertile ground for privatization advocates who frame market-based solutions as necessary reforms.

### Charleston's Unique Position
Charleston County represents a particularly stark example of educational inequality, characterized by:
- Deep racial and economic segregation
- A tourist-dependent economy creating dramatic wealth disparities
- Geographic distribution across urban, suburban, and rural communities with vastly different resources
- School choice programs that have "siphoned the best-performing students from struggling schools while children with the fewest resources get marooned in failing institutions"

## The Charleston Coalition for Kids

### Organizational Structure and Funding
The Charleston Coalition for Kids emerged in 2018 as a 501(c)(4) organization, allowing it to engage in political activity while keeping donor identities secret. Key characteristics include:

#### Leadership and Backing
- **Founding Members**: Billionaires Anita Zucker (CEO of InterTech Group) and Ben Navarro (Sherman Financial Group founder)
- **Public Support**: Former Charleston Mayor Joe Riley
- **Political Influence**: 6 of the 9 sitting Charleston County School Board members have received backing from the Coalition

#### Financial Resources
The Coalition's spending patterns reveal significant financial resources:
- **2018 Election**: At least $235,000 on TV commercials alone in the run-up to the 2018 school board election â€“ four-and-a-half times what all of the candidates combined raised for their own campaigns
- **2020 Election**: $306,000 on TV commercials, including attack ads against two Black incumbents
- **Additional Spending**: Local activists estimate hundreds of thousands of additional dollars on Facebook ads, billboards, and other media

### Electoral Success and Declining Influence
The Coalition's electoral track record demonstrates both initial success and subsequent decline:
- **2018**: 100% success rate (All four candidates endorsed by the coalition during the last election won)
- **2020**: 40% success rate (just two of its five candidates were elected)
- **2022**: 22% success rate, representing a "meteoric drop of the coalition's political influence"

### Policy Agenda
The Coalition promotes several educational initiatives: It wants to close the achievement gap that dogs Charleston County schools. In order to do that, it supports early childhood education, more autonomy for principals, better pay for teachers, increased transparency and accountability in the schools

## The Reimagine Schools Proposal

### Proposal Overview
In 2022, the Coastal Community Foundation (CCF) presented the "Reimagine Schools" proposal, targeting 23 low-performing schools in low-income and majority-Black parts of the county with a $32 million investment from federal COVID-19 relief funds.

### Key Components
The proposal included:
- Creation of "Innovation Commissions" - community groups tasked with determining what is causing low performance in about two dozen schools
- Public-private partnerships similar to Meeting Street Schools model
- Potential for external management of public schools

### Community and Professional Response
The proposal faced significant opposition:
- **Teacher Educators**: The College of Charleston's education department published a formal letter opposing the plan
- **Community Advocates**: Parent and community groups raised concerns about privatization without community input
- **Professional Educators**: Questions about whether external management could improve outcomes better than existing public school structures

## Critical Analysis Framework

### Neoliberal Education Reform
The Charleston situation exemplifies broader neoliberal approaches to education policy:

#### Market-Based Solutions
- Application of business principles to educational governance
- Emphasis on competition and choice as improvement mechanisms
- Transfer of "as much power as possible to the private sector" through public-private partnerships

#### Deregulation and Privatization
- Support for charter schools and school choice expansion
- Advocacy for reduced "bureaucratic" oversight
- Push for performance-based accountability systems

### Democratic Governance Concerns

#### Dark Money and Transparency
The Coalition's funding structure raises significant democratic concerns:
- Critics demanding "the same sort of transparency from the Coalition for Kids that the coalition rightly wants from the school district"
- Hidden donor identities despite massive electoral spending
- Potential conflicts of interest between funders and proposed policies

#### Community Voice and Participation
Too often missing from these discussions are the voices or perspectives from individuals from within the actual communities who will be directly impacted or affected by policies to improve their neighborhood public schools

Key democratic deficits include:
- Limited community input in policy development
- Proposals developed by external organizations rather than community stakeholders
- Concerns that CCF and its allies are moving forward with a vision that is open to privatization and financial profits for vendors without receiving input from the community

### Racial and Economic Justice Implications

#### Targeting of Vulnerable Communities
The privatization efforts disproportionately target:
- Schools serving majority-Black student populations
- High-poverty communities
- Rural and isolated areas with limited political power

#### Perpetuation of Segregation
School choice programs have created a system where "North Charleston High loses more than half the students in its attendance zone to a host of magnet, charter and private schools, leaving behind a core of poor Black students"

## Teacher Educator Perspective

### Professional Responsibility
As teacher educators working within this contested environment, several ethical considerations emerge:

#### Institutional Neutrality vs. Professional Advocacy
- Balancing academic objectivity with professional responsibility to advocate for public education
- Determining appropriate levels of engagement in local political controversies
- Maintaining credibility while taking principled stands on educational policy

#### Preparation of Future Educators
- Ensuring teacher candidates understand the political context of education
- Developing critical literacy around education policy and reform movements
- Preparing educators to work effectively within contested policy environments

### Research and Evidence-Based Practice
The Charleston situation highlights the importance of:
- Rigorous evaluation of privatization claims and outcomes
- Independent research on educational effectiveness
- Community-based participatory research that centers affected voices

## Community Resistance and Organization

### Grassroots Opposition
Significant community resistance has emerged:
- **Quality Education Project**: Leading opposition to privatization efforts
- **Parent and Community Groups**: Organizing around individual schools and districts
- **Educator Organizations**: Professional associations advocating for public education

### Strategic Approaches
Successful resistance strategies have included:
- Community organizing and coalition building
- Public education about privatization implications
- Electoral engagement to support public education candidates
- Media advocacy to increase transparency

## Broader Policy Implications

### State-Level Context
Charleston's privatization push occurs within broader South Carolina policy trends:
- Legislative support for charter school expansion
- Efforts to create "turnaround districts" with reduced oversight
- Attempts to divert COVID-19 relief funds to private schools
- Support for voucher programs

### National Patterns
The Charleston case reflects national privatization strategies:
- Use of crisis narratives to justify market-based reforms
- Dark money organizational structures
- Targeting of communities with limited political power
- Public-private partnerships as stepping stones to full privatization

## Recommendations for Educational Justice

### Strengthening Democratic Governance
1. **Transparency Requirements**: Mandate disclosure of funding sources for organizations spending money on school board elections
2. **Community Engagement**: Develop meaningful processes for community input in education policy decisions
3. **Conflict of Interest Policies**: Establish clear guidelines about relationships between board members and outside organizations

### Supporting Public Education
1. **Adequate Funding**: Address root causes of educational inequality through equitable funding formulas
2. **Community Schools Model**: Invest in wraparound services and community-centered approaches
3. **Teacher Support**: Improve working conditions, compensation, and professional development
4. **Infrastructure Investment**: Address facilities and technology needs through public investment

### Strengthening Teacher Education
1. **Critical Policy Literacy**: Prepare educators to understand and engage with education policy debates
2. **Community Engagement Skills**: Develop capacities for meaningful community partnership
3. **Equity-Centered Practice**: Center educational justice in all teacher preparation programs
4. **Research and Advocacy**: Support action research that documents community needs and effective practices

## Lessons for Other Communities

### Early Warning Signs
Communities can identify potential privatization efforts by monitoring:
- Large-scale spending by outside organizations in school board elections
- Proposals for public-private partnerships presented as urgent reforms
- Language emphasizing "innovation" and "choice" without addressing systemic inequities
- Dark money organizations with hidden funding sources

### Effective Resistance Strategies
1. **Coalition Building**: Unite educators, parents, and community members around shared values
2. **Research and Documentation**: Gather evidence about privatization outcomes in other contexts
3. **Media Engagement**: Use local media to increase transparency and public awareness
4. **Electoral Participation**: Support candidates committed to strengthening public education
5. **Policy Advocacy**: Engage at state and local levels to strengthen democratic governance

### Alternative Vision Development
Rather than simply opposing privatization, communities can:
- Develop positive visions for public education improvement
- Create community-led school improvement initiatives
- Build partnerships with universities and community organizations
- Advocate for evidence-based reforms that strengthen rather than weaken public governance

## Long-term Implications

### For Educational Equity
The Charleston case demonstrates how privatization efforts can:
- Exacerbate existing inequalities rather than address them
- Remove democratic oversight from educational decision-making
- Prioritize market mechanisms over community needs
- Undermine professional educator expertise and autonomy

### For Democratic Governance
The use of dark money in school board elections raises broader questions about:
- The influence of wealthy interests in local democratic processes
- The need for campaign finance reform at the local level
- The importance of transparent decision-making in public institutions
- The role of community voice in educational governance

## Research Questions for Future Investigation

### Effectiveness Studies
- What are the long-term academic outcomes for students in privatized versus strengthened public schools?
- How do community engagement levels differ between public and public-private partnership schools?
- What are the fiscal implications of privatization for overall district resources?

### Democratic Participation
- How does dark money spending affect voter participation and candidate quality in school board elections?
- What governance structures best support meaningful community participation in educational decision-making?
- How can teacher education programs better prepare educators for political engagement?

### Equity Analysis
- How do privatization efforts differentially impact communities based on race, class, and geography?
- What are the long-term implications for educational equity of market-based reforms?
- How can communities center racial and economic justice in education policy advocacy?

## Conclusion

The Charleston County school privatization battle represents a microcosm of national debates about the future of public education. The systematic use of dark money to influence local school board elections, combined with proposals to transfer public schools to private management, demonstrates the sophisticated nature of contemporary privatization efforts.

However, the strong community resistance and declining electoral success of privatization advocates also demonstrates the potential for effective organizing around educational justice. The involvement of teacher educators in this struggle highlights the professional responsibility of those who prepare future educators to engage with the political realities of their profession.

The case underscores several critical principles for defending and strengthening public education:

1. **Transparency and Democratic Governance**: Educational decision-making must be transparent, inclusive, and accountable to the communities it serves.

2. **Community-Centered Solutions**: Meaningful educational improvement requires deep engagement with affected communities rather than top-down reform initiatives.

3. **Systemic Approaches**: Addressing educational inequality requires attention to broader social and economic inequities, not just school-level interventions.

4. **Professional Responsibility**: Educators and teacher educators have ethical obligations to advocate for policies that serve students and communities rather than private interests.

5. **Long-term Vision**: Building effective resistance to privatization requires developing compelling alternative visions for public education that address legitimate concerns about educational quality and equity.

The struggle over education in Charleston County continues to evolve, with the 2022 electoral setbacks for the Coalition for Kids representing a significant victory for public education advocates. However, privatization efforts at the state level continue, and the underlying conditions that make communities vulnerable to these initiativesâ€”educational inequality, resource constraints, and political disenfranchisementâ€”remain largely unaddressed.

For teacher educators and others committed to educational justice, the Charleston case provides both cautionary lessons and grounds for hope. It demonstrates the sophistication and resources of privatization advocates while also showing the potential for effective community resistance. Most importantly, it underscores the ongoing need for sustained engagement in the political dimensions of education, recognizing that the future of public education depends not just on what happens in classrooms, but on who controls the policies and resources that shape educational opportunities.

The fight for educational justice in Charleston County serves as a reminder that democracy in education, like democracy itself, requires constant vigilance and active participation from those committed to equity, transparency, and community empowerment.
