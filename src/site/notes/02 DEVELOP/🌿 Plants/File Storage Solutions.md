## Implementation Pathways

### Pathway 1: Start Self-Hosted (High Technical Capacity)
**Timeline:** 6-12 months

1. **Infrastructure Setup** (Months 1-2) — Choose hosting, deploy Nextcloud
2. **Feature Configuration** (Months 3-4) — Install ONLYOFFICE, configure permissions
3. **Migration & Training** (Months 5-6) — Migrate files, train users

### Pathway 2: Start Cooperative, Transition Later (Balanced)
**Timeline:** 3-6 months to operational

1. **Immediate Deployment** (Month 1) — Sign up with cooperative provider
2. **Community Onboarding** (Months 2-3) — Train users, establish conventions
3. **Technical Capacity Building** (Months 6-12) — Train internal team
4. **Optional Transition** (Months 12-18) — Migrate to self-hosting if desired

### Pathway 3: Privacy Cloud (Low Technical Burden)
**Timeline:** 1-3 months

1. **Service Selection** (Month 1) — Evaluate and negotiate pricing
2. **Migration Planning** (Month 2) — Map file structures
3. **Deployment** (Month 3) — Migrate and train

## Backup & Disaster Recovery

### The 3-2-1 Rule (Critical)
- **3 copies** of important data
- **2 different media types** (local + cloud)
- **1 offsite backup** (geographic separation)

### Self-Hosted Backup Strategy
- Daily automated backups to separate storage
- Weekly offsite backups to different location
- Monthly backup testing with restoration procedures
- Quarterly disaster recovery drills

---

## Security Considerations

### Access Control
- Multi-factor authentication required
- Role-based permissions by function
- Regular access audits
- Guest access controls for external collaboration

### Encryption Standards
- Encryption at rest for all files
- Encryption in transit for all transfers
- End-to-end encryption for sensitive documents
- Key management with secure backup
