# Media Literacy

## Core Definition

Media literacy is the ability to access, analyze, evaluate, create, and act on media in all its forms. It encompasses critical thinking skills to understand how media messages are constructed, why they are produced, and how they influence thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Media literacy extends beyond consumption to include the ability to create and share media responsibly while understanding the social, cultural, and political contexts that shape media production and distribution.

In the digital age, media literacy has become an essential life skill, requiring individuals to navigate complex information ecosystems, understand algorithmic influence, and participate meaningfully in democratic discourse while protecting themselves from manipulation and misinformation.

## Foundational Framework

### Core Principles of Media Literacy Education

**1. All Media Messages Are Constructed**
- Media content is created by people with specific intentions, biases, and constraints
- Understanding production processes reveals how meaning is shaped
- Recognition that no media message is neutral or objective

**2. Media Messages Are Created Using a Creative Language**
- Each medium has its own grammar, syntax, and conventions
- Visual, audio, and textual elements work together to create meaning
- Technical choices (camera angles, editing, typography) influence interpretation

**3. Different People Experience the Same Media Message Differently**
- Individual backgrounds, experiences, and cultural contexts affect interpretation
- Audience demographics influence how messages are received and understood
- Multiple valid readings of media content exist

**4. Media Have Embedded Values and Points of View**
- All media content reflects the values and worldview of its creators
- Commercial, political, and social motivations shape content production
- Understanding perspective helps identify bias and agenda

**5. Most Media Are Organized to Gain Profit and/or Power**
- Economic and political structures influence media production and distribution
- Advertising revenue, audience metrics, and political influence affect content
- Understanding media ownership and funding reveals potential conflicts of interest

### Critical Questions Framework

**Authorship Questions:**
- Who created this message and why?
- What techniques are used to attract and hold attention?
- What is the purpose of this message?

**Economics Questions:**
- Who paid for this message?
- How might the funding source influence the content?
- What economic interests are served?

**Impact Questions:**
- Who might benefit from this message? Who might be harmed?
- Why might this message matter to me?
- What action might I take based on this message?

**Content Questions:**
- What ideas, values, information, and/or points of view are included or omitted?
- How might different people understand this message differently?
- What techniques are used to make this message credible and believable?
