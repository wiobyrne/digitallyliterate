# Discourse 2.0: Evolution of Communication in Web 2.0 Environments

## Defining Discourse 2.0
**Discourse 2.0** represents the evolution of online communication that emerged alongside **Web 2.0 platforms**â€”web-based environments incorporating user-generated content and social interaction, often alongside or in response to structures and multimedia content provided by the platforms themselves.

## Foundational Characteristics of Web 2.0 Communication

### Platform Integration and Convergence
**Multi-Modal Communication Convergence**
A defining characteristic of Web 2.0 environments is the **co-occurrence or convergence of different modes of communication on a single platform**, creating rich, interconnected communication ecosystems that blend:
- Text-based communication (posts, comments, messages)
- Visual communication (images, videos, graphics)
- Interactive elements (likes, shares, reactions)
- Collaborative features (editing, co-creation, annotation)

**Unified Communication Ecosystems**
- Single platforms supporting multiple communication types simultaneously
- Seamless integration between different interaction modes
- Cross-modal referencing and conversation threading
- Unified identity across diverse communication activities

## New Content Types in Discourse 2.0
