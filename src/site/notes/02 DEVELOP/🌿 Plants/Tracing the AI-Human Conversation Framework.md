# Tracing the AI-Human Conversation Framework

The 5-part framework (Inputs, Prompts, Outputs, Integration, Reflection) is strong. To make it even clearer for a conference audience, group the first three as the **Observed Interaction** and the last two as the **Learner's Response/Boundary Work**.

Here is the framework, with an emphasis on the "boundary-work" as  intended:

|**Framework Component**|**Focus (What is Analyzed)**|**Boundary Work/Agency Evidence**|
|---|---|---|
|1. **Inputs** 📚|How they **curated sources** and **framed the problem**.|**Agency over Knowledge Base:** Did they select sources that challenge or expand the course's perspective?|
|2. **Prompts** 💬|How they **directed or constrained** the AI's response.|**Agency over Cognitive Task:** Were prompts complex, asking for critique, synthesis, or comparison? (Did they demand _thinking_?)|
|3. **Outputs** 💻|The **AI model's response**.|**Boundary Setting:** Did the output's quality or bias force them to correct or refuse it?|
|4. **Integration** ✏️|How they **transformed, rejected, or incorporated** the AI output into their final work.|**Boundary of Authorship/Trust:** Evidence of **modification** (high agency), **rejection** (high critical stance), or **incorporation** (low agency).|
|5. **Reflection** 🧠|How they **articulated boundaries, ethics, and epistemic stance**.|**Metacognitive Boundary:** Explicit statements about _who_ is responsible for _what_ in the final knowledge product.|

**Conclusion:** Both the analytical framework and your methodological justification are academically rigorous and perfectly suited for a research presentation. The term "**Micro-interactional analysis**" is precise and compelling for describing the case study's deep focus.

The 5-part framework is built around analyzing the entire workflow, which we can categorize into two main phases: the **Observed Interaction** and the **Learner's Boundary Work**.

### Phase 1: The Observed Interaction (Items 1, 2, 3)

This phase captures the direct back-and-forth between the student and Notebook LM, showing the raw materials and the first response.

|**Component**|**Focus (What is Analyzed)**|**Why It Matters for Your Presentation**|
|---|---|---|
|**1. Inputs** 📚|**Curated Sources & Problem Framing:** What knowledge did the student feed the AI, and how did they set up the task?|**Agency over Knowledge Base:** This reveals the student's _initial boundary_—are they limiting the conversation to just the assigned readings, or are they bringing in outside, critical sources to **challenge** the AI?|
|**2. Prompts** 💬|**Direction & Constraint:** The specific questions or commands the student used.|**Agency over Cognitive Task:** This is the best place to find evidence of **critical engagement**. Simple prompts ask the AI to summarize (low effort); complex prompts ask it to **critique, compare, or argue** (demanding _thinking_ and setting a high intellectual boundary).|
|**3. Outputs** 💻|**The AI Model's Response:** What the AI actually delivered.|**Boundary Setting:** The _quality_ and _bias_ of the output force the student to decide what to do next. An unsatisfactory or biased output is a key moment where the student must **intervene** (set a boundary).|

### Phase 2: The Learner's Boundary Work (Items 4, 5)

This phase focuses on the student's response to the AI's contribution, which is where the "co-construction" of roles, ethics, and effort is most visible.

|**Component**|**Focus (What is Analyzed)**|**Why It Matters for Your Presentation**|
|---|---|---|
|**4. Integration** ✏️|**Transformation, Rejection, or Incorporation:** How did the AI text end up in the final project?|**Boundary of Authorship/Trust:** This is your evidence of **agency in action**. * **High Agency:** They **modified** or **transformed** the text, showing they saw the AI as a draft creator, not a final author. * **High Critical Stance:** They **rejected** the text entirely, demonstrating critical thinking and refusal to trust the output.|
|**5. Reflection** 🧠|**Articulation of Boundaries, Ethics, and Epistemic Stance:** The student's commentary on the process.|**Metacognitive Boundary:** This provides the students' own words on _who is responsible for what_. Look for statements where they assign responsibility—e.g., "The AI did the synthesis, but I had to correct the logic," clarifying the ultimate human responsibility for the **final knowledge product**.|

In short, this framework shows not just _what_ the students did, but _why_ they did it, and how their actions in the Notebook LM workspace demonstrate the difficult process of **setting and adjusting the rules** for an AI partnership.
