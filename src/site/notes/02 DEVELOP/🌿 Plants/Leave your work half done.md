# Leave your work half done


One of the most effective hacks used by successful people is leaving your work half done at the end of the day. This might seem counterintuitive, but it can significantly boost your efficiency and motivation levels.

The idea behind this strategy comes from a psychological phenomenon called the Zeigarnik effect, named after Russian psychologist Bluma Zeigarnik. She found that people remember unfinished tasks better than completed ones. So if you stop working on a task halfway through, it stays active in your mind.

By leaving work half done, you create a cognitive tension or a mental itch that can only be relieved by finishing what you started. This creates an inherent desire to get back to work and finish the task. Moreover, it's easier to start your day with something already in progress rather than starting from scratch.

In addition to boosting productivity and motivation, this strategy can also help reduce procrastination. Knowing that you've already made progress towards a task can make it less intimidating and easier to dive back into. It also gives you a clear starting point for the next day, eliminating the time and mental energy spent deciding what to do first.

Furthermore, leaving your work half done can help promote better work-life balance. When you leave tasks unfinished at the end of the day, it allows you to mentally disengage from your work and be fully present in your personal life. The desire to finish the task will still be there, but it won't dominate your thoughts and prevent you from enjoying your downtime.

However, this strategy should be used with caution. Leaving every task half done can lead to chaos and inefficiency. It's important to find a balance - leave larger projects or complex tasks half done, while finishing simpler or time-sensitive tasks completely.

In conclusion, leaving your work half done at the end of the day can improve productivity and motivation, reduce procrastination, promote better work-life balance, and provide a clear starting point for the next day. By strategically utilizing this method, you can enhance both your efficiency and overall job satisfaction.
