# Illiberalism

## **Definition**  
Illiberalism refers to a political ideology or system that opposes liberal principles such as democracy, individual rights, and the rule of law.

## **Explain Like I'm 5**  
Imagine a playground where one child makes all the rules and doesn't let others play freely or have a say in what games to choose. That's like illiberalism, where a leader restricts people's freedoms and doesn't follow fair rules.

## **Visualization**

## **Digging Deeper**
Illiberalism often involves centralized power, censorship, suppression of opposition, and disregard for human rights. Leaders in illiberal systems may prioritize their own interests over those of the people they govern. Examples include authoritarian regimes like North Korea or Russia.

## **Applications**  
- Illiberalism can be seen in authoritarian governments that limit freedom of speech and expression.
- It can manifest in restrictions on civil liberties and human rights in certain countries.
- Illiberal tendencies can also be observed in populist movements that undermine democratic institutions.
- Some political parties may adopt illiberal tactics to maintain power.
- Illiberalism can impact international relations when countries with such ideologies clash with liberal democracies.
