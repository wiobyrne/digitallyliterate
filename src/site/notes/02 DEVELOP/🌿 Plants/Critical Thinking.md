# Critical Thinking

## Core Definition

Critical thinking is the disciplined process of actively and skillfully conceptualizing, applying, analyzing, synthesizing, and evaluating information gathered from observation, experience, reflection, reasoning, or communication to guide belief and action. It involves the ability to think clearly and rationally, understanding logical connections between ideas, identifying and challenging assumptions, and evaluating evidence objectively.

Critical thinking transcends simple analysis to encompass intellectual virtues such as intellectual humility, curiosity, integrity, and courage. In the digital age, critical thinking has become essential for navigating information abundance, detecting manipulation, and making informed decisions in complex, rapidly changing environments.

## Foundational Framework

### Core Components of Critical Thinking

**1. Analysis**
- Breaking down complex information into component parts
- Identifying relationships between ideas and concepts
- Recognizing patterns, themes, and underlying structures
- Distinguishing between fact, opinion, and interpretation

**2. Interpretation**
- Understanding meaning and significance of information
- Recognizing context and perspective
- Drawing reasonable inferences from available evidence
- Translating information across different domains and formats

**3. Evaluation**
- Assessing credibility and reliability of sources
- Judging the strength of arguments and evidence
- Identifying logical fallacies and reasoning errors
- Weighing competing claims and perspectives

**4. Inference**
- Drawing logical conclusions from available information
- Identifying implications and consequences
- Forming hypotheses and predictions
- Connecting disparate pieces of information

**5. Explanation**
- Clearly articulating reasoning processes
- Providing evidence to support conclusions
- Identifying assumptions and presuppositions
- Communicating complex ideas effectively

**6. Self-Regulation**
- Monitoring one's own thinking processes (metacognition)
- Recognizing personal biases and limitations
- Adjusting thinking strategies based on feedback
- Continuous improvement of reasoning skills

### Intellectual Virtues and Dispositions

**Intellectual Humility**

## Cognitive Processes and Mental Models

### System 1 vs System 2 Thinking (Kahneman Framework)
