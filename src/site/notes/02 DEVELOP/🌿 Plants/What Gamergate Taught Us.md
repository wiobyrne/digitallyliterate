# What Gamergate Taught Us
## and Why It Matters for Today’s News

## Key Lessons from Gamergate

Gamergate, which began in 2014, was an explosive online campaign that started over supposed concerns about ethics in video game journalism but quickly spiraled into harassment, especially targeting women and people advocating for diversity in gaming. The way the controversy unfolded had significant consequences for how misinformation, harassment, and public debates play out online—and is still relevant in today’s news landscape[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamergate)[2](https://theweek.com/culture-life/what-was-gamergate-and-why-are-we-still-talking-about-it)[3](https://ktvz.com/news/national-world/cnn-national/2025/03/23/how-gamergate-foreshadowed-the-toxic-hellscape-that-the-internet-has-now-become/).

## Major Takeaways:

- **Online Mobs Can Be Manipulated:** Gamergate showed that a small group of bad actors could stir up outrage online, exaggerate or invent claims, and make it seem like there was a far larger movement than actually existed. Corporations and news outlets sometimes reacted to these manufactured outrages without fully understanding the reality or the motivations behind them[4](https://www.vox.com/culture/2020/1/20/20808875/gamergate-lessons-cultural-impact-changes-harassment-laws)[5](https://www.metafilter.com/185233/What-we-still-havent-learned-from-Gamergate).
    
- **Blurred Lines Between Good Faith and Bad Faith:** Many people claimed to be acting out of genuine concern (“we just want better journalism!”), while others were engaging in harassment. This allowed some to try to distance themselves from the worst behavior, while still benefiting from the chaos and attention the outrage created[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamergate)[6](https://christandpopculture.com/hearts-minds-can-learn-gamergate/).
    
- **Disinformation and Trolling Tactics Spread:** Gamergate became a “playbook” for future campaigns. Techniques like mass-reporting, doxxing, dogpiling, and the use of memes to confuse or hide real intentions have since become common in larger political and cultural battles, including those involving “fake news” and misinformation[3](https://ktvz.com/news/national-world/cnn-national/2025/03/23/how-gamergate-foreshadowed-the-toxic-hellscape-that-the-internet-has-now-become/)[2](https://theweek.com/culture-life/what-was-gamergate-and-why-are-we-still-talking-about-it)[7](https://www.npr.org/2019/08/30/756034720/how-gamergate-became-a-template-for-malicious-action-online).
    
- **Social Media and Newsrooms Struggled:** Platforms like Twitter and Reddit were unprepared for coordinated harassment and misinformation campaigns. Traditional newsrooms didn’t always know how to cover these online controversies responsibly, sometimes inadvertently giving bad actors more attention and legitimacy[3](https://ktvz.com/news/national-world/cnn-national/2025/03/23/how-gamergate-foreshadowed-the-toxic-hellscape-that-the-internet-has-now-become/)[8](https://www.cjr.org/behind_the_news/gamergate.php)[9](https://niemanreports.org/what-gamergate-can-teach-journalists-about-handling-twitter-storms/).
    
- **Long-term Impact:** Many of the figures and tactics from Gamergate migrated into other areas, seeding future fights over “culture wars” and amplifying ideological divides, both within online communities and in wider society[2](https://theweek.com/culture-life/what-was-gamergate-and-why-are-we-still-talking-about-it)[3](https://ktvz.com/news/national-world/cnn-national/2025/03/23/how-gamergate-foreshadowed-the-toxic-hellscape-that-the-internet-has-now-become/)[10](https://www.theblaze.com/return/gamergate-at-10-what-did-it-mean-and-why-do-we-still-care).
    

## How Gamergate Shapes Our News Ecosystem Now

- **“Both Sides” Reporting Challenge:** News outlets often attempted to “balance” coverage, even when one side was motivated by bad faith or by harassment, leading to confusion about what was actually happening[8](https://www.cjr.org/behind_the_news/gamergate.php)[3](https://ktvz.com/news/national-world/cnn-national/2025/03/23/how-gamergate-foreshadowed-the-toxic-hellscape-that-the-internet-has-now-become/)[9](https://niemanreports.org/what-gamergate-can-teach-journalists-about-handling-twitter-storms/).
    
- **Misinformation Goes Mainstream:** The same strategies to muddy the truth and harass individuals have been copied in many later campaigns—such as QAnon, election denial, or COVID-19 misinformation—showing that the lessons of Gamergate were not fully learned or acted upon by social media companies, journalists, or society at large[3](https://ktvz.com/news/national-world/cnn-national/2025/03/23/how-gamergate-foreshadowed-the-toxic-hellscape-that-the-internet-has-now-become/)[2](https://theweek.com/culture-life/what-was-gamergate-and-why-are-we-still-talking-about-it)[5](https://www.metafilter.com/185233/What-we-still-havent-learned-from-Gamergate).
    

## Explaining Gamergate and These Situations to Kids

## For a Fifth Grader (10–11 Years Old)

Imagine you and your friends love playing video games. One day, someone starts a rumor online that a game reviewer gave a good review just because they were friends with a game creator. Instead of checking if the story is true, people online get very angry and start sending mean, scary messages to the game creator and others—especially women and people who want games to be fun for everyone.

Some people say they just want “honest reviews,” but in reality, a lot of what happens is bullying. It’s important to check facts and not join in just because others are being loud or angry. And it’s never okay to let people be treated badly or threatened, no matter what the argument is about[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamergate)[11](https://mediaschool.indiana.edu/news-events/news/item.html?n=gamergate-cultural-change-begins-in-classroom)[12](https://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2014/09/24/349835297/-gamergate-controversy-fuels-debate-on-women-and-video-games).

## Why This Still Matters

The ways that people acted online during Gamergate—a mix of mean behavior, rumors, and trying to silence others—are still happening online today, in games, news, and even politics. We all need to be careful about what we believe and how we treat others online.

## For a Five-Year-Old

Sometimes, when people play games, they argue about what’s fair. But if somebody starts being really mean or saying things that aren’t true just to hurt others, that’s not okay. We should always be kind online, and if someone is getting bullied or lied about, it’s important to help them, not join the crowd[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamergate)[11](https://mediaschool.indiana.edu/news-events/news/item.html?n=gamergate-cultural-change-begins-in-classroom).

## In Summary

- **Gamergate** taught us how quickly misinformation and “fake news” can spread online, how easy it is for mean-spirited behavior to get out of control, and why it’s so important for both news organizations and regular people to question what they see and not join in bad behavior.
    
- **For kids:** Always look for the truth, don’t join in when someone is being hurt, and remember that being kind online is just as important as being kind in person.
