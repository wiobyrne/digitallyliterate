# How learners should engage Large Language Models framework

## Framework Justification: Mollick & Mollick (2023)

## Core Thesis

This analytic framework builds directly on **Mollick & Mollick’s (2023) “Assigning AI: Seven Approaches for Students, with Prompts.”** Their work outlines how students *should* engage Large Language Models (LLMs) through intentional prompts, explicit oversight, structured reflection, and transparent integration.

I adapted their **pedagogical roles** (Tutor, Coach, Mentor, etc.) into a **research lens**—shifting the focus from *“how students should use AI”* to *“how students actually used AI in authentic literacy inquiry.”*

## Theoretical Contribution (Adaptation)

Where Mollick & Mollick provide a pedagogical scaffold for classroom practice, this project turns those scaffolds into a **qualitative analytic lens**, allowing us to examine how preservice literacy educators actually enacted these roles and responsibilities and negotiated **[[03 CREATE/🌲 Evergreens/Boundary-work\|Boundary-work]]** and **[[03 CREATE/🌲 Evergreens/Epistemic Stance\|Epistemic Stance]]** in authentic inquiry.

The adaptation transforms their guidance into:

* **An analytic tool** for qualitative coding.
* **A lens** on real student interactions and artifacts.
* **A model** for studying AI-mediated literacy practices.

## Direct Connections to Source Text

The framework's structure is a direct methodological response to key Mollick & Mollick guidelines:

| Framework Component | Direct M&M Connection | Key Quote / Concept |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Inputs** | Setting the stage for the AI’s function. | “Provide context and goals to the AI.” (M&M, various prompts) |
| **Prompts** | The core mechanism for defining the interaction. | “Assign roles” & shape the AI’s function (e.g., AI-Tutor, AI-Coach). |
| **Outputs** | The need for vigilance and assessment. | “Avoid complacency about AI responses.” Emphasis on hallucination and bias risks. |
| **Integration** | The requirement for synthesis and judgment. | “Students must remain the human in the loop.” Avoid outsourcing analysis. |
| **Reflection** | The crucial step for learning and ethical development. | Explicit requirement to “Prompt metacognition” (AI as Coach) and articulate takeaways. |

### **. Inputs – What they upload**

This aligns with the essential action of **Prompting** discussed throughout the paper. The quality and nature of the input heavily influence the AI's utility. The paper highlights the importance of providing **context and clear goals** when students are engaging the AI in roles like **AI Mentor** or **AI Tutor**.

- **Source Connection:** The entire paper revolves around **prompts**—the inputs students use to assign roles and tasks to the AI. For example, the detailed prompts for **AI as Mentor** instruct students to clearly articulate their goals and learning level as part of the initial input.

### **2. Prompts – How they engage the AI**

This is a central concept in the source material, as the paper is subtitled "with **Prompts**." This part of your framework captures the student's **agency** and **strategy** in directing the AI.

- **Source Connection:** The paper dedicates sections to "Example Prompts" for all seven approaches (Tutor, Coach, Mentor, etc.), underscoring the critical role of the prompt in shaping the learning experience and output.
    

---

### **3. Outputs – What the model produces**

This directly corresponds to the AI's response and is a core component that the students must **critically assess** according to the authors.

- **Source Connection:** The document repeatedly discusses the **risks** associated with the AI's output, such as **Confabulation** (hallucination) and **Bias Risks**. Students are challenged to remain the "**human in the loop**" and not develop "**complacency about the AI’s output**," making the nature of the Output a crucial point of analysis.
    

---

### **4. Integration – How outputs shape the final project**

This step analyzes the **Boundary-work** between the student's original effort and the AI's contribution. It moves beyond simple output analysis to examine the ultimate application and synthesis of the AI-generated material.

- **Source Connection:** The paper's guidelines consistently push students to "**actively oversee the AIs output, check with reliable sources, and complement any AI output with their unique perspectives and insights**." This process of _complementing_ and _integrating_ the AI's work into the final student product is exactly what this step captures.
    

---

### **5. Reflections – Metacognitive and ethical insights**

This is strongly supported by the paper's focus on **metacognition** and responsibility. It directly addresses the **epistemic stance** (how students view knowledge and their role in creating it) and **ethical agency**.

- **Source Connection:**
    
    - **Metacognition:** The **AI as Coach** approach is explicitly defined as "**Prompt metacognition**" with the pedagogical benefit of providing "**Opportunities for reflection and regulation, which improve learning outcomes**." The reflection prompts provided in the paper are designed to make students articulate their thoughts about the experience.
        
    - **Ethical/Accountability:** The student guidelines for the **AI as Mentor** state: "**Share your complete interactions with the AI... What are some of your takeaways in working with the AI?**" and explicitly warn about privacy risks, emphasizing accountability and ethical use.
        

## 💡 Highlighting Core Concepts

Your framework effectively captures the three core concepts you mentioned by breaking down the student-AI interaction:

- **Agency:** Highlighted in **Inputs** and **Prompts**, where the student actively makes choices to direct the AI.
    
- **Boundary-work:** Captured in **Integration**, where the student separates and combines their own work with the AI's output.
    
- **Epistemic Stance:** Explored in **Reflections** and the critical evaluation of **Outputs**, where the student determines the trustworthiness and value of the AI's "knowledge."
