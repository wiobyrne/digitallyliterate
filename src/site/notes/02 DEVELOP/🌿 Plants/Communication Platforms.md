## Top Recommendations

| Accessibility | 23+ languages, progressive web app |

**Migration Features:**
- Bridges to Discord/Slack for gradual transition
- Export/import tools prevent data loss
- Parallel operation during learning period

**Costs:**

- **Community control** — run your own server or choose ethical hosts
- **Interoperability** — communicate across different Matrix servers
- **Long-term sustainability** — not dependent on single company decisions

### Centralized Benefits (Signal)
- **Simpler user experience** — no server choices to make
- **Consistent security** — uniform encryption across all users
- **Lower barriers** — works immediately without setup
