# Community-Centered AI

## **Definition**
AI systems designed, governed, and operated to strengthen community networks and serve local values, with meaningful democratic control rather than corporate optimization for profit or engagement.

## **Explain Like I'm 5**
Imagine if your neighborhood had its own special robot helper that everyone in the community helped decide how to use. Instead of a big company far away controlling the robot, your neighbors would work together to make sure it helped with things your community actually cared about.

## **Visualization**

## **Digging Deeper**
Community-centered AI represents an alternative to both unrestricted corporate AI development and government regulation alone. It emphasizes local democratic control, transparent operation, and value alignment with specific communities rather than generic users. This approach recognizes that different communities have different needs, values, and priorities that should shape how AI systems operate in their context. Key principles include meaningful community input in AI design and deployment decisions, understandable and modifiable AI behavior, economic models that benefit communities rather than extracting value, and governance structures that maintain democratic accountability over technological systems.

## **Applications**
- **Local Content Moderation**: Community-controlled algorithms for social platforms that reflect local values and context
- **Municipal Services**: AI systems for city services designed with meaningful resident input and transparent operation
- **Community Healthcare**: AI diagnostic and health monitoring systems owned and governed by community health cooperatives
- **Educational AI**: Learning systems designed by and for specific school communities rather than generic corporate products
- **Economic Development**: AI tools for local economic analysis and development controlled by community organizations
