# The Logic of Connective Action

The **Logic of Connective Action**, a framework pioneered by Lance Bennett and Alexandra Segerberg, marks a fundamental departure from how we understand political mobilization. For decades, the gold standard for social change was "collective action," a model defined by formal organizations like labor unions or political parties. In that world, if you wanted to change the law, you joined a group, paid dues, and adopted a shared ideology. Today, however, we are witnessing a shift toward a model where digital media is not just a tool for communication, but the very "organizing principle" of the movement itself.

### From Collective to Connective

The core difference between these two logics lies in the "cost" of participation and the "nature" of the identity. Collective action requires high levels of **organizational resource mobilization**. An institution must act as a "broker," aligning diverse individuals under a single, often rigid, group identity. This process is slow, expensive, and requires individuals to subordinate their personal stories to the "party line."

In contrast, **connective action** is driven by **personal expression**. In an "individuated society," citizens are less likely to "join" an organization and more likely to "share" a cause. Instead of a top-down hierarchy, connective action relies on **digital networks** to coordinate activity. The "social glue" isn't a membership card; it is the personalized version of a story that travels through peer-to-peer networks.

### The Mechanism of Scaling

How does a movement grow without a "headquarters"? The mechanism of connective action is the **Personalized Action Frame**. These are inclusive, easily adaptable slogans or symbols (like #BlackLivesMatter or "We Are the 99%") that allow individuals to project their own life experiences onto a larger cause.

Because these frames are "easy to travel" and "hard to get wrong," they scale virally. Digital platforms provide the **technical affordances**—the hashtags, the "share" buttons, and the real-time feedback loops—that perform the organizational labor that used to require a physical office and a dedicated staff. In this model, the "code" of the platform serves as the "rules" of the organization.

### Features of Connective Action

- **Low Barriers to Entry:** Participation often begins with a simple digital act, such as sharing a video or adding a frame to a profile picture.
- **Self-Organizing:** The network is responsive and can pivot in real-time without waiting for a committee decision.
- **Distributed Power:** There is no single "off switch" or leader to target, making these movements resilient against traditional institutional suppression.

### The Trade-off: Sustainability vs. Speed

While the logic of connective action allows for breathtakingly rapid mobilization, it faces a **sustainability challenge**. Without the "thick" institutional bonds of traditional organizations, these movements can struggle to maintain momentum once the digital spotlight shifts. They are excellent at "disruption" but can find it difficult to transition into the "lobbying" or "policy-making" phase that requires long-term, resource-heavy commitment.

Ultimately, the logic of connective action reflects our modern reality: a world where the personal is political, and where the network is the most powerful tool for change.
