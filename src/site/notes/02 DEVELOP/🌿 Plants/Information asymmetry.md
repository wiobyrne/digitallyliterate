## Definition
Information asymmetry in technology design occurs when dominant groups embed their biases into products, creating solutions that don't serve marginalized communities.

## Core Concept

# Information asymmetry
Information asymmetry occurs when designers bake their biases into the design of a technology, resulting in a product that does not match the needs of all users. Because members of the dominant social group designed the product, the commodities and services center the needs of the designers but do not serve the needs of marginalized people (Costanza-Chock, 2020).

[[Lead user innovation\|Lead user innovation]] offers one way to combat information asymmetry, as lead user innovators tinker and democratize technologies in order to make them more just and functional.

When CS curriculum developers prioritize the needs of the industry, rather than interrogating how computing is used as a tool for oppression, it creates an information asymmetry between curriculum developers and teachers/learners. An example of information asymmetry is reflected in the K-12 computer science framework, which has been widely used to inform the computer science standards and curricula.
