# Building a Digital Commonplace Book

*A 21st-century system for capturing, curating, and creating*

> The commonplace book tradition — collecting passages and quotations organized by theme — meets modern knowledge management.

---

## The Challenge

In today's information-rich landscape:
- Knowledge organization remains essential for sense-making
- The proliferation of information requires robust systems
- Without a plan, saving digital tidbits becomes digital hoarding

---

## The Three-Stage System

### 1. Consume (Capture)

**Purpose:** Gather information from multiple streams

| Source | Tool | Flow |
|--------|------|------|
| Articles, blogs | Readwise Reader | Highlights sync to vault |
| Podcasts, videos | Manual notes | Key insights captured |
| Books | Kindle + Readwise | Annotations flow in |
| Social media | Bookmarks | Curated for later review |

**Key principle:** Capture widely, but with intention.

### 2. Curate (Process)

**Purpose:** Make sure you get "the good stuff"

- Regular review of captured material
- Progressive summarization to distill key ideas
- Tagging and linking to existing knowledge
- Periodic review cycles (weekly, monthly)

**Key principle:** Not everything captured deserves permanent residence.

### 3. Create (Synthesize)

**Purpose:** Generate new ideas and outputs

- Blog posts and newsletters
- Keynotes and presentations
- Teaching materials
- Research synthesis

**Key principle:** The system exists to support creation, not just collection.

## The Obsidian Implementation

### Folder Structure

```
01 CONSUME  — Incoming material, reading notes
02 DEVELOP  — Seeds, Plants, Evergreens (growing ideas)
03 CREATE   — Projects, outputs, finished work
04 META     — Templates, guides, system docs
```

### Note Maturity Tags

| Stage | Tag | Description |
|-------|-----|-------------|
| **Seed** | 🌱_seed | Fresh idea, rough, undeveloped |
| **Plant** | 🌿_plant | Growing, has structure, needs more |
| **Evergreen** | 🌲_evergreen | Mature, stable, polished |

Notes can exist in any folder at any stage. They evolve over time and may morph into different areas.

### Key Features

- **Backlinks** connect related ideas organically
- **Daily notes** for quick capture
- **Templates** ensure consistency
- **MOCs/Groves** cluster related concepts

## AI Integration (Optional)

**Starting point:** Google Keep → Google Drive → NotebookLM

This pathway helps you see what a "second brain" can do before building your own.

**Recommended evolution:**
1. Start with hosted tools to learn the patterns
2. Move to open-source tools (Obsidian) for ownership
3. Add local AI models for privacy and control

**RAG requirement:** Having all content in one space makes Retrieval-Augmented Generation possible — your AI can actually search your knowledge base.

---

## Critical Consumption

The system supports critical engagement:

- **Question sources** — Who created this? Why?
- **Identify bias** — What perspective is represented?
- **Synthesis over accumulation** — Don't just collect, connect
- **Regular pruning** — Remove what no longer serves

---

## Practical Tips

1. **Start small** — One capture tool, one processing habit
2. **Review weekly** — Process inbox, update notes
3. **Create monthly** — Turn processed material into outputs
4. **Iterate** — Your system should evolve with your needs

---

## The Goal

A digital commonplace book should help you:

- **Remember** what matters from your reading
- **Connect** ideas across domains
- **Create** new work from synthesized knowledge
- **Own** your knowledge system (not depend on platforms)
