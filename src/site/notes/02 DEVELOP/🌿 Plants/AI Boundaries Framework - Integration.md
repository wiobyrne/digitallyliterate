# AI Boundaries Framework - Integration

## Definition in This Study

**Integration** refers to how students incorporated, revised, resisted, or transformed AI outputs into their final work. This component captures the **boundary of authorship and trust**—the most visible evidence of [[03 CREATE/🌲 Evergreens/Boundary-work\|Boundary-work]] in the entire framework.

---

## Mollick & Mollick (2023) Connection

The Integration component resonates with M&M's core mandate:
- Students must **"remain the human in the loop"**
- Avoid **outsourcing analysis** to AI
- **Actively oversee** and **complement** AI output with human perspectives

**Key M&M Principle:** "Students should actively oversee the AI's output, check with reliable sources, and complement any AI output with their unique perspectives and insights."

This principle is most directly observable in how students integrate (or fail to integrate) AI outputs into their final work.

---

## What This Component Analyzes

### Primary Focus
- **Transformation:** Evidence of modification, revision, rewriting
- **Rejection:** Explicit refusal to use AI output
- **Incorporation:** How AI text appears in final work
- **Attribution:** How students mark AI vs. human contributions
- **Voice:** Whose voice is present in the final product?

### Secondary Focus
- Degree of human intellectual contribution
- Evidence of synthesis (not just stitching AI outputs together)
- Maintenance of authorial control

---

## Agency in Integration: The Authorship Decision

This component captures **[[03 CREATE/🌲 Evergreens/Agency\|Agency]] over Final Product:**

| High Agency Integration | Low Agency Integration |
|-------------------------|------------------------|
| Heavy modification/transformation | Copy-paste verbatim |
| Rejection of inadequate outputs | Uncritical incorporation |
| Synthesis with human voice | AI voice dominates |
| Clear attribution/boundaries | No marking of AI contribution |
| AI as draft; human as author | AI as author; human as editor |

---

## Integration Strategies: A Continuum

## Boundary-work in Integration

Integration is where [[03 CREATE/🌲 Evergreens/Boundary-work\|Boundary-work]] becomes **most visible:**

### Boundary-Setting Actions

| Action | Definition | Evidence of |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| **Restriction** | Using only parts of AI output | Selective use, high control |
| **Correction** | Fixing errors or bias | Critical evaluation, expertise |
| **Transformation** | Rewriting in own voice | Authorial ownership |
| **Synthesis** | Combining AI with human ideas | Co-construction |
| **Attribution** | Marking AI contributions | Ethical transparency |
| **Rejection** | Not using AI output | Strong epistemic stance |

---

## Key Analytic Questions

When coding Integration, ask:

1. **Transformation Level:**
   - How much did the student change the AI output?
   - Is it recognizably the AI's language or the student's?

2. **Voice:**
   - Whose voice is present in the final text?
   - Can you distinguish human from AI?

3. **Authorship:**
   - Who is the author of the final product?
   - Did the student maintain intellectual control?

4. **Attribution:**
   - Does the student mark what came from AI?
   - Is there transparency about AI use?

5. **Synthesis:**
   - Did the student integrate multiple sources (AI + human)?
   - Is there evidence of original thinking?

---

## Examples from Data

### High Agency Integration: Heavy Transformation
```
AI Output:
"Critical literacy emphasizes the importance of questioning
texts and understanding power dynamics in society."

Student Final Text:
"Rather than accepting texts as neutral conveyors of
information, critical literacy educators—following Freire
(1970) and Janks (2010)—position reading as an inherently
political act. Students learn to interrogate whose voices
are centered, whose are marginalized, and what ideological
work texts perform."
```
**Analysis:**
- Complete rewriting
- Human voice dominates
- Added citations and theoretical framing
- Moved from general to specific/scholarly
- AI served as thinking partner, not author

### Medium Agency Integration: Moderate Revision
```
AI Output:
"Teachers should scaffold literacy instruction to support
diverse learners."

Student Final Text:
"Teachers should scaffold literacy instruction to support
diverse learners, particularly through culturally sustaining
pedagogies (Paris & Alim, 2017) that honor students'
linguistic and cultural repertoires."
```
**Analysis:**
- Kept AI sentence structure
- Added scholarly citation and specificity
- Mixed voice (AI base + human enrichment)

### Low Agency Integration: Verbatim Copy-Paste
```
AI Output:
"Reading comprehension strategies include predicting,
questioning, clarifying, and summarizing."

Student Final Text:
"Reading comprehension strategies include predicting,
questioning, clarifying, and summarizing."
```
**Analysis:**
- No transformation
- AI voice present
- No human contribution visible
- AI positioned as author

### Highest Agency: Rejection
```
AI Output:
"The achievement gap can be closed through more rigorous
standards and accountability measures."

Student Response (in reflection):
"I rejected this output entirely because it frames the
issue through deficit thinking. Instead, I researched
opportunity gap frameworks (Ladson-Billings, 2006) and
wrote the section from scratch."
```
**Analysis:**
- Complete rejection
- Explicit rationale (deficit thinking)
- Student researches alternatives independently
- Strong epistemic stance

---

## Connection to [[03 CREATE/🌲 Evergreens/Epistemic Stance\|Epistemic Stance]]

Integration reveals epistemic stance about knowledge authority:

- **AI-Authoritative:** AI text incorporated verbatim; AI positioned as knowledge producer
- **Self-Authoritative:** Heavy transformation; human positioned as knowledge producer
- **Co-Constructed:** Synthesis of AI suggestions with human ideas; shared authorship

---

## Coding Categories for Integration

| Code | Definition | Example | Agency Level |
|------|------------|---------|--------------|
| **Verbatim** | Direct copy-paste, no changes | AI text unchanged | Low |
| **Light Edit** | Grammar/word choice only | Minor tweaks | Low-Medium |
| **Moderate Revision** | Some rewriting, AI structure visible | Enriched AI base | Medium |
| **Heavy Transformation** | Complete rewriting, human voice | AI as draft only | High |
| **Synthesis** | Integration of AI + human + sources | True co-construction | High |
| **Rejection** | AI output not used | Wrote independently | Highest |
| **Attribution** | Explicit marking of AI contribution | "AI suggested..." | Ethical |

## Relationship to Other Framework Components

- **← [[02 DEVELOP/🌿 Plants/Co-Constructing AI Boundaries Framework Component - Outputs\|Co-Constructing AI Boundaries Framework Component - Outputs]]:** Output quality influences integration approach
- **→ [[Co-Constructing AI Boundaries Framework Component - Reflection\|Co-Constructing AI Boundaries Framework Component - Reflection]]:** Students may reflect on integration decisions
- Integration is the **culmination** of earlier components (Inputs → Prompts → Outputs → **Integration**)

---

## The Critical Question: Who Is the Author?

Integration analysis ultimately asks: **Who is the author of this knowledge?**

M&M's framework assumes students must remain authors, even when using AI tools. Integration evidence reveals:
- Whether students maintained authorship
- Whether they outsourced intellectual labor
- Whether they "remained the human in the loop"

---

## Pedagogical Implications

**Teaching effective integration:**
1. Model transformation techniques (paraphrase, rewrite, synthesize)
2. Discuss authorship and intellectual property
3. Practice voice analysis (AI vs. human)
4. Teach attribution norms
5. Provide revision examples (AI draft → human final)
6. Emphasize transformation as learning (not just efficiency)
7. Make integration visible through reflection

---

## Special Case: Citation and Attribution

How students cite or attribute AI contributions reveals their understanding of authorship and boundaries:

| Attribution Practice | What It Reveals |
|---------------------|-----------------|
| **No attribution** | May indicate low awareness or intentional hiding |
| **Vague attribution** | "I used AI" (unclear boundaries) |
| **Specific attribution** | "AI suggested X, which I revised to Y" (clear boundaries) |
| **APA/MLA citation** | Treats AI as cited source (formal acknowledgment) |
| **Process description** | "I prompted AI to critique my draft" (tool use, not authorship) |

---

## Data Collection Notes

**Where to find evidence:**
- **Final projects:** Compare to NotebookLM outputs
- **Track changes:** If using collaborative docs
- **Reflections:** Student descriptions of integration process
- **Voice analysis:** Stylistic comparison (AI vs. student writing)
- **Citation practices:** How AI is acknowledged

**Triangulation:**
Compare NotebookLM outputs → Final project text → Student reflections
