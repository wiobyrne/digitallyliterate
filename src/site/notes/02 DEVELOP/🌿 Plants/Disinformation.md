# Disinformation

## Core Definition

Disinformation is false information deliberately created and distributed with the intent to deceive, mislead, or manipulate public opinion. Unlike misinformation (false information spread without malicious intent), disinformation involves purposeful deception by actors who know the information is false but disseminate it anyway to achieve specific political, economic, or social objectives.

Disinformation represents a deliberate weaponization of information, designed to exploit cognitive biases, erode trust in institutions, polarize communities, and undermine democratic discourse. In the digital age, disinformation campaigns can achieve unprecedented scale and sophistication through social media platforms, automated accounts, and micro-targeting technologies.

## Conceptual Framework

### Information Disorder Taxonomy

**Disinformation (False + Intentional Harm):**
- Content that is completely fabricated with intent to deceive
- Manipulated authentic content presented out of context
- Coordinated campaigns designed to influence opinion or behavior

**Misinformation (False + Unintentional Harm):**
- Inaccurate information shared without malicious intent
- Misunderstood content that spreads through well-meaning sharing
- Honest mistakes amplified through social networks

**Malinformation (True + Intentional Harm):**
- Authentic information shared to cause damage
- Leaked private content intended to harm individuals
- Selective disclosure of facts to mislead or manipulate

### Motivations Behind Disinformation

**Political Objectives:**
- Influencing elections and political processes
- Undermining trust in democratic institutions
- Polarizing communities and sowing social discord
- Advancing specific policy agendas through manufactured consent

**Economic Motivations:**
- Generating revenue through false advertising or engagement
- Market manipulation and financial fraud
- Undermining competitors or industries
- Creating artificial demand or panic

**Social and Ideological Goals:**
- Promoting extremist ideologies or conspiracy theories
- Targeting marginalized communities with harmful narratives
- Advancing religious or cultural supremacy narratives
- Creating in-group/out-group divisions

## Digital Age Amplification

### Platform Vulnerabilities
