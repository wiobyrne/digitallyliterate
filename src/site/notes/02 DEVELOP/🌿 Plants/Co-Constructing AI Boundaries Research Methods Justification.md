# Co-Constructing AI Boundaries Research Methods Justification


Your approach is rigorous because it combines established qualitative methods (case study, micro-interactional analysis, triangulation) with your newly adapted theoretical framework (the 5-part M&M model). The inclusion of students as **co-investigators** adds a valuable layer of participatory rigor, which is well-regarded in qualitative and educational research.

## 🚀 Justification Assessment

|Approach Detail|Assessment|Connection to Rigor|
|---|---|---|
|**Qualitative case study approach**|**Excellent.** Appropriate for an **in-depth, context-dependent** investigation of a complex phenomenon (AI-mediated literacy practice). The provided article by Naeem & Thomas (2025) explicitly supports this strategy for studying complex issues with AI integration.|Aligns with Yin's (2014) and Stake's (1995) goal of rich, contextualized analysis.|
|**Micro-interactional analysis of NotebookLM sessions**|**Strong.** This method is the perfect fit for your 5-part framework, as it allows you to zoom in on **Prompts, Outputs, and Integration** at the moment the student is making a decision.|Provides the **fine-grained data** necessary to capture _boundary-setting_ and moment-to-moment cognitive moves.|
|**Comparative cross-case coding using the 5-part framework**|**Excellent.** This explicitly turns the M&M pedagogical model into an **analytic tool** (your theoretical contribution). It provides **structure** and **focus** to your coding process, enhancing analytic rigor (Collins & Stockton, 2018).|Ensures **systematic analysis** across your data set and provides structure for interpreting complex events (Baxter & Chua, 2003).|
|**Attention to evidence of boundary-setting (restriction, correction, refusal, modification)**|**Crucial.** This is your primary analytic goal, focusing on **agency** and **epistemic stance**. These actions (restriction, refusal, etc.) are the visible enactments of the Mollick principle that the student must remain the "human in the loop."|Grounds abstract concepts (like _boundary-work_) in **observable data behaviors**, increasing validity and trustworthiness (Yin, 2014).|
|**Triangulation with final projects and reflections**|**Required for rigor.** Triangulation validates the findings from your primary data (micro-interactions) against secondary data (the final work and the metacognitive data). This specifically captures the **Integration** and **Reflection** stages of your framework.|Enhances the **credibility** and **depth** of your findings by converging evidence from multiple sources (Yin, 2018; Tellis, 1997).|
|**Students participated as co-investigators, not subjects.**|**High Impact.** This signals adherence to **ethical and reflexive considerations** (Creswell, 2013) and aligns with participatory research models, enriching the analysis by valuing the students' **local knowledge** and interpretations.|Addresses potential researcher bias and promotes **inclusivity**, strengthening the philosophical underpinnings of your qualitative study (Naeem & Thomas, 2025).|
