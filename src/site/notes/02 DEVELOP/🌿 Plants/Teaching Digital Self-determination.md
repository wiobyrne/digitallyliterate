# Teaching Digital Self-determination

*Tool migration as transformative curriculum*

> Tool migration from surveillance platforms to privacy-respecting alternatives becomes powerful curriculum when approached through critical digital pedagogy.

---

## The Transformation Opportunity

Rather than viewing platform transition as a technical burden, we can transform it into **learning experiences** that build both technical skills and critical consciousness about technology's social and political dimensions.

---

## Beyond Technical Training

Traditional technology training focuses on **how** to use tools. Critical digital pedagogy asks:

- **Why** do these tools exist?
- **Who** benefits from different technological choices?
- **How** do platforms shape our relationships and communities?
- **What** alternatives embody our values?

---

## Tool Choice as Values Expression

Every platform decision teaches about:

| Contrast | What It Teaches |
|----------|-----------------|
| Surveillance capitalism vs. Cooperative ownership | Business models and data |
| Centralized control vs. Federated autonomy | Power structures |
| Data extraction vs. Digital sovereignty | Who controls your information |
| Individual privacy vs. Collective security | Community responsibility |

---

## Scaffolding for Diverse Technical Levels

### Tiered Instruction Model

#### Core Champions (40-hour intensive)
**Who:** 3-5 community members with high technical motivation

**Focus:**
- Advanced encryption and security concepts
- Server administration and maintenance
- Community support and training delivery
- Cooperative governance through technical infrastructure

#### Power Users (16-hour workshops + mentoring)
**Who:** 15-20 members with moderate technical comfort

**Focus:**
- Platform customization and optimization
- Backup and security best practices
- Mentoring skills for supporting others
- Integration between different privacy tools

#### General Users (4-hour introduction + ongoing support)
**Who:** All community members

**Focus:**
- Basic platform navigation and collaboration
- Understanding privacy and security concepts
- Appreciation for cooperative digital infrastructure
- Confidence to explore advanced features independently

---

## Progressive Complexity Introduction

1. **Start with familiar interfaces** — CryptPad looks like Google Docs
2. **Add privacy features gradually** — encryption, secure sharing
3. **Introduce governance concepts** — federated vs. centralized
4. **Explore advanced customization** — self-hosting, community administration

---

## Learning Through Migration

### Authentic Assessment Opportunities

**Portfolio Documentation:**
- Decision-making processes comparing platform options
- Technical challenges and problem-solving strategies
- Community impact analysis of different tool choices
- Values reflection on alignment between tools and mission

**Peer Teaching Projects:**
- Creating tutorials for community members
- Leading workshops on privacy concepts
- Mentoring peers through technical transitions
- Facilitating discussions about digital sovereignty

**Real-World Application:**
- Migrating actual documents from Google Drive to CryptPad
- Setting up secure communications for sensitive project work
- Participating in governance of community infrastructure
- Contributing to tool evaluation and decision-making

---

## Concepts Learned Through Practice

### Encryption and Privacy
- **Zero-knowledge architecture** experienced through CryptPad use
- **End-to-end encryption** practiced in Matrix/Signal adoption
- **Threat modeling** developed through community security planning

### Decentralization and Federation
- **Federated networks** explored through Matrix server choices
- **Distributed governance** practiced through cooperative hosting decisions
- **Interoperability** demonstrated through cross-platform bridges

### Cooperative Economics
- **Shared ownership models** experienced through infrastructure funding
- **Democratic decision-making** practiced in tool selection processes
- **Mutual aid** through technical support based on ability and need

---

## Multi-Modal Learning Approaches

### Visual Learners
- Video tutorials with screen recording
- Infographic comparisons of platforms
- Interactive diagrams showing encryption and federation

### Hands-On Learners
- Sandbox environments for safe experimentation
- Guided practice with real community projects
- Troubleshooting workshops building confidence

### Conceptual Learners
- Discussion circles exploring values and implications
- Case study analysis of other communities' tool choices
- Policy development for community technology governance

---

## Harm Reduction Pedagogy

### Acknowledging Imperfection
- **No perfect tools exist** — all involve trade-offs
- **Incremental improvement** is better than paralysis
- **Community needs** sometimes require pragmatic choices
- **Learning process** includes making mistakes

### Sustainable Practice
- Avoiding burnout from constant platform vigilance
- Building capacity gradually rather than overwhelming
- Celebrating progress in the digital sovereignty journey
- Maintaining connections during transitions

---

## Assessment: Community-Centered Metrics

Rather than individual test scores, success measured through:

- **Collective capacity** for managing digital infrastructure
- **Community resilience** during technical challenges
- **Democratic participation** in technology governance
- **Values alignment** between stated principles and daily practices
