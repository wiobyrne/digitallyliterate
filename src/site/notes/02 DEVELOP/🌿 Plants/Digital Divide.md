# Digital Divide

## **Definition**  
The digital divide refers to the gap between those who have access to modern information and communication technologies (ICT) and those who do not.

## **Explain Like I'm 5**  
Imagine if some of your friends have toys to play with, but others don't. The digital divide is like some people having cool gadgets like tablets or computers to learn and play on, while others don't have them.

## **Digging Deeper**
The digital divide can be caused by various factors such as economic disparities, geographical location, education levels, and cultural barriers. It can result in unequal opportunities for education, employment, healthcare, and social interaction. For example, students without internet access at home may struggle to complete online assignments compared to those with high-speed internet.

## **Applications**  
- Education: The digital divide affects students' ability to access online resources for learning.
- Healthcare: Lack of access to telemedicine services due to the digital divide can impact healthcare outcomes.
- Economic Development: Disparities in technology access can hinder economic growth in underserved communities.
- Social Inclusion: Those without internet access may miss out on social connections and opportunities available online.
