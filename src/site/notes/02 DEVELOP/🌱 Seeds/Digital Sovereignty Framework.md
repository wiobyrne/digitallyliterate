# Digital Sovereignty Framework

*Taking back control of your digital life*

> Our goal is to empower everyday people and communities to take back control of their digital lives.

---

## Core Principles (Plain English)

### Privacy by Design
Building and using tools that **protect your data by default**. Privacy isn't an afterthought—it's baked in from the start.

In practice: Choose apps that minimize data collection and use strong encryption automatically. *You* decide who sees your information, not the platform.

### Data/Digital Sovereignty
Having **control over your own digital data and how it's used**.

Think of it like owning your home instead of renting. You're not stuck with a "landlord" (big company) who can change the rules. You and your community choose services that serve *your* interests.

### Digital Resilience
The ability to **keep digital systems running smoothly even when things go wrong**.

Building redundancy, independence, and adaptability into your digital life so you can keep communicating and organizing even when platforms fail.

## Why This Matters

Most of us rely on big tech platforms that make money from our data (*surveillance capitalism*). This leaves us feeling exposed and powerless.

**The alternative:** Tools and approaches that put privacy, community control, and resilience first. By understanding a few core concepts, we can make smarter choices that protect our personal and community information.

## Framing: Not Activism, Community

This work is framed around:
- **Community and organizing** — not activism labels
- **Empowerment** — giving people skills and tools
- **Values-driven** — rooted in cooperation and justice

---

## Hub Structure

A wiki-based approach with:
- **Landing page** — Overview of digital sovereignty
- **Subfolders** — Tool-specific guides (Signal, Proton, etc.)
- **Audit trail** — Track changes and reasoning over time
- **Accessible language** — Written for non-technical users

---

## The WHY

Each recommendation should explain:
1. What the tool/practice does
2. Why it matters for sovereignty
3. What risks it mitigates
4. How to get started
