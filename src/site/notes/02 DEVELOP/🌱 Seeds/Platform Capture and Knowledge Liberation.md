# Platform Capture and Knowledge Liberation

*When knowledge gets trapped — and how to free it*

> I didn't have a knowledge base. I had a stream.

## The Problem: When Knowledge Gets Trapped

Over the years, content lives on platforms like MailChimp, WordPress, and proprietary systems. Each one was convenient at the time—and each one quietly boxed the work in.

**Technically, the content was mine. Practically, it wasn't.**

It lived inside systems I didn't control, locked into formats that didn't talk to each other. Old ideas sank out of sight. New ones piled on top. Nothing connected.

---

## Streams vs. Webs

**Newsletters are great** at delivering ideas *in the moment*.

**Newsletters are terrible** at helping ideas grow over time.

The limitation:
- Can't easily link themes across years
- Can't surface recurring ideas
- Can't build explainers connecting insights from 2018 to 2024

**The need:** Transform the stream into a **web** — explorable spaces where knowledge accumulates and connections become visible.

---

## The Vision: A Personal Wiki

For years, the question kept coming:
> "Have you ever thought about building your own wiki?"

The realization: What if the newsletter was just one input?

**The integrated knowledge space:**
- Newsletter archives
- Blog posts
- Reading notes
- Presentation materials
- Half-formed ideas and connections

Show not just polished outputs, but the thinking process — how dots get connected.

## The Technical Liberation

### Step 1: Extract Everything
Download every archive from proprietary platforms — years of work trapped in HTML emails and databases.

### Step 2: Convert to Markdown
Plain text is the closest thing to a format that will outlast any platform:
- Human-readable without special software
- Versionable in Git
- Portable across any system

**When platforms die—and they will—plain text survives.**

### Step 3: Build the Garden
Digital gardens offer a different model:
- Not chronological feeds that bury yesterday's insights
- Explorable spaces where knowledge accumulates
- Connections become visible

As Tom Critchlow put it: *streams are fleeting, gardens are topology.*

## An Alternative to AI Slop

In a moment flooded with AI-generated content:
- Perfectly smooth
- Perfectly forgettable
- Disconnected from any real thinking process

A personal wiki is an **interesting alternative** — showing how a real human connected real dots over real time.
