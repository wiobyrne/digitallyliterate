# Computational Thinking as Communication

*From code to conversation in K-8 classrooms*

> AI-powered coding tools do not merely serve as neutral learning aids; rather, they mediate and transform language use, meaning-making, and social interactions.

---

## The Core Argument

As AI becomes embedded in K-8 learning environments through coding platforms, generative tools, and computational thinking (CT) frameworks, traditional conceptions of communication—primarily human, linear, and linguistic—are being redefined.

**CT and AI integration transform not just how students learn to code, but how they learn to communicate**—both with machines and with each other.

---

## Key Concepts

### AI Prompting as Communicative Act
In environments where students co-create with LLMs or generative agents, prompts function as:
- Iterative, audience-aware messages
- Drawing on decomposition, pattern recognition, and algorithmic logic
- Dialogic, metacommunicative processes

Students use natural and structured language to "speak" to AI and interpret its responses.

### Collaborative Sense-Making with AI
Learners co-construct code, text, and meaning with AI, reshaping:
- Literate identity
- Agency
- Cognitive frameworks

### Educational Tools as Epistemic Mediators
AI tools shape cognitive and communicative development in fundamental ways. They're not neutral—they actively mediate how students think and express.

## New Discursive Patterns

CT encourages students to adopt patterns that reconfigure meaning-making:

| Pattern | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Conditional logic** | If-then reasoning in communication |
| **Algorithmic sequencing** | Step-by-step articulation |
| **Prompt engineering** | Crafting effective AI queries |
| **Debugging as dialogue** | Iterative refinement through feedback |

---

## Research Questions

1. How does AI redefine communication in educational settings?
2. How does AI function as both subject and mediator in human communication?
3. What does communication look like between humans and "communicative AI"?
4. How do algorithmic and computational literacies function as communicative practices?
5. How do children's use of logic and prompt design become forms of emergent metacommunication?

---

## Theoretical Frame

> Coding and computational thinking are semiotic and social acts.

Drawing from:
- Sociocultural theories of literacy
- Psychology of language
- Communication studies

This signals a shift from traditional, human-centered models to **hybrid human-AI dialogue** where meaning is co-constructed.

---

## Implications

For the study of language and social psychology:
- CT practices represent new communicative literacies
- AI tools reshape peer-to-peer talk and student-teacher dialogue
- The co-construction of knowledge happens in AI-mediated environments
