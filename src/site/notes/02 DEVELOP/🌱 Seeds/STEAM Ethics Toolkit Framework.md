# STEAM Ethics Toolkit Framework

*A multi-session framework for ethical inquiry in STEAM*

> Wicked problems have no clear solutions—only clumsy, interdisciplinary approaches.

---

## Overview

The STEAM Ethics Toolkit guides students through identifying, analyzing, and responding to ethical issues across Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics.

Students develop critical thinking skills while considering the societal impacts and ethical implications of innovations and research in STEAM fields.

---

## Learning Objectives

- Identify ethical considerations in STEAM disciplines
- Apply ethical frameworks to analyze complex problems
- Develop reasoned arguments about ethical issues
- Propose solutions that balance innovation with ethical responsibility
- Collaborate effectively on ethics-based discussions and projects

---

## Four Main Components

### 1. Ethical Awareness
Identifying ethical issues in STEAM contexts

### 2. Ethical Analysis
Applying frameworks to examine issues:
- Utilitarianism
- Justice
- Care ethics
- Virtue ethics

### 3. Ethical Argumentation
Developing and defending ethical positions

### 4. Ethical Action
Proposing solutions and responses

---

## Three-Step Process

### Step 1: Foundation and Framing
**Focus: Ethical Awareness**

- Define your wicked problem clearly
- Reflect on initial understanding and perspective
- Establish your starting point (the "reset" moment)
- Use initial quizzes to document baseline thinking

**Key Questions:**
- What are your current areas of strength as an educator or advocate?
- How have your personal experiences influenced the problem you selected?

### Step 2: Exploration and Reflection
**Focus: Ethical Analysis + Argumentation**

- Engage in research from multiple angles
- Explore ethical frameworks
- Reflect on process and intersections
- Connect to core concepts (PBL, CT, STEAM integration)

**Using Generative AI:**
- Ask AI to summarize findings
- Explore alternative viewpoints
- Brainstorm connections
- Document interactions and insights

### Step 3: Synthesis and Creation
**Focus: Ethical Action**

- Synthesize learning into a toolkit artifact
- Create infographic, slidedeck, video, or guide
- Present wicked problem and proposed approach
- Reflect on journey and growth

---

## Guiding Reflection Questions

**On the Wicked Problem:**
- What wicked problem did you choose?
- In what ways is it complex or interconnected?
- Who is affected? Who benefits from the status quo?

**On STEAM Integration:**
- Which STEAM disciplines helped you make sense of the problem?
- How did you incorporate the arts or humanities?

**On Ethics:**
- What unintended consequences might come from your ideas?
- How are you planning to address these ethically?

**On AI Use:**
- How did generative AI tools shape your thinking?
- What did they help you see differently?
- How did you maintain critical judgment?

## Wicked Problems: Key Readings

### "Wicked Problems and Clumsy Solutions" (Rayner, 2012)
Complex, interconnected societal issues with no clear solution require "clumsy solutions" combining multiple perspectives.

### Stanford d.school: "What is a Wicked Problem?"
Concrete examples in education, climate change, health disparities.
