# AI Boundary Work and Agency

*How humans negotiate their relationship with AI systems*

> Agency is defined by friction. They worked harder than the machine.

## The Core Framework

When pre-service teachers interact with AI tools like NotebookLM, two distinct interaction profiles emerge:

### The Orchestrator (High Agency)
The interaction log looks like a messy, circular **loop**:
- Prompt the AI
- Read the AI's response
- Pause and **refuse** it
- Re-prompt with constraints: "Don't just list facts. Capture the tone."

The Orchestrator engages in a **Correction Loop**. They treat AI not as an oracle, but as a junior analyst whose work needs to be checked, challenged, and often rejected. Their agency is defined by **friction**.

### The Outsourcer (High Delegation)
The interaction log looks like a straight, vertical **line**:
- Prompt: "Help me study."
- AI offers a structure
- Student accepts immediately

No deletions, no re-prompts, zero friction. **Gravity takes over.** The student delegated entirely.

## Key Concepts

### HITL as Interactional Form
Human-in-the-Loop becomes observable through:
- **Loop vs. Line** — circular revision vs. linear acceptance
- **Friction vs. Gravity** — effort vs. passive acceptance
- **Refusal vs. Acceptance** — critical engagement vs. delegation

### Agency as Behavioral, Not Dispositional
Agency isn't motivation or attitude. Agency is:
- **Interruptive** — stopping the flow
- **Evaluative** — assessing quality
- **Effortful** — working harder than the machine

### The New Literacy Move: Valuation
Beyond credibility and relevance, learners must assess:
- Depth
- Nuance
- Epistemic quality

## Implications for Education

The conceptual throughline for teaching AI literacy:

> **Agency → Boundary-work → Ethical reasoning**

This means helping learners:
1. Position AI within their workflow
2. Enact agency through friction
3. Negotiate ethical responsibilities

The goal: Design **"loops worth living in"** where AI amplifies rather than replaces human cognition.
