# HITL Pedagogy Toolkit

*Keeping humans at the center of AI-assisted learning*

> HITL isn't just a tool—it's a pedagogy.

---

## HITL Prompt Starters

Use these templates to guide students' interactions with AI tools:

### "Show me multiple perspectives on..."
Encourages critical comparison rather than a single answer.

### "What assumptions is this answer making?"
Promotes reflective questioning of AI bias and scope.

### "Here's what I'm trying to learn—what questions should I be asking?"
Shifts AI to cognitive amplifier, not oracle.

### "Summarize this like I'm five. Now summarize it for a policymaker."
Pushes for audience awareness and knowledge transformation.

### "Give me a rough draft, but flag anything ethically questionable."
Builds ethical reflection directly into AI responses.

## Student Activities for HITL Thinking

These exercises emphasize the loop—asking students to respond, revise, and reflect in ways that foreground their own agency.

### 1. AI Remix + Human Rewrite
1. Students ask AI to generate a response to a prompt
2. Annotate it: What's useful? What's wrong? What's missing?
3. Rewrite in their own voice or for a different audience

### 2. Human Edits, AI Learns
- Use iterative prompting to show how human feedback changes AI outputs
- Document each iteration
- Analyze how the AI "learned" from corrections

### 3. The Fact-Check Challenge
- AI generates content on a topic
- Students verify claims against primary sources
- Report discrepancies and hypothesize why they occurred

### 4. Ethical Audit
- Students review AI output for:
  - Bias
  - Missing perspectives
  - Potential harms
- Propose revisions that address concerns

## Classroom Practices

### Daily Loop Check
Start or end class with reflection:
- What did I ask AI to do today?
- What did I keep? What did I change?
- What did I learn about my own thinking?

### AI Collaboration Logs
Have students maintain running documentation:
- Prompts used
- AI responses received
- Human decisions made
- Reflections on the process

### Peer Review of AI Interactions
Students share their AI conversations and get feedback on:
- Quality of prompts
- Critical engagement with outputs
- Demonstration of agency

## The HITL Mindset

HITL isn't about:
- Slowing down progress
- Avoiding AI

HITL is about:
- Centering human judgment
- Fostering creativity and care
- Keeping humans in **relationship** with AI, not just in control
