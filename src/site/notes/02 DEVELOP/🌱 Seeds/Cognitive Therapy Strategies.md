# Cognitive Therapy Strategies

*Tools for managing thoughts and building mental resilience*

> Cognitive therapy strategies help us recognize, challenge, and reshape the thought patterns that influence our emotions and behaviors.

## The Five Core Strategies

### 1. Rational Self-Talk

**What it is:** Consciously directing your internal dialogue toward helpful, realistic thoughts.

**How to practice:**
- Notice negative self-talk when it arises
- Ask: "Is this thought helpful? Is it true?"
- Replace with a more balanced statement
- Practice daily, especially during stress

**Example:** Instead of "I'm going to fail," try "This is challenging, and I can work through it step by step."

---

### 2. Reality Testing

**What it is:** Distinguishing between thoughts and facts by examining evidence.

**How to practice:**
- Identify the thought causing distress
- Ask: "What evidence supports this? What contradicts it?"
- Consider alternative explanations
- Reach a more balanced conclusion

**Key question:** "Am I confusing a thought with a fact?"

---

### 3. Attention Training

**What it is:** Deliberately directing your focus away from unhelpful rumination toward present-moment awareness.

**How to practice:**
- Notice when you're caught in repetitive negative thinking
- Gently redirect attention to sensory experience (what you see, hear, feel)
- Practice brief attention shifts throughout the day
- Build capacity through regular mindfulness practice

---

### 4. Cognitive Challenging

**What it is:** Actively questioning and disputing unhelpful thought patterns.

**How to practice:**
- Identify the automatic negative thought
- Ask: "What's the worst that could happen? The best? The most likely?"
- Consider: "What would I tell a friend thinking this?"
- Generate alternative perspectives

**Common distortions to challenge:**
- All-or-nothing thinking
- Catastrophizing
- Mind reading
- Fortune telling

---

### 5. Cognitive Restructuring

**What it is:** Systematically identifying and changing cognitive distortions into more balanced thoughts.

**How to practice:**
- Keep a thought record (situation, thought, emotion, evidence, alternative)
- Identify patterns in your distortions
- Develop replacement thoughts that are realistic (not just positive)
- Practice until new patterns become automatic
