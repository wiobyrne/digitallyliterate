# Privacy is Power, Not Secrecy

> Privacy isn't about hiding something wrong. It's about control, consent, and creating the space to be fully yourself.

## The Core Insight

At its core, **privacy is about boundaries** — deciding what parts of your life are public and what stays personal. It's not about secrecy. It's about **being human**.

We know what happens in the bathroom, but we still close the door. That's privacy — not secrecy. You're not hiding anything sinister; you're simply protecting your dignity.

## Why It Matters Online

Because **information is influence**.

From shopping and reading the news to voting or using GPS, modern life runs on data. If others control your data, they can shape your choices. Protecting your privacy helps you retain autonomy.

Privacy is ultimately about human information, and this is important because we know that **human information confers power over human beings**. If we care about our ability to be authentic, fulfilled, and free humans, we have to care about the rules that apply to information about us.

## The Reframe

Instead of asking "What do you have to hide?" ask:

- **Who decides** what happens to my information?
- **Who benefits** from knowing my habits, location, and preferences?
- **What power** am I giving away by not caring?

## Key Principle

**Privacy is about power, and it matters that this power ends up in the right hands.**
