# 21st Century Educational Justice

*Educators in the Civil Rights Movement of the 21st Century*

> We don't claim the mantle of past civil rights leaders — but we are living through a pivotal civil rights struggle of our own era.

## The Central Analogy

**"If literacy tests once blocked access to democracy, today's digital inequities and educational censorship play the same role."**

---

## Why This Matters Now

Today's attacks on education mirror historical patterns of disenfranchisement:

- Defunding of equity programs
- Book bans targeting marginalized voices
- Algorithmic bias in EdTech
- School-to-prison pipeline 2.0 through digital surveillance
- Censorship of inclusive curricula

Educational justice isn't a metaphor. It's the frontline.

## From 20th Century to 21st Century

| 20th-Century Tactic | 21st-Century Parallel |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| **Freedom Schools** | Digital Freedom Schools: open, community-built curricula |
| **Sit-Ins and Protests** | Virtual sit-ins, coordinated online actions |
| **Citizenship Schools** | Critical Digital Literacy Workshops |
| **Churches & Community Centers** | Decentralized networks via encrypted platforms |

## Digital Inequity as Civil Rights Issue

Access to technology and critical digital skills remains unequal, disproportionately affecting marginalized groups.

**Beyond top-down models:** Traditional literacy programs often fail to address cultural contexts or systemic barriers. We must center communities as agents of change, building on educator-activists' legacy in civil rights movements.

---

## Core Questions

- How are educators adapting civil rights-era strategies for digital contexts?
- What models of organizing and resistance are emerging against modern educational attacks?
- How can decentralized communities protect vulnerable students and teachers?

## Movement Outputs

| Output | Purpose |
