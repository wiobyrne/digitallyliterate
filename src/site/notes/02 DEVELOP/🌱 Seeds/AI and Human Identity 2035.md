# AI and Human Identity 2035

*How AI might change what it means to be human*

> The essence of being human will depend on our ability to use AI as a tool for empowerment rather than a crutch.

## The Big Questions

1. **Will humans' deepening partnership with AI have changed being human for better or worse?**
2. **What is likely to be the impact of AI advances on the experience of being human?**
3. **How might expanding human-AI interactions affect what we view as "core human traits"?**

## The Optimistic View

By 2035, our daily lives will likely be deeply interwoven with AI, fostering opportunities:

| Domain | Potential Benefits |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Healthcare** | AI-driven diagnostics, personalized treatment |
| **Education** | Personalized learning experiences |
| **Governance** | More connected, inclusive society |
| **Accessibility** | Enhanced convenience for all |

AI can provide incredible opportunities for personalization and problem-solving.

## The Concerning View

This dependence may risk eroding critical aspects of humanity:

| Risk | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Personal agency** | Over-reliance on AI decisions |
| **Privacy** | Commodification of personal data |
| **Critical thinking** | Outsourcing judgment to algorithms |
| **Social bonds** | Technology mediating human connection |
| **Empathy** | Algorithmic interactions replacing human care |
| **Authenticity** | AI-generated content blurring genuine expression |

## Core Human Traits at Risk

As AI becomes adept at mimicking human behaviors, distinguishing between genuine human interaction and AI-generated responses may become challenging.

**Traits that need preservation:**
- Empathy
- Creativity
- Authenticity
- Critical thinking
- Collaboration
- Emotional intelligence

## The Path Forward

To preserve and enrich the human experience:

### Digital Literacy
Preparing individuals to critically engage with technology, prompting thoughtful examination of their own digital footprints.

### Ethical AI Practices
Ensuring AI serves as a tool for empowerment rather than a replacement for human judgment.

### Thoughtful Integration
Approaching AI as something that augments human potential without diminishing individuality or social bonds.

## The Key Insight

Being human in the future landscape will depend on our ability to:
- Use AI as a tool for empowerment, not a crutch
- Maintain agency over critical decisions
