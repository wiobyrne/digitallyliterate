# AI Ethics in Education Policy

*A framework for generative AI use in courses*

> This is a collaborative journey of exploration, reflection, and learning.

---

## Core Philosophy

In courses, we actively engage with generative AI tools—not only as optional aids, but as a central part of the learning experience.

We think *with and about* AI:
- How it works
- What it amplifies or obscures
- What it means for teaching and learning practices

---

## Foundation: Trust and Transparency

This approach is grounded in:
- **Trust** — believing students will engage ethically
- **Professionalism** — treating AI use as a skill to develop
- **Mutual respect** — open dialogue about challenges and insights

While institutional Honor Codes govern academic integrity, this policy focuses on something deeper: using AI **ethically, responsibly, and reflectively**.

---

## What This Means in Practice

### Encouraged
- Experiment with generative AI (ChatGPT, Claude, NotebookLM, etc.) as part of learning
- Use AI to draft, summarize, brainstorm, or review work

### Required
- **Disclose** when and how you use AI in assignments or projects
- **Reflect** on your experience with these tools

### Protected
- You will **not be penalized** for using AI as long as use is:
  - Transparent
  - Aligned with assignment goals
  - Reflective of your own thinking

### Expected
- Participate in discussions about broader implications of generative AI
- Consider impacts on education, equity, creativity, and knowledge production

## Research Questions

Key questions emerging from AI in education:

| Question | Focus |
|----------|-------|
| How do students feel about using AI-generated content in assignments? | Perceptions |
| Does using AI tools change how students understand plagiarism and originality? | Concepts |
| What do students think about the ethics of AI assistance? | Values |
| How do students maintain academic honesty when AI is involved? | Practice |

---

## The Bigger Picture

This isn't just about tools—it's about developing:
- **Judgment** — knowing when and how to use AI
- **Literacy** — understanding AI capabilities and limitations
- **Critical perspective** — navigating a rapidly evolving digital world

---

## Sample Policy Language

> In this course, we will actively engage with **generative AI tools**—not only as optional aids, but as a central part of our learning experience. Whether we're using these tools to brainstorm, write, design, or reflect, we'll also be thinking *with and about* AI.
>
> This approach is grounded in **trust, professionalism, and mutual respect**. I ask that you be open, honest, and transparent in how you use AI in your coursework, and that you reflect critically on its impacts.
>
> You are encouraged to experiment with generative AI as part of your learning process. You must disclose when and how you use AI. You will not be penalized for transparent, thoughtful use that reflects your own thinking.
>
> This is a **collaborative journey** of inquiry, and I look forward to learning with and from you.
