# Threat Modeling for Regular People

> You don't need to be a security expert. You just need to ask the right questions.

---

## What Is Threat Modeling?

Threat modeling is simply **thinking through who might want your data and why** — then making decisions about how to protect yourself.

It sounds technical, but you already do this in real life:
- You lock your car in some neighborhoods but not others
- You share your address with delivery services but not strangers
- You close the blinds at night but leave them open during the day

The same logic applies to your digital life.

## The Five Questions

Answer these to understand your personal threat model:

| Question | What It Means |
|----------|---------------|
| **What do I want to protect?** | Photos, messages, financial data, location, health info |
| **Who might want it?** | Advertisers, hackers, stalkers, employers, governments |
| **What happens if they get it?** | Embarrassment, financial loss, physical danger, discrimination |
| **How likely is that?** | Is this a realistic concern for your situation? |
| **What am I willing to do about it?** | Time, money, convenience trade-offs |

## Different People, Different Threats

Your threat model depends on who you are:

| Person | Primary Concerns | Focus Areas |
|--------|------------------|-------------|
| Average person | Data brokers, advertisers, hackers | Password hygiene, ad blocking, backups |
| Teacher | Student privacy, school surveillance | FERPA, data minimization |
| Journalist | Source protection, targeted attacks | Encrypted communication, OpSec |
| Activist | Government surveillance, doxxing | Anonymity tools, compartmentalization |
| Domestic abuse survivor | Stalker ex-partner | Device security, account separation |

**Most people** are mainly protecting against:
- Advertisers tracking behavior
- Hackers stealing credentials
- Data breaches exposing information
- Companies selling personal data

## The 80/20 of Privacy

You don't need to do everything. These basics protect against most threats:

1. **Use a password manager** — Unique passwords for every account
2. **Enable 2FA** — Especially on email and financial accounts
3. **Keep software updated** — Patches close security holes
4. **Think before clicking** — Phishing is the #1 attack vector
5. **Review app permissions** — Does that app really need your contacts?

---

## When to Do More

Consider stronger measures if:
- You have a public-facing role (journalist, activist, public figure)
- You're in a vulnerable situation (domestic abuse, targeted harassment)
- You handle sensitive information (healthcare, legal, research)
- You live under an authoritarian government
- You want to model good practices for others

---

## The Trade-Off Triangle

Every privacy decision balances three things:

```
     Security
        /\
       /  \
      /    \
     /______\
Convenience  Privacy
```

- **More secure** often means **less convenient**
- **More private** sometimes costs **time or money**
- **Perfect privacy** doesn't exist — aim for **good enough**

---

## Getting Started

1. **Answer the five questions** above for your own situation
2. **Pick one improvement** to make this week
3. **Don't try to do everything** — progress beats perfection
4. **Revisit periodically** — your situation changes over time
