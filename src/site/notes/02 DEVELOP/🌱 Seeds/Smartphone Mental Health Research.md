# Smartphone Mental Health Research

*Seed page growing from [[03 CREATE/ðŸ“§ Newsletter/DL 398\|DL 398]] commitment to dig deeper into longitudinal mental health data*

## Initial Research Thread

A [2025 study in the Journal of Human Development and Capabilities](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19452829.2025.2518313) from Sapien Labs found that among 100,000+ young adults (18-24), those who got smartphones younger experienced more suicidal ideation, aggression, reality detachment, and hallucinations.

**Key Finding**: First generation to grow up with smartphones shows measurable mental health impacts correlated with early adoption age.

## Questions to Explore

- How do these findings connect to broader screen time research?
- What are the policy implications for device access decisions?
- How do we design healthy relationships with powerful tools?
- What role do [[01 CONSUME/ðŸ“¥ Inbox/Digital Citizenship\|Digital Citizenship]] frameworks play in mitigation?

## Connections Developing

- Relates to family technology decision-making

## Research to Track

- Longitudinal studies following this cohort over time
- Policy responses in educational settings
- Intervention strategies showing effectiveness
- Cross-cultural variations in impact patterns
