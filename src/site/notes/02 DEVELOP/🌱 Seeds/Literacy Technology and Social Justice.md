# Literacy, Technology, and Social Justice

> Education is not a neutral space; it is a contested arena where the struggle for equal access, representation, and voice plays out.

## The Evolving Definition of Literacy

Literacy has evolved beyond reading and writing to encompass:

- Navigating digital media and platforms
- Critically engaging with information sources
- Understanding digital citizenship
- Participating in globally networked spaces

**Being literate today** means navigating a connected/contested space with awareness of its potential for both empowerment and harm.

## The Critical Lens

Digital literacy practices must be examined through lenses of:

| Dimension | Questions to Ask |
|-----------|------------------|
| **Power** | Who benefits? Who is harmed? |
| **Intersectionality** | How do race, gender, class affect access and experience? |
| **Equity** | Does this level the playing field or widen gaps? |
| **Access** | Who can participate? Who is excluded? |
| **Advocacy** | How can literacy become a force for change? |
| **Identity** | How does digital engagement shape sense of self? |
| **Mental Well-being** | What are the emotional costs of participation? |

## Avoiding Pitfalls

### The "White Savior" Complex
Digital spaces can perpetuate harmful narratives where privileged individuals "save" marginalized communities. Instead: **solidarity and allyship** — amplify marginalized voices, support rather than overshadow.

### Performative Activism
Engaging in social justice actions primarily to be seen, rather than for genuine change. Authentic digital literacy involves:
- Understanding root causes
- Engaging in critical dialogue
- Working toward change online *and* offline

### "Charging the Battery" (Dr. Bettina Love)
Before engaging in social justice work:
- Educate yourself
- Engage in self-reflection
- Develop deep understanding of issues
- Build mental and emotional preparedness

## The Cyberstander Problem

A **cyberstander** passively witnesses online harassment without intervening.

**Why it matters:**
- Normalizes harmful behavior
- Creates impunity for perpetrators
- Contradicts principles of digital citizenship

**The shift needed:** From passive observer to **active bystander** who takes action to prevent or address harm.

## Literacy Tomorrow

Being literate in the future extends beyond technical skills to include:

- Digital ethics
- Responsible information consumption
- Meaningful, empathetic dialogue
- Combating doxxing, harassment, and threats
- Creating inclusive (not hostile) digital environments

---

## Key Questions

- What does it mean to be literate in a globally networked world?
- How do you engage in literacy practices without creating hostile environments?
- How can digital literacy become a force for equity rather than oppression?
