# Irish Identity and Creative Expression

*Writing yourself into being through Irish mythology and landscape*

> Ancestral echoes weave through my soul, a saga of resilience, making me whole.

---

## The Concept

For pre-service teachers exploring identity, diversity, culture, and privilege, creative expression offers a powerful way to "write yourself into being."

This includes giving others a "walk into your world" to understand:
- Where you're coming from
- What your dreams are
- What setbacks you've had
- Where you want to go

Draw inspiration from Irish mythology or historical figures to explore how ancestral roots shape identity.

- Incorporate elements from Irish legends
- Explore struggles faced by past generations
- Write about the echoes of ancestors in your thoughts, dreams, and aspirations
- Include imagery from your own landscapes or mythology

### 2. Celtic Threads of Diversity
Incorporate Ireland's rich tapestry of cultures—Celtic, Viking, Norman influences.

- Reflect on how this diversity contributes to your own identity
- Weave together threads of diversity

### 3. The Emerald Mosaic
Imagine Ireland as a mosaic of cultures, traditions, and stories.

- Use Irish poetry or landscapes as metaphors for identity facets
- Explore how personal experiences contribute to this vibrant mosaic
- Allow others to walk through the colors and textures of your world

### 4. Beyond the Horizon
Look to Irish poets who explored dreams and aspirations.

## Pedagogical Approach

Encourage students to be:
- **Authentic** — true to their own experience
- **Vulnerable** — willing to share struggles
- **Reflective** — thinking deeply about identity

This exercise fosters deeper understanding of self and others, promoting empathy and connection.
