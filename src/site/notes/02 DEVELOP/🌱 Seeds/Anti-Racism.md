# Anti-Racism

## Quick Note
Anti-racism is the active process of identifying and opposing racism by changing systems, organizational structures, policies and practices, and personal attitudes and behaviors that perpetuate racial inequity. It goes beyond simply being "not racist" to actively working to dismantle racist systems and promote racial equity.

## Context
This concept is fundamental to understanding social justice work and creating meaningful change in educational institutions, organizations, and society. Anti-racism requires sustained commitment and action rather than passive non-participation in racist behaviors.

## Next Steps
- Explore specific anti-racist practices in education
- Research organizational anti-racism frameworks
- Connect with related concepts of systemic change and equity work
