# Surveillance and Data Ethics in Education

> Privacy isn't optional — and the quiet expansion of institutional data collection isn't neutral. It's about power.

## The Expanding Data Dragnet

Educational institutions are normalizing surveillance at every level:

- **K-12:** Student information systems, proctoring tools, bus scanners, AI analytics
- **Higher Ed:** Mobile credentials, faculty reporting platforms, learning management systems
- **Both:** Data collection often happens without meaningful consent or clear oversight

When a 5th grader needs to scan a card to get on and off the bus, we should ask: Where is that data going? Why is it being collected? How long is it stored?

---

## The Pattern

New data systems are typically justified with familiar language:
- Efficiency
- Safety
- Accountability
- "Fast-tracked" at student request

But these systems rarely stop where they start. Each new layer expands an infrastructure of surveillance that shapes how we study, teach, and are governed.

---

## The Real Stakes

**Privacy is about power** — who sees, stores, and interprets our data, and who decides how it's used.

History reminds us: when regimes change, so do the hands holding that data.

For marginalized students and colleagues — those already targeted by policing, immigration enforcement, or political repression — institutional data collection isn't neutral. It's dangerous.

**Every policy of "data sharing" today can become a data dragnet tomorrow.**

## Platform Capitalism in Academia

When faculty data moves into platforms like Interfolio (owned by Elsevier), consider:

- Faculty CVs become part of centralized, searchable, cloud-hosted databases
- The platform dictates how we represent our professional identities
- Academic labor feeds data infrastructures that benchmark, rank, and monetize output
- Governance is opaque — who can access your data? For what purpose?

---

## What Faculty Can Do

You don't need to become a privacy lawyer to care about this:

- **Ask questions before new systems are implemented:** Who requested this? What data is collected? Who has access, and for how long?
- **Insist on transparency:** Policies shouldn't be hidden from those they affect
- **Link privacy to pedagogy:** Treat data ethics as part of digital literacy, not IT compliance
- **Protect the vulnerable:** If surveillance harms even one group of students, it harms our mission
- **Maintain independence:** Keep ORCID profiles and personal websites alongside internal systems

## The Enshittification Problem

What we lose in the name of "better":
- Convenience comes at the cost of control
- Services degrade as surveillance expands
- Digital hygiene erodes when tracking is normalized
