# Progressive Summarization

## Summary
A note-taking technique developed by Forte Labs for creating discoverable and actionable notes through progressive layers of highlighting and summarization.

## Core Content

### The Technique
Progressive Summarization is a systematic approach to processing and organizing information for future retrieval. The method involves creating multiple layers of emphasis to highlight the most valuable insights within saved resources.

### Implementation Steps

#### 1. Create an Inbox System
Establish a dedicated inbox page as a parking spot for incoming notes and resources before they are processed and organized.

#### 2. Capture Raw Content
Dump incoming resources directly into the inbox without initial filtering or organization. This preserves the information while deferring processing decisions.

#### 3. First Layer: Bold the Best Parts
Read through saved resources and **bold the most valuable and relevant sections**. This creates the first layer of emphasis for future reference.

#### 4. Second Layer: Highlight Top Selections
From the bolded sections, ==highlight only the most significant insights and actionable information==. This creates a concentrated essence of the resource.

#### 5. Third Layer: Executive Summary
For the most significant and insightful resources, write a brief executive summary at the top of the page. This provides instant access to key takeaways without re-reading the entire resource.

#### 6. Project Integration
When working on specific projects, create linked databases with appropriate filters to surface only relevant resources. This maintains separation while enabling focused access to pertinent information.

### Benefits
- **Faster Information Retrieval**: Multiple layers of emphasis enable quick location of key insights
- **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Systematic processing prevents information overload
- **Improved Discoverability**: Progressive filtering makes valuable information more accessible
- **Project Alignment**: Filtering capabilities connect resources to specific work streams

## Applications
