# Digital Overwhelm

*Seed page for future development - "At some point, I might be able to share that story"*

## From DL 398

"Behind every silence is a story. At some point, I might be able to share that story."

The year-long newsletter hiatus wasn't just scheduling - it was a form of ghosting driven by avoidance and self-preservation.

## Themes to Explore (When Ready)

### **Digital Performativity Fatigue**
- When everything online feels performative
- Silence as the only authentic response
- The exhaustion of maintaining digital presence

### **System Overwhelm Patterns**
- Personal experience mirroring broader communication breakdown
- How individual burnout reflects systemic issues
- Connection to whale communication patterns and brain opacity

### **Recovery and Return**
- What makes authentic re-engagement possible
- Role of digital garden in reducing performative pressure
- Creating sustainable approaches to public thinking
