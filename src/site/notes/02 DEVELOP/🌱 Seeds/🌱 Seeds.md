# Seed Notes

Seeds are the earliest stage of a note in this garden. They're fragments, questions, provocations, and half-formed ideas — captured so they don't get lost, waiting to be developed.

Some seeds will grow into plants and eventually evergreens. Some will stay seeds forever. That's fine — not every idea needs to become an essay.

## What seeds look like

- A question worth exploring
- A connection between two ideas
- A quote or concept that stopped me
- A rough outline of something I want to write

## Why publish seeds?

Working in the open means sharing the messy middle, not just the polished result. Seeds show how ideas start.
