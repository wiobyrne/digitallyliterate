# Privacy, Security, and Encryption Defined

> Three words you've heard thrown around — they're related, but not the same.

---

## The House Metaphor

Think about your home:

| Concept | Metaphor | What It Does |
|---------|----------|--------------|
| **Privacy** | Closing the curtains | Controls who sees your data |
| **Security** | Locking the doors and windows | Protects against unauthorized access |
| **Encryption** | The safe inside the house | Makes data unreadable without the key |

---

## Privacy: Closing the Curtains

**Privacy** is like closing the curtains on your windows. You're not hiding anything illegal or shameful — you just don't want strangers peeking in while you cook dinner or binge your favorite show in pajamas.

In the digital world, privacy means **you control who can see** your data, location, messages, and habits. It's about **consent and boundaries** — not secrecy.

**Try This:**
- Review app permissions — disable access to camera, contacts, or microphone unless necessary
- Limit social sharing — think twice before posting real-time locations
- Use privacy-focused tools — Firefox, Brave, Signal

## Security: Locking the Doors and Windows

If privacy is closing the curtains, **security** is locking the doors and windows. You're trying to keep bad actors out — whether they're burglars in real life or hackers online.

Security is about **protection**. It's firewalls, passwords, two-factor authentication, and software updates.

**Try This:**
- Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) — a quick win for account security
- Use strong, unique passwords — or let a password manager handle them
- Update software regularly — patches close holes that attackers exploit
- Stay alert for phishing — don't click suspicious links

## Encryption: The Safe Inside the House

Now imagine you have a safe where you keep your most valuable things — birth certificates, passports, that awkward photo from prom. Even if someone broke in, they wouldn't be able to read what's inside without the key.

That's **encryption** — it scrambles your data so only the people who are meant to see it can make sense of it. Even if someone intercepts it, it's useless without the key.

**Try This:**
- Use end-to-end encrypted apps — Signal, WhatsApp (for messages)
- Look for HTTPS — the padlock in your browser
- Consider Cryptomator — encrypts files before cloud upload

## How They Work Together

| Layer | Question It Answers |
|-------|---------------------|
| Privacy | Who *should* see my data? |
| Security | Who *can* access my data? |
| Encryption | Can anyone *read* my data if intercepted? |

The sweet spot is when all three overlap. But sometimes you have to compromise — and that's where [[threat modeling\|threat modeling]] comes in.

## The Culture Shift

We need to **normalize privacy and security culture** — not just trust what developers and organizations are offering.

We lock our doors without thinking. We close our curtains without guilt. We should approach our digital lives the same way.
