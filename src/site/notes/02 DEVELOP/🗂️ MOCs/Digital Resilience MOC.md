# Digital Resilience MOC

Welcome to the **Digital Resilience Map of Content**, a curated guide to key concepts, practices, and tensions that shape how we sustain privacy, safety, and agency in the digital age.

Digital resilience includes the technical, emotional, and ethical capacities to engage meaningfully and mindfully with digital technologies—especially amid surveillance, misinformation, algorithmic bias, and emerging threats.

This index will grow as I explore, test, and review them over time. Each entry will eventually include a description, key features, and notes from personal use.
