# Emotional Intelligence MOC

Welcome to the **Emotional Intelligence Map of Content**, a curated guide to key concepts, practices, and frameworks that shape how we work, learn, and collaborate with emotional wisdom and human-centered approaches.

Emotional intelligence encompasses not just individual emotional awareness, but the creation of systems, workflows, and cultures that honor human complexity while enabling meaningful work and authentic connection. This goes beyond "soft skills" to become fundamental infrastructure for sustainable, innovative, and justice-oriented collaboration.
