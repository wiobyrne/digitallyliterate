- **Quality over quantity** in all educational offerings
- **Authentic positioning** - no "guru" or overhyped approaches
- **Democratic learning** - minimizing power differentials between teacher and student
- **Intellectual humility** - accepting that beliefs may not always be correct
- **Student empowerment** over teacher authority/indoctrination
