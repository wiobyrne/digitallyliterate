# Why Signal is more private and secure than iMessage and SMS
## Brief Summary
This video by Sun Knudsen explores the privacy and security advantages of Signal over iMessage and SMS. It highlights the technical implementations that contribute to Signal's superior protection against interception and data collection.

## Key Takeaways
- **End-to-End Encryption:** Signal employs robust end-to-end encryption, ensuring that only the sender and recipient can access the messages.
- **Minimal Data Retention:** Unlike iMessage and SMS, Signal retains minimal user data, reducing the risk of exposure in case of breaches.
- **Open Source Transparency:** Signal's open-source nature allows for independent audits and builds trust in its security claims.
