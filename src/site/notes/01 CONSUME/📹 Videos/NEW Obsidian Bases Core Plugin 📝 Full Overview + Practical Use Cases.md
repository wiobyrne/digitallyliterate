Obsidian Bases effortlessly turns your notes into a database, without the need of plugins like Dataview or cloud-based apps like Notion. If you've been waiting to switch to Obsidian from Notion, now might be the time!
> 
> Bases makes the properties of your notes FAR more powerful. You can now edit properties from within the table directly, simplifying batch editing of your note metadata. 
> 
> Converting your notes into databases can help you surface insights and reduce information overload, as building inboxes and locating patterns becomes significantly easier.
> 
> If you've struggled with the Dataview plugin or Notion in the past, I think you'll really enjoy this update. You no longer need to learn to code in Dataview in order to build inboxes & indexes for your notes.
> 
> Note: this feature is currently available in beta to Catalyst members (early access). I will let you know when the feature becomes available to everyone. In the meantime, this tutorial will still help you understand how you will be able to incorporate Bases into your note-taking workflow once you get access.
