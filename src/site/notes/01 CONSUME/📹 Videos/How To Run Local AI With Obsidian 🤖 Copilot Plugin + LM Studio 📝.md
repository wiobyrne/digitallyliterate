> [!info]- Description
> Hi Friends, my name is Callum aka wanderloots. In today's video, I walk through How To Run Local AI (LLM & Text Embedding) In Obsidian with LM Studio (or Ollama). This method is Free, Private, & Local üìùüí°I also compare the Smart Connections Plugin & the Obsidian Copilot Plugin. I was surprised how they each work better in different ways!
> 
> The Copilot Plugin is a free & private AI tool that ~can~ operate locally within Obsidian, with various features that leverage your existing note-taking through a local embeddings model
> 
> The Smart Connections Plugin is also a free & private AI tool that operates 100% locally.
> 
> New ideas, surfacing insights, making connections, distilling complex information, there is no end to how AI can boost the notes you're already taking ‚ú®
> 
> One of the main reasons I use Obsidian for my note-taking is that it operates in markdown, producing a future-proof intellectual property asset that can connect seamlessly with AI tools.
> 
> It's truly an incredible way to take your static notes in obsidian and turn them into dynamic knowledge, while retaining the authenticity of your own writing to work WITH AI, rather than replace your thinking/writing.
