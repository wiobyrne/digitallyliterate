# Sci-Fi Short Film “Slaughterbots”  DUST
## Brief Summary
The short film "Slaughterbots," directed by Stewart Sugg and presented by DUST, explores a dystopian future where autonomous drone weaponry has been developed. The film begins with a corporate presentation that shifts from seemingly harmless drone technology to a chilling demonstration of how these drones can execute individuals based on programmed profiles. It critiques the normalization of lethal technology and the ethical implications of such advancements.

## Key Takeaways
- **Normalization of Violence**: The film illustrates how advanced technology can desensitize individuals to violence, as the audience reacts to the drone demonstration with applause.
- **Autonomous Decision-Making**: It raises concerns about allowing machines to make life-and-death decisions based on algorithms and profiling.
- **Dangers of AI Weaponry**: The portrayal of drones that can identify targets autonomously highlights the potential for misuse and moral dilemmas in warfare and policing.

> [!quote] Summary
> The video "Slaughterbots" presents a dystopian scenario where autonomous drones are used as weapons, capable of making lethal decisions based on user-defined profiles. It critiques the ethical implications of AI in warfare, showcasing a corporate presentation that reveals how easily society could accept such technology as normal.

> [!info]- Description
> In a dystopian world a new form of A.I. weaponry has been created. All these drone bots need is a profile: age, sex, fitness, uniform, and ethnicity. Nuclear is obsolete. Take out your entire enemy virtually risk free. Just characterize him, release the swarm, and rest easy.

> The 7 minute film opens with a Silicon Valley CEO-type delivering a product presentation to a live audience a la Steve Jobs. The presentation seems innocuous enough at first—the presenter seems to be unveiling some new drone technology—but takes a dark turn when he demonstrates how these autonomous drones can slaughter humans like cattle by delivering “a shaped explosive” to the skull.The audience eats it up, clapping and laughing along with the CEO as if they hadn’t witnessed anything more dangerous than the unveiling of the iPhone X. The CEO goes further, showing videos of the tiny killer drone in action. “Let’s watch what happens when the weapons make the decisions,” the CEO says, as the bot executes a number of people on the massive screen behind him. “Now trust me, these are all bad guys.” What follows is a deeply unsettling portrait of a dystopian world where these small weaponised drones use their onboard technologies—“cameras like you use for your social media apps, facial recognition like you have on your phones!”—to make autonomous decisions about who lives and who dies.
