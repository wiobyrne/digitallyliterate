> Greg Baugues showcases how to use Claude AI with Obsidian to improve writing speed and efficiency, detailing his process of dictating, updating, and editing notes in a streamlined workflow.

> [!info]- Description
> If you give Claude Desktop access to the Filesystem MCP server, it can now read and write to your Obsidian Vault. If you pair this with SuperWhisper, this means you can now use Claude as a writing agent to help you write Obsidian notes. In this video, I walk through my process for dictating responses via SuperWhisper to Claude, having Claude update Obsidian via MCP, and then having Claude edit my words, and finally, after Claude was done, doing an ol' fashioned editing pass. This helped me knock out an interview and write about 2000 words in 90 minutes.
