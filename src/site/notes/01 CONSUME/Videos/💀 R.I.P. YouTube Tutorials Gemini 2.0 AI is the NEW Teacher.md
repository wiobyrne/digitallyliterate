confusing instructions and no one to answer your questions but what if there was a better

  0: 14

way hi I'm Jamie and welcome to teachers Tech I'm kind of putting myself out of a job here

  0: 22

today on YouTube for what I'm showing you for the last N9 years I've created how to tutorials

  0: 28

on software but I'm going to show you how AI will probably take this over and I'll have to be ready

  0: 34

to Pivot to something else on YouTube if I'm going to stay on it because AI will be able to teach you

  0: 41

any software you want on your computer and it will expand from there so I'm going to be showing you

  0: 47

how to use Google AI Studio this is completely for free and you can log in and get access to this and

  0: 54

I'll show you that and then I'm going to show you how it can teach you something and I'm going to

  0: 58

use Microsoft Excel as an example of how to teach me how to use pivot tables we're going to be using

  1: 05

Google AI Studio here today I'll put the link Down Below in the description so you can click on

  1: 09

it come to here completely free the way I'm using it you just have to accept the terms when you get

  1: 16

to this we're going to be looking at the stream real time I have a different video where I talk

  1: 21

about the create the prompt if you want to check that out too but I'm going to go to stream real

  1: 27

time and we're going to be taking a look at the share your screen option so I can see everything

  1: 31

on your screen and I'll just take a quick look at show Gemini to show how it can see you as

  1: 37

well let's get started I have Microsoft Excel open here and I just have some random data of

  1: 44

this these ice cream sales here I'm going to have a conversation with Gemini to walk me through how

  1: 50

to create a pivot table so this is something I've created videos on before but is this something

  1: 56

that you could see that if you had this ability you wouldn't go to a YouTube channel to try to do

  2: 01

it you just would have the conversation with your AI on the computer so I'm going to go ahead and

  2: 07

I'm just going to click on this screen here I'm already logged into uh the Google AI Studio you

  2: 14

can see I'm under flash to experimental Gemini 2.0 you need to be in the multimodal and the

  2: 20

output is going to be audio and you can change the different voices here I'm just going to leave it

  2: 24

with this one here and I'm not going to change anything else I'm going to go ahead and share

  2: 30

my screen here so as soon as I do this and it's already hearing me you can hear me right can you

  2: 35

what do you see right now yes I can hear you I am currently seeing a blank screen oh that's

  2: 42

because I haven't shared it yet I'm going to share this window right here what do you see

  2: 48

now I now see an Excel spreadsheet titled Ice Cream sales xlsx okay it appears to contain data

  3: 00

yeah that's that is what it is so what let's say my boss gave me this and he

  3: 05

wants me to create this pivot table I have no idea how to create pivot

  3: 09

tables and I need some help from you can you explain me how to do this uh how to

  3: 13

do this step by step and don't go too fast please and keep it simple so I can

  3: 17

understand okay I understand you'd like help creating a pivot table with this

  3: 23

data step by step and keeping it simple let's start with the

  3: 27

basics first click anywhere within your data table right here is that

  3: 34

good yes that works perfectly now go to the insert tab on the ribbon at the top

  3: 41

of the Excel Window okay I found insert I clicked it great now in the top left corner

  3: 51

of the ribbon you should see a pivot table button yes you should have a little table

  3: 55

icon next to yeah okay go ahead and click that pivot table button oh yeah I see it something

  4: 01

happened okay a window should have popped up it's titled create pivot table can you see that

  4: 09

window yeah I have the pivot table it says pivot tap from range table or

  4: 17

range that's correct it should show your data range in the table SL range box now

  4: 25

below you'll see two radio buttons one says new worksheet and the other other

  4: 29

says existing worksheet for this example let's select new worksheet okay that's

  4: 36

selected excellent now click okay at the bottom of the create pivot table window

  4: 45

okay I hit okay I don't see anything I just see this pivot table 4 thing over

  4: 50

here okay you should also see a pivot table Fields pane on the right side of your screen

  4: 58

can you confirm that you can see that pain with the list of fields yes I see that okay

  5: 05

perfect now to build a basic pivot table let's start by clicking the check box next

  5: 10

to region in that pivot table Fields pane oh I checked it y great you should now see the

  5: 19

different regions listed in the rows of the pivot table now let's also click the

  5: 22

check box next to total sales to see the sum of sales for each region okay I click

  5: 30

that now you have a basic pivot table showing the total sales for each region is this what

  5: 37

you were looking for yeah I what do I do with these other I have columns and filters what do

  5: 42

I do with there great question you can use the columns and filters areas to further organize

  5: 50

and analyze your data for example if you drag the flavor field to the columns area your pivot table

  5: 56

would show a column for each flavor breaking down the sales in each region by Flavor oh yeah

  6: 01

you want to try that or do you I did try that that I see what happened there you know my boss

  6: 05

did want to know kind of BU each salesperson to know you know to be able to look how could I do

  6: 12

that okay to see sales by salesperson you can drag the salesperson field from the pivot table Fields

  6: 21

list to the Rose area and place it above the region field this will Nest salespersons within

  6: 26

each region oh okay I see what do I do with filters great you should to use filters you

  6: 36

can drag a field like flavor to the filters area then above your pivot table you'll see

  6: 41

a drop- down where you can select specific flavors to include in your report okay this

  6: 47

drop down over here exactly you can use that drop down to filter the data in the pivot table based

  6: 55

on the flavor selected does this make sense yes okay I think my boss might like that well thank

  7: 01

you for your help do you think here's a non- Exel question do you think as this progresses

  7: 07

this type of Technology do you see with the glasses that are going to come out with what

  7: 11

Google creates will you just be able to look at anything and be able to offer this type of

  7: 16

help that's an interesting question about future technology as a language model I don't have the

  7: 23

ability to see or interact with the world like a person wearing smart glasses however it's

  7: 28

certainly possible that future iterations of technology could allow me to assist users with

  7: 33

real-time data analysis by seeing what they see all right I'm going to stop sharing now

  7: 41

and I just want sounds I just wanted to show everybody here that everything is recorded in

  7: 47

the Stream real time but it doesn't get saved here yet so everything you can download these

  7: 54

different uh conversations and there's different playback speeds if you want to uh review it

  7: 59

any of this so that's just an example of Gemini reading my computer screen but it can do more than

  8: 06

that as this advances let me give you a demo of this right here show Gemini so even if I

  8: 12

was writing something down on a piece of paper it will be able to see it when I go ahead and

  8: 18

click show Gemini you can see there I am Gemini sees me you see me right okay I see the man in

  8: 25

the video he's looking directly at the camera what am I wearing you are wearing a dark gray

  8: 34

collared shirt is there anything else you would like to know yeah what am I holding up right now

  8: 41

you are holding up a white piece of paper that has 5 \* 3 = 12 written on it is this correct

  8: 47

would you like to ask me no that is not correct 5 \* 3 = 15 not 12 would you like me to help you

  8: 54

with more math no I just want H to explain people all the different cap abilities that you have so

  9: 01

not only when I shared my screen did it help me I could be writing paper down on paper and if the

  9: 07

camera is seeing me it will be able to help me right there going back to what I mentioned about

  9: 12

the glasses before when the glasses come out it will be able to help you in many different

  9: 18

situations so what do you think about this is this the end of howto videos on YouTube should I start

  9: 24

looking for a different type of YouTube channel is this something a way that you would like

  9: 29

to learn I see as this progresses I would probably learn like this if I can get instant feedback

  9: 34

looking at the data that I have on my screen if it can walk me through like this and it's

  9: 38

going to only get better so I would also think AI agents would help fill in the information if

  9: 44

I want to data in the Excel spreadsheet will manipulate things like that lots of things

  9: 50

are going to happen i' really like to know your thoughts on it down below in the comments thanks

  9: 55
