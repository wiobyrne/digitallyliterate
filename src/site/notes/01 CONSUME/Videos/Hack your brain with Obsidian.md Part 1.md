# Hack your brain with Obsidian.md Part 1

![Hack your brain with Obsidian.md [Part 1]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbsAQSIKQXk?list=WL)

## Description

(Part 2: https://youtu.be/uPVs40agwkw)
I have used many note-taking tools over the years, simple-note, notion, and extensively emacs org-mode, none have improved my thinking in the way that Obsidian has.
Today is a deep-dive into my second brain, and if you take my advice, YOUR second brain.

## Notes

## Transcript

## Intro

0:00

hi friends my name is Tris and this is

0:02

no boilerplate focusing on Fast

0:03

technical videos I have used many

0:05

note-taking tools over the years simple

0:07

note notion and extensively emacs org

0:10

mode none have improved my thinking in

0:11

the way obsidian has today is a deep

0:14

dive into my second brain and if you

0:15

take my advice your second brain too

## My workflow

0:18

everything you see in this video from

0:19

the script to the images are part of a

0:21

markdown obsidian document available on

0:23

GitHub under a public domain license as

0:25

I mentioned in my coping mechanisms

0:27

video I have built my whole workflow for

0:29

life around obsidian I used to use emacs

0:32

org mode and actually for a certain kind

0:33

of delicate nerd I recommend it more

0:35

highly than obsidian I wrote the first

0:37

year and a half of my sci-fi podcast

0:38

lost terminal using org mode and it's

0:40

really great try space max if you want

0:43

to give it a go there is much discussion

0:45

of the pros and cons of org mode versus

0:46

obsidian that you could find online but

0:48

for me the sinking story specifically

0:50

onto my mobile phone was unacceptable

0:52

contrary to popular belief I don't spend

0:54

all my life in front of a computer

0:56

sometimes I go out for food and when I

0:58

do I can't leave my brain behind

## Active Externalism

1:00

the theory I'm using here is called

1:02

active externalism part of the extended

1:05

mind thesis the idea is that our mind is

1:08

more than our physical brain it extends

1:10

to paper computers abacuses your fingers

1:12

for counting and for me Obsidian

1:14

obsidian is freeware and not open source

1:17

and while that usually is a problem for

1:18

me it's not in this instance my data is

1:22

open stored as plain text markdown the

1:24

two-person company behind obsidian may

1:26

eventually go away but my data is stored

1:29

on my computer in plain text Will

1:31

Dropbox Google Drive and iCloud all

1:33

exist in 10 years I wouldn't bet my

1:35

brain on it obsidian is free for

1:38

personal use and the two value-add

1:39

Services sync and publish have a fair

1:41

monthly fee to support the company it's

1:43

perhaps as good a time as any to say

1:45

that this video is not sponsored I just

1:47

love obsidian obsidian works everywhere

1:49

and where it doesn't I still have the

1:51

data in plain text so I can edit and

1:53

read it with any text editor obsidian

1:55

sync is fantastic and the reason I

1:57

switched better than Dropbox better than

2:00

iCloud better than get or sync think

2:02

better than whatever you're thinking of

2:03

you don't need to pay for obsidian sync

2:06

however there are many plugins that

2:07

support Dropbox or git but getting those

2:09

working on a phone is non-trivial so

2:11

they get my money for their seamless

2:12

native sync offline first means that the

2:14

data is stored on your computer or phone

2:17

you control it it's just plain text

2:19

files like a Wiki obsidian is a set of

2:22

linked Pages or notes building knowledge

2:24

through links between pages is awesomely

2:26

useful and why we built the web in the

2:28

first place at the time of recording

2:30

obsidian has 1014 plugins in the

2:33

built-in plugin installer and you may

2:34

easily sideload your own without going

2:36

through this method if you would like

2:37

plugins are written in JavaScript and

2:39

can change any part of the system

2:41

obsidian is the most popular of the

2:43

markdown based note takers and in my

2:45

opinion the best of all note systems I

2:48

have tried nearly every cross-platform

2:50

note-taking app of the last two decades

2:52

the ones I've used seriously start with

2:54

Evernote and end with obsidian all these

2:56

tools are great and if you don't get on

2:58

with obsidian you could have a look at

2:59

them but all of them except the last two

3:01

hold your data to Ransom notion

3:04

especially is very Insidious because it

3:06

looks like markdown in their pretty

3:07

browser editor but if you export it the

3:10

export is full of proprietary tags and

3:12

symbols that are not portable keep that

3:14

in mind if you take my advice you'll try

3:17

obsidian first you can download it for

## Obsidian Vault

3:19

all platforms even weird ones such as

3:20

Windows for arm Raspberry Pi and my

3:22

distro Asahi Linux running on Apple

3:24

silicon after you've installed you will

3:27

be asked where you would like to store

3:28

your notes in obsidian terms this is

3:30

called a vault but it's just a folder

3:32

put it in your documents directory in

3:34

Dropbox on a USB drive or wherever you

3:36

would like it to live you can also open

3:38

a folder full of markdown files as a new

3:40

Vault this is very handy for editing

3:42

existing markdown folders perhaps books

3:44

blogs or GitHub repos and the last

3:47

option lets you log in with your

3:49

obsidian sync account and download one

3:50

of your synced faults when you first set

3:52

up your obsidian Vault it will be empty

3:54

no markdown files no notes and you will

3:56

be greeted with this screen let's do as

3:58

it says and create a new note with Ctrl

4:00

or command n for this demo I'll name the

4:03

first note the topic I'm currently

4:05

researching which we'll say is how the

4:07

web works by pressing Ctrl n i can

4:10

create new files like here a web browser

4:12

note where I'm going to write up my

4:13

research including links to other ideas

4:14

as they come up it's worth talking about

4:17

markdown formatting at this point

4:18

obsidian like slack Discord many

4:21

websites and sometimes Facebook

4:22

depending on the phase of the moon

4:24

formats text using a lightweight

4:26

standard called markdown markdown is

4:28

really simple to use and is designed to

4:30

look good in both plain text and

4:32

rendered as Rich Text unlike HTML which

4:34

is unreadable by most people in less

4:36

rendered in a browser here we've got a

4:38

heading denoted by the hash symbol

4:39

italic with underscores bold with double

4:41

asterisks and links using double square

4:43

brackets there are a few more options

4:45

available which you can look up here but

4:47

this is the overwhelming majority of

4:48

formatting you'll need on a day-to-day

4:50

basis back to the demo I followed the

## Demo

4:52

link into my DNS resolution note and

4:54

added a few tasks for myself using

4:56

markdown checkboxes and some tags we'll

4:58

see both of those again later but now

5:00

now the thing every obsidian demo must

5:02

have the graph the graph is accessed

5:05

through the command palette and is how

5:07

you get quick access to everything

5:08

inside obsidian hit Ctrl P to open it

5:11

every function button and feature of

5:13

obsidian is searchable from the list and

5:15

if you don't know exactly what you're

5:16

looking for just type some likely Search

5:18

terms it'll fuzzy find it all here is

5:20

our graph so far in the middle our web

5:23

browser note and everything we've linked

5:24

to from that page see we've only

5:26

actually made notes for DNS resolution

5:28

and the top level how does the web work

5:30

note that's why they are in white nodes

5:32

in Gray are linked to but not created

5:34

yet this is huge this allows you to fill

5:38

in the gaps in your knowledge

5:39

incrementally here it's clear I've not

5:42

learned about JavaScript yet it's a link

5:43

to a note that doesn't exist students

5:46

and researchers pay attention all this

5:48

works on mobile by the way perfectly

5:50

synced with obsidian sync or whatever

5:51

method you would prefer it's all just

5:53

plain text files this is example of my

5:56

mature ish graph by the way I've colored

5:58

lost terminal scripts green my Daily

5:59

Journal notes Orange and in red is my

6:01

video schedule main note very pretty

6:04

let's click back to our original how

6:06

does the web work note there are no

6:08

markdown links here but I've clicked the

6:09

back links tab on the right and we can

6:11

see that the web browser note links back

6:14

to this note this for database nerds is

6:17

like a foreign key relationship a list

6:20

of all notes that links back to the

6:22

notes you are currently reading obsidian

6:24

allows you to follow links both ways

6:26

along your knowledge graph allowing you

6:28

to explore your brain you click normal

6:31

links to get from the web browser note

6:32

to the other two notes on the right and

6:34

to go back you follow the automatically

6:36

generated backlinks if we open the DNS

6:39

resolution note again we can see the

6:40

backlink to the web browser note here

6:42

too let's open that web browser note you

6:45

can see in purple the links we just saw

6:46

but I also have clicked on the outgoing

6:49

links tab on the right and we can see

6:51

them there too note the two different

6:53

icons indicating a link to a page that

6:55

exists and pages that don't exist same

6:58

as the white and gray nodes on our graph

6:59

same as the bright and dim purple links

7:02

in the note body itself okay okay

7:04

tutorial over go test it out for

7:06

yourself it's way easier in person let's

7:08

look at the plugins plugins change the

7:10

way obsidian behaves in small or large

7:12

ways up to and including embedding

7:14

entirely new ways of working with your

7:16

data like here the built-in canvas

7:18

plugin which I used earlier this allows

7:20

instead of working with your notes in

7:22

tabs or splits or Windows you to throw

7:25

them on a canvas in whatever layout you

7:27

would like notice that I'm actually

7:28

editing the web browser note in this

7:30

screenshot it's not just about the

7:32

layout how does notion store canvas data

7:34

there are limits to markdown of course

7:36

the standard for storing non-document

7:38

data is a human readable Json file

7:40

canvas and all the other plugins store

7:42

their metadata in this portable format

7:44

no binary databases anywhere everything

7:46

is in plain text all Native obsidian

## Plugins

7:49

functionality can be toggled on and off

7:50

inside the settings most of the core

7:52

plugins are enabled by default so if you

7:54

would prefer a more minimal streamlined

7:56

app you could turn them all off and

7:58

still have the best markdown editor on

7:59

the planet there are a few plugins

8:01

disabled by default publish sync slides

8:03

and workspaces are the big ones one that

8:06

is enabled by default that I will

8:07

highlight is tag support you can tag

8:10

your notes in two main ways in the body

8:12

of the note with a hashtag or in the

8:13

front matter of the page the front

8:15

matter is a section of configuration at

8:17

the start of the document where you can

8:18

add your own keys and values and plugins

8:20

can then act on this metadata the

8:22

built-in tag plugin for instance reads

8:24

the list of tags from this front matter

8:25

as well as inside the body of the note

8:28

front matter is in yaml format another

8:30

open standard now that I've tagged the

8:33

how does the webwork document with

8:34

research web and to do tags they show up

8:36

on the graph by default in a different

8:38

color I also added some tags to the

8:40

other documents at the same time you can

8:42

search for tags like here in the top

8:43

left I'm searching for all notes with

8:45

the DNS tag there's only one result of

8:47

course linear folder organization is a

8:49

little restrictive so let's install the

8:51

tag folder plugin from Community plugins

8:53

in obsidian settings this plugin shows

8:56

tags like folders here on the left you

8:59

can search through nested tags in a

9:01

folder-like structure these are the two

9:03

main ways of organizing your obsidian

9:04

Vault by the way tags or folders you can

9:07

either have no folders organizing

9:09

everything with tags or a traditional

9:10

folder tree I'm not sure which is best

9:12

try them both now we're going to unlock

9:15

obsidian's real power with the data view

9:17

plugin I think this plugin should be

9:19

built in it's so ubiquitous install it

9:22

and then in the data view settings

9:23

enable all the query toggles at the top

9:25

here side note markdown has a way to add

9:27

code Snippets perhaps HTML JavaScript or

9:30

any other code you would like inside

9:31

triple backticks with an optional name

9:33

for syntax highlighting on the first

9:35

line This is Handy for writing code

9:37

documentation of any kind not just

9:39

programming but Wiki markup BB code

9:41

Discord formatting or anything like that

9:43

and dataview uses it to encode its

9:45

queries dataview allows you to treat

## DataView

9:47

your Vault your brain your collection of

9:49

linked tagged markdown files as a

9:51

database you can query this database

9:53

simply using SQL or get programmatic

9:55

access to it using inline JavaScript if

9:57

you know how to code you can already

9:59

imagine how the JavaScript query SDK

10:01

works so I will focus on simple SQL

10:03

queries which are what most

10:04

non-programmers will use this code block

10:06

when you click away from it renders the

10:08

data view query and becomes a table

10:10

listing all nodes tagged to do ordered

10:13

by their creation time data view can

10:15

filter notes by date length tags titles

10:17

links backlinks anything you can imagine

10:19

and you can build your own systems and

10:21

rules simply using it the last plugin I

10:25

want to demo is the maps view plugin

10:26

installed in the same way as all other

10:28

plugins through settings then Community

10:29

plugins now hit Ctrl P to open up the

10:32

command palette and type mapfront matter

10:34

this will open up a location search for

10:36

any place in the world the results

10:38

provided by openstreetmap though the

10:40

Google Maps API is toggleable in the

10:42

settings here I've done that for UCL in

10:45

London note the coordinates in the front

10:46

matter of the document UCLA in

10:49

California and UCB now my research is

10:51

really starting to come together with

10:53

the primary arpanet sites the precursor

10:55

to the internet graphed inside my

10:57

obsidian Vault just like the internet as

10:59

you build your your brain the links

11:01

between notes become exponentially

11:03

greater and obsidian becomes

11:05

exponentially more useful I've run out

11:07

of time there are so many cool plugins

11:09

that I simply can't get around to

11:11

talking about today Advanced slides day

11:12

planner dice Rolex Scala draw GPT 3

11:14

notes kanban language tool and linta my

11:17

11:19

11:21
