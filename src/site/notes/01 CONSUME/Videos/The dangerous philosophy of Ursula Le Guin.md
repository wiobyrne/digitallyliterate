0:00

we live in capitalism its power seems inescapable so did the divine right of

0:06

kings any human power can be resisted and changed by human beings resistance

0:13

and change often begin in art very often

0:18

in our heart the art of words \[Applause\]

0:25

among the most acclaimed and respected science fiction writers of the 20th

0:30

century a best-selling author in 40 languages multiple winner of the Hugo

0:35

and nebula Awards and inspiration to Generations who have followed her here

0:42

in the 21st century Le Guin has become something more than a beloved author she

0:49

has become an icon she may be the only classic Sci-fi writer to regularly trend

0:55

on Twitter's one of my favorite authors

1:01

science fiction is the art that builds worlds in her science fiction stories

1:07

Ursula Le Guin didn't just tell us a better world was possible she showed us

1:12

better Worlds by building them in the imagination of generations worlds where

1:18

life is fairer more equal and more just

1:23

at this point in time when a better world seems to be slipping through our fingers I want to understand the better

1:31

worlds that Ursula Le Guin showed us I want to dig down to the big ideas that

1:36

shaped Le guin's storytelling I want to understand not just Ursula Le Guin the

1:43

Sci-Fi writer but Ursula Le Guin the philosopher

1:50

through the medium of sci-fi and fantasy Ursula Le Guin spoke a powerful philosophy a philosophy that shows us

1:57

how the art of words can resist and change the world in which human imagination our ideas and feelings our

2:05

dreams and visions and the Very Stories We Tell have the power to shape reality

2:12

it's a philosophy of immense power the power to build worlds and the power

2:19

to destroy them wait wait wait right there we're talking

2:26

about a kissy author the lady who rode those dragon books right well you might be

2:32

confusing the subject of this Essay with Anne McCaffrey or janiolin or any of the

2:39

intelligent sci-fi and fantasy writers who have created beautiful and politically relevant stories for

2:45

children if you mean to change the world where better to start than the dreams of

2:51

the young Ursula Le guin's career stretched over six decades but the work

2:56

she remains most famous for and that we're going to be thinking about here

3:01

were created in a brief few years between 1968 and 1974. think of these as

3:08

Le guin's Bob Dylan years when she created the tunes most of us still hum

3:14

along to that's not to reduce the rest of Le guin's career but here we're thinking about the core philosophy of Le

3:21

Guin her big Ideas you don't need to have read these books to follow this and

3:26

we won't be spoiling them in fact we're not going to be talking about most of what's special about these stories not

3:34

the quality of Le guin's writing or her poetic imagery we're just going to find

3:39

the big ideas that are the philosophy of Ursula Le Guin to do that we're going to

3:46

name check a number of famed philosophers you don't need to know who Emmanuel Kant is have read Hegel or any

3:53

of the German idealists but if you want to go deeper into philosophy I recommend

3:58

the channel of Professor Michael sugru as an excellent guide if things get a

4:04

bit too abstract and confusing along the way just hang on we'll try to bring it all

4:11

together at the end okay the left hand of Darkness published in 1969 the lathe of

4:18

Heaven 1971 and the dispossessed 1974 defined Le Guin as a science fiction

4:26

author in a unique achievement Le Guin simultaneously wrote and published a

4:33

fantasy trilogy The Wizard of Earth sea 1968 the tombs of echuan 1970 and the

4:40

farthest Shore 1972. and for good measure in 1973 Le Guin

4:46

published the ones who walk away from amilas one of the most famous science

4:52

fiction stories ever published what kind of music do you usually have

4:58

here oh we got both cards we got country and western science fiction surely

5:03

omolas is a fantasy story Le Guin was one of many authors who saw Science

5:10

Fiction and Fantasy as flip sides of the same coin all fiction is metaphor

5:16

science fiction is metaphor Le Guin argues in her introduction to the left hand of Darkness but metaphor for what

5:24

keep that question in mind on our journey to understand Le guin's writing

5:30

and her philosophy we need to place her in context as a woman writer working in

5:35

the male dominated field of American Science Fiction of the late 1960s but

5:41

the women on your planet are logical that's the only planet in this galaxy that can make that claim

5:48

a machine does not care Tom Godwin the cold equations the cold equations 1954

5:56

is a science fiction story Ursula Le Guin would have read when she was a

6:01

young writer and fan of Amazing Stories magazine it tells of a young woman who

6:07

stows away on a spacecraft but the ship only has fuel for its Mission so the

6:13

cold equations of reality dictates the girl must be blown out of the airlock

6:20

it's widely believed that while the story was offered by Tom Godwin it's

6:25

rather incredible ending the young woman willingly accepts her sacrifice was

6:31

dictated by the legendary editor of Amazing Stories magazine John W Campbell

6:38

Campbell shaped the field of American Science Fiction which grew up in the pulp magazines of the early 20th century

6:44

around the idea of stories that extrapolate to current science into the

6:50

future Campbell formalized the label science fiction to describe such stories

6:57

the cold equations exemplifies cambelly and sci-fi that sees reality as a set of

7:05

cold hard facts sitting out in the void of space reality as a machine that does

7:12

not care and cambelly and sci-fi displayed a casual disregard for women

7:18

whom it frequently caricatures unreasoning creatures who put feelings

7:24

before the cold hard equations of reality early science fiction was

7:30

created by women writers like Margaret Cavender Sean Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley hundreds of other women writers

7:37

through the 18th and 19th centuries imagined a diverse array of utopian and

7:44

feminist Futures you can learn more in my podcast episode about the true

7:49

History of Science Fiction but canbellian science fiction largely wrote

7:55

women out of the field the history of of Science Fiction was Rewritten to start with Jules Verne and H.G Wells relative

8:03

latecomers and the definition of Science Fiction was narrowed to exclude those

8:09

earlier feminist Utopias and include only pure scientific speculation the

8:16

ones who walk away from omilas 1973 can be read as a rejoinder to stories like

8:24

the cold equations both are short stories that use a kind of reductio AD

8:30

absurdum pushing an argument that limits of logic to show where it breaks

8:37

the city of omilas is a perfect Utopia except for one child who is held

8:43

prisoner to suffer for all most in omelas except this bargain but the ones

8:50

who walk away from omilas exemplify a higher morality rejecting Injustice and

8:56

accepting the unknown perhaps even death instead in her introduction to her debut

9:02

novel The Left Hand of Darkness written some years after its publication Le Guin

9:08

devastates the cambellian idea of speculative sci-fi stating that it

9:13

always arrives somewhere between the gradual Extinction of human Liberty and

9:19

the total Extinction of human life if the cold equations argues that reality

9:25

is a machine that does not care omalas replies even so the only moral path is

9:32

to resist whatever the consequence is and so the gauntlet was thrown down for

9:38

a clash of philosophies between cambelly and sci-fi versus Ursula Le Guin

9:45

cambelly and sci-fi believed a better world could be made by science and

9:50

technology any problem could be fixed by just building bigger and better machines

9:56

that the natural universe is made of matter particles and forces an uncaring

10:03

machine governed by the cold equations of reality we can call this the philosophy of materialism realism or

10:11

naturalism Ursula Le Guin was a revolutionary force in science fiction because she championed an alternate

10:18

philosophy a philosophical school which argues that the human world is shaped by

10:24

human thinking that the Universe and everything in it are the product of

10:29

human mental formations of human ideas the philosophy of idealism I think her

10:37

hard times are coming when we will be wanting the voices of writers who can

10:42

see Alternatives can see through our fear-stricken society and its obsessive

10:49

Technologies to other ways of being we will need writers who can remember

10:55

Freedom the realists of a larger reality

11:03

foreign the left hand of Darkness explores one

11:08

of the most controversial and politically charged issues of our time gender

11:15

generally Ali is a man on a mission to invite the planet of gethan to join the

11:22

Acumen a political Alliance trying to re-establish Galactic Civilization the

11:28

people of gethin have no fixed gender identities which generally is very slow

11:35

to understand he forms a deep relationship with a Geffen native but is

11:41

unable to overcome his gender perceptions to recognize that he's in

11:46

love our entire pattern of socio-sexual interaction is non-existent here they

11:53

cannot play the game they do not see one another as men or women this is almost

11:58

impossible for our imagination to accept what is the first question we ask about

12:04

a newborn baby Ursula K Le Guin the left hand of Darkness even when the left hand

12:10

of Darkness was written women were still seen as the second sex Evolution and

12:16

biology materialist philosophy argued had made women smaller weaker even less

12:22

intelligent their role was as second-class Citizens if they were citizens at all those were the cold

12:30

equations of gender understood through the dominant materialist philosophy that

12:36

was reality feminist philosophers from Simone de Beauvoir to Judith Butler

12:42

argued instead that gender was performative sex may be biologically

12:48

determined but contributed only a part to the performance of gender in

12:54

opposition to the dominant realist concept of gender was constructed an alternative idealist philosophy gender

13:03

was a mental concept an idea that could be changed or even abandoned

13:09

in the imagined world of Geffen Le Guin is able to model gender performativity

13:15

to see what remains behind after gender is removed the left hand of Darkness

13:22

became a classic work of Science Fiction because it moved the idealist philosophy

13:28

of gender performativity out of the realm of theory and into the powerful world of story Ursula Le Guin completed

13:37

seven novels in the heinish sequence each exploring radical ideas that would

13:43

influence science fiction authors who followed including e m Banks and Anne

13:48

Leckie the dispossessed is arguably the most radical of Le guin's novels a

13:54

refugee scientist the creator of Le guin's famous ansible travels from the

14:00

anarchist Utopia of anares to the capitalist nation of uras like any good

14:06

Utopia since Thomas Moore defines the concept kept in his 1516 book of that

14:12

title the dispossessed imagines a world run under a single political ideology

14:18

anarchism in this case and what the consequences might be the outcome is

14:24

equivocal as Le Guin concedes in her books subtitle an ambiguous Utopia

14:30

anarchism is a political ideology built on idealist philosophy it asserts that

14:36

humans are not simply products of nature driven by greed and violence in a fight

14:42

for survival instead human ideas about Humanity like justice fairness and peace

14:49

are fundamental to human existence anarchism has its roots with idealist

14:55

philosophers like Jean-Jacques Rousseau who believed in the essential goodness

15:00

of humanity remove unjust social structures like kings and governments

15:06

Rousseau argued and human goodness would flourish Rousseau's ideas directly

15:13

inspired both the French and American Revolutions fought in the name of ideas

15:19

like Liberty freedom and equality if Le guin's Anarchist Utopia is ambiguous

15:27

it's because real world anarchies are too the Anarchy that followed the French

15:32

Revolution cost thousands of lives to The Gila team and the American Revolution produced not an anarchist

15:40

Utopia but modern capitalism but the idealist philosophy of the dispossessed

15:46

goes even deeper than politics Le Guin takes on one of the most fundamental

15:52

arguments in philosophy the concept of time itself the refugee scientist shevek

16:00

is developing a new theory of time that will lead to the creation of the ansible

16:06

Le guin's famous invention for faster than light communication but chevex

16:12

Theory arises not from a breakthrough discovery of quantum physics but from an

16:19

insight into the shape of time time has two aspects there is the arrow the

16:27

running River without which there is no change no progress or direction or

16:32

creation and there is the circle or the cycle without which there is chaos a

16:40

meaningless progression of instance a world without clocks or Seasons or

16:45

promises Ursula K Le Guin the dispossess Le guin's concept of time is mirrored in

16:51

the great granddaddy of idealist philosophy Emmanuel Kant Kant famously

16:58

and rather controversially classified both time and space not as things

17:04

happening out there in the universe but as categories of human perception

17:11

space and time are the framework within which the mind is constrained to

17:18

construct its experience of reality Kant argued that humans could only ever

17:24

perceive reality through the structures of our mind the reality Beyond these

17:30

structures the thing itself could never be known space time objects movement

17:37

relationship were not the true numera of reality but the phenomena of the Mind

17:45

later idealist philosophers would ask the question how are the structures of

17:50

the Mind formed the answer that would revolutionize modern philosophy was language that the structures of the mind

17:59

and the reality we experience are shaped by the language we speak languages as a

18:07

power that can shape reality are Central to Ursula Le guin's philosophy not least

18:13

her Earthsea novels and to understand Earthsea we need to look beyond the

18:19

conscious mind and towards its Dark Shadow the unconscious

18:27

the unconscious mind is co-extensive with the universe Ursula Le Guin the

18:35

dispossessed \[Music\] Earthsea is a fantasy land an

18:42

archipelago of islands where magic rules magic is practiced through language in

18:49

Earthsea all things have a common name and a true name knowing the true name of

18:55

a thing gives you power over that thing whether it's a cloud a flower a goat or

19:02

a dragon the true name reveals the thing itself the wizard of Earth sea 1968

19:09

reaches its inciting incident when the ambitious young wizard dead accidentally

19:15

succeeds in severing himself from his shadow with this act GED who had been a

19:21

wild and Powerful young wizard becomes meek and uncertain to regain his power

19:27

GED will have to reintegrate his shadow GED had neither lost nor won but naming

19:36

the shadow of his death with his own name had made himself whole a man who

19:41

knowing his whole true self cannot be used or possessed by any power other

19:48

than himself Ursula Le Guin the wizard of Earthsea the Shadow and the self are

19:54

Central images from the psychological fairies of Carl Jung in her essay in myth and archetype in science fiction

20:01

Ursula Le Guin talks about the place of jungian symbolism in her storytelling

20:07

it's clear that the Earthsea novels are expressions of Carl Jung's theory of

20:13

archetypes the tombs of achuan continues the jungian fantasy tanar is a young

20:19

woman who has been raised as The High Priestess of an Arcane Faith she is lost

20:25

within a labyrinth and guided to Freedom by GED who appears as the masculine

20:31

ideal of tanar's Dreams the archetype the Carl Jung labels the anima

20:39

Carl Jung was a swish psychiatrist who began his career in the realist

20:44

materialist Paradigm with his mentor Sigmund Freud Jung was an early Explorer

20:50

of the concept of the unconscious the idea that most of our thinking happens

20:57

outside the awareness of the conscious mind study of the unconscious through Carl

21:04

Jung into the deep Waters of idealist philosophy young was ambivalent towards

21:11

philosophers like Kant and Hegel but the deeper he swam into the

21:16

unconscious the more unescapable idealism became

21:21

Jung left his scientific research and spent years in inner contemplation

21:27

producing his famous illuminated manuscript the Lieber Novus

21:33

young claims to have discovered structures of the unconscious mind

21:39

structures he called the archetypes of self Persona Shadow anima and more

21:47

Ursula Le Guin adopts these ideas of the unconscious and the jungian archetypes

21:54

to rewrite The Narrative of fantasy the war between the dark lord and the good

21:59

king of tolkien's Middle Earth are replaced in the Gwen's Earth sea with

22:05

the Quest for self-knowledge the evil we must defeat is not out there in the

22:12

world Le Guin tells her young readers but inside our own cells the farthest

22:19

Shore the third volume of earth sea introduces the darkest and most complex

22:25

of the jungian archetypes the demiurge or false god magic has left the land of

22:32

Earth sea and GED now an older man must sail out to find the cause the farthest

22:38

Shore is a haunting and challenging story dead is now the mentor to a young prince Aaron who will complete his own

22:45

Heroes Journey Through the story as they travel Aaron is tormented by

22:52

doubts about his mentor sometimes get appears as the archmage of Rogue at

22:58

other times he's just an ignorant old man earthc has fallen under the magic of a

23:05

dark wizard named Cobb Cobb needs no armies Of Orcs he is not Conquering the

23:11

world the power of magic is to rewrite reality itself the conflict between GED

23:19

and Cobb is about who controls reality the demiurge is an archetype that dates

23:25

back to at least early Christianity the Gnostic sect believed the Old Testament

23:31

Jehovah to be a false god named Yao de boath

23:36

Carl Young described his own encounter with the demiurge named Abraxas in his

23:42

Lieber Novus in the farthest Shore Ursula Le Guin has encountered her own

23:48

demiurge the ending of the story is opaque and symbolically dense

23:54

it reads as though the author is struggling to navigate the inner world

24:00

she is exploring Le Guin is a young writer in her 40s who is unpacking these

24:06

ideas as she goes after the furthest Shore and those six

24:12

years of intense creativity Ursula Le guin's writing slows substantially she

24:18

doesn't return to Earthsea for 18 years perhaps she is searching for answers to

24:24

the questions raised by her philosophical questing and her encounter

24:29

with the demiurge and the dangers that encounter revealed

24:35

to begin to pull all these ideas together and before we dive into a final

24:42

Le guin's story let's think more about philosophy philosophy means love of

24:50

wisdom from the Greek Philo a form of love and Sophia the goddess of wisdom

24:58

only a fool would think that a philosophy without women would be wise

25:05

but as is widely noted the Canon of philosophy features almost no women the

25:12

Storyteller and philosopher Clarissa pinkola Estes suggests that women have

25:18

instead passed their wisdom down through stories

25:24

it's increasingly recognized that many of the greatest Mythic stories passed

25:29

down through history were perhaps offered by women the anonymous Jay

25:36

author of The Genesis myths was a Babylonian princess God may not be a

25:42

woman but his scriptwriter was analysis of the Odyssey suggests Homer

25:48

was a woman writer satirizing the toxic masculinity of the classical era

25:54

European folklore is stamped with the names of Hans Christian Anderson and The

25:59

Brothers Grimm but these were stories told by women for women about women

26:07

add in those women writers who created science fiction their names scrubbed

26:13

from its history and we have a pattern forming to give Ursula leguen her full

26:20

Jew we must think of her in that tradition of great women's storytellers

26:27

philosopher poets who expressed their wisdom in stories

26:32

that LE guin's stories are not only great science fiction but mephic stories

26:39

that Express a deep and Powerful philosophy and as she explored the power

26:45

of this philosophy Ursula Le Guin also considered the dangers that came with

26:51

such power in the archetypal figure of the demiurge

26:59

slow Le Guin titled the lathe of heaven after a mistranslation from the Taoist

27:05

poet zwangzi that mistake aside the title poetically captures the essence of

27:12

Le guin's philosophy George Orr are likely nods to Orwell and 1984. is an

27:19

ordinary man who believes his dreams can change reality but instead of using this power for

27:26

himself or is exploited by the psychologist William Harbor a man of

27:33

stronger will Harbor's various attempts to shape ore's dreams to Make a Better World all result

27:41

in a worse world but make Harbor ever more powerful the strength of Harbors

27:47

will allows him to control reality until all fights back

27:53

the conflict between ore and harbor in the Laver Heaven mirrors the conflict

27:58

between GED and Cobb in the farthest Shore both are encounters with the

28:05

demiurge archetype conflicts over the most fundamental question

28:10

if human willpower can reshape reality the question becomes whose will it's

28:17

kind of like old fairy tales where somebody's trying to do good and is always sort of defeated by reality

28:24

you've got to go with the flow you can't push the river as the Buddhists say uh and poor Haber in the book is is a

28:31

do-gooder but George is sort of in tune with things I go with the flow man go

28:36

with the flow man and uh of course this is a Taoist book the taoism in is was pretty conscious

28:44

what do you mean by that a lot of people say what does she mean a Taoist book well in the in the crooner sense that

28:51

the taoism says you do things by not doing things and all attempt to do and to to to set

28:58

things right and to make things happen eventually

29:03

backfires the lathe of Heaven is Le guin's Taoist novel The Gwyn had a

29:09

lifelong interest in the Eastern philosophy of taoism in contrast to the Confucian tradition that emphasizes

29:16

rigid social order and taoism is a philosophy of change and flexibility

29:22

that emphasizes the need to flow with the forces that surround us the lathe of

29:28

heaven with its failed experiments in reshaping human social order is Le

29:34

guin's most complex Fort experiment on the question of is a better world

29:40

possible and what if the new world turns out not to be better at all it's a book

29:48

that asks hard questions about the utopian vision of a better world

29:54

utopianism was given a new energy by the philosophy of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich

30:01

Hegel Hegel built on the idealism of Kent to argue that the structures of the

30:08

human mind didn't just shape our perception of reality but the history

30:14

and development of human civilization history Hegel argued had a shape and by

30:22

understanding that shape we could progress to the end of History where a

30:28

better world was possible hegel's ideas influenced both liberal

30:34

and socialist utopian dreams but the most famous thinker to be inspired by

30:41

the hegelian model of History was Karl Marx father of Marxism

30:47

Marx's ideas for a communist Utopia at the end of History were so convincing to

30:53

peoples who dreamed of a better world the Communist Revolution spread worldwide in the 20th century

31:02

but time and again these utopian revolutions served not the workers but a

31:09

new intellectual Elite who had the intelligence and strength of will to lead such revolutions like George or the

31:16

workers of the world discovered they did have the power to make a better world

31:22

but that power was taken from them by men of stronger will like William Haber

31:28

or Joseph Stalin or Mao Zedong or Adolf

31:34

Hitler or Fidel Castro the Cuban dictator who famously declared

31:40

a better world is possible

31:46

all fiction is metaphor science fiction is metaphor

31:51

\[Music\] the lathe of Heaven is metaphor for the

31:56

human will to power no lone man can reshape reality with his dreams but the

32:04

human Collective has it within our power to create almost any reality we can

32:09

dream or imagine but whose dreams whose imagination will

32:15

be made real whose will has the power science fiction in its golden age under

32:22

John W Campbell created metaphors for the philosophy of realism and naturalism

32:27

it expressed the dreams of rational men who believes the world could be made better with science and technology and

32:35

but as those dreams became real as the space Rockets nuclear weapons and

32:40

artificial intelligence of sci-fi dreams came into reality

32:46

they failed to Make a Better World technology is just a tool in the hands

32:52

of humans driven by human ideas Ursula Le Guin was not alone in

33:00

challenging cambelly and science fiction other authors of the new wave like Samuel Delaney and JG Ballard joined her

33:08

but Le guin's stories have proved the most long-lasting because they are the

33:13

most powerful metaphors for the philosophy that challenges materialism the philosophy of idealism to Make a

33:22

Better World Le Guin argues we need to understand the inner world of

33:27

imagination and dreams that shape the outer World in this essay we've looked

33:33

at some of the philosophical ideas that Ursula Le guin's stories Echo I'm not

33:38

suggesting Ursula Le Guin set out to create metaphors for cantian idealism

33:44

but rather that LE Guin as a great thinker and Creator was discovering for

33:49

herself new ways of conceptualizing reality and by expressing those ideas in

33:56

stories Le Guin became one of or perhaps the greatest philosopher Poets of our

34:04

time if we were to give Ursula Le guin's philosophy and name we might call it

34:10

radical idealism radical in three senses firstly that it

34:16

models a pure idealism in which language archetypes of the unconscious and the

34:23

conceptual structures of Mind create our reality secondly that there is a power

34:30

in knowing the true names at the root of reality and that fundamental concepts

34:37

like gender and identity can be controlled and changed

34:43

thirdly that control over the root concepts of reality should serve radical

34:49

social change the danger of Ursula Le guin's philosophy of radical idealism is

34:56

twofold firstly there is the haunting question of whose reality as we awaken

35:04

to the potential of the human Collective will to reshape our reality in the image

35:11

of our dreams and stories we need to be aware that our dreams do not become

35:18

nightmares and that the story We Tell is a good one

35:23

there is the constant threat that those who win the fight for reality are those

35:29

with the strongest will but the least wisdom the Demi urges of our time the

35:36

second danger is less obvious but more immediate if we accept the idealist

35:42

model that the mind and Imagination can in some sense shape reality then it's

35:50

clear that we aren't the first to realize this those with real power have

35:55

always known it Caesars and Kings politicians and popes billionaires and

36:02

media magnates all know that part of their power rests on controlling the

36:09

narrative shaping the ideas and Concepts that in turn shape our reality the power

36:17

of Ursula Le guin's storytelling is that it reaches into our dreams and

36:22

Imagination it weaves meaning from symbol metaphor

36:28

and archetype it crafts Mythic stories to awaken all who read it to the Deep

36:35

truths of our reality truths that are no longer hidden and

36:41

secret but are now being learned by all Ursula Le guin's philosophy is dangerous

36:48

because it awakens the once powerless to the potential of our own power

36:56

those who cling to unjust power over others might find that very dangerous
