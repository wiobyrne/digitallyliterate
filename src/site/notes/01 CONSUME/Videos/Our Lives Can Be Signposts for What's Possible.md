# Our Lives Can Be Signposts for What's Possible

![Vincent Harding — Our Lives Can Be Signposts for What's Possible (Becoming Wise)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L4MPOhC-Gk)

## Description

A civil rights elder and speechwriter for Martin Luther King Jr., the late Vincent Harding brought the wisdom of the movement to young people in hurting places. He offers the image of a “live human signpost” as a guiding light toward the kind of support and mentorship we can offer one another in the path toward a beloved community. “When it comes to creating a multiracial, multiethnic, multireligious, democratic society, we are still a developing nation,” he says. “But my own deep, deep conviction is that the knowledge, like all knowledge, is available to us if we seek it.” (Original Air Date: May 13, 2019)

I've had hundreds of big conversations

  0: 12

and my conversation partners share

  0: 15

wisdom I carry with me wherever I go

  0: 17

here's an image I love of the late

  0: 20

Vincent Harding of what we can all be

  0: 22

live human signposts Vincent Harding

  0: 26

himself was a live human signpost and he

  0: 29

remains a mentor to me and countless

  0: 31

others he was a central figure in the

  0: 33

civil rights movement a speechwriter

  0: 35

from Martin Luther King jr. he spent the

  0: 38

rest of his life on a project called

  0: 40

veterans of hope

  0: 41

bringing the wisdom of the movement to

  0: 43

young people in hurting places

  0: 50

this is becoming wise I'm Krista Tippett

  1: 04

there's a story you tell that was about

## Signposts

  1: 06

your conversation encounter you were

  1: 08

having a hard neighborhood in Boston and

  1: 10

a young man named Darryl yes what do you

  1: 14

tell that story about signposts his

  1: 17

image of signposts hmm what I remember

  1: 22

from that story was that their young

  1: 26

friend of mine

  1: 28

Eugene rivers young at that time I guess

  1: 31

Jean Jean in Boston is still busy Boston

  1: 35

yeah I met this young man in Eugene's

  1: 38

apartment and this young man came up

  1: 44

just to sit next to me because he wanted

  1: 47

to talk in a more personal way it turned

  1: 50

out that he was one of the leaders of

  1: 53

the drug-running folks at the time but

  1: 58

what he said to me was that he really

  2: 01

felt that one of the reasons why he had

  2: 04

gone in the way that he had gone not

  2: 07

trying in any way to excuse himself was

  2: 11

the fact thing he like many other young

  2: 14

people were operating in a situation

  2: 17

where they felt it was just very very

  2: 20

dark all around them and what they

  2: 25

needed were as he put it some some

  2: 29

signposts some lights that would in

  2: 33

other people's lives live human

  2: 37

signposts yes yes that would help them

  2: 41

to see the possibilities for themselves

  2: 45

and will open up possibilities that

  2: 49

other people can't see and any other way

  2: 52

except seeing it through human beings

  2: 55

who care about them and if we teach

  2: 58

young people to run away from the

  3: 01

darkness rather than to open up the

  3: 05

light in the darkness to be the candles

  3: 08

the signposts then we are doing great

  3: 11

harm to them and the communities are

  3: 15

that they have come out of

  3: 17

I think this word signposts in this

## Find the Elders

  3: 20

image of psychosis is really important I

  3: 22

think it's an important piece of

  3: 23

practical vocabulary what you also tell

  3: 27

young people is that they have to find

  3: 29

the elders right like I've thought a lot

  3: 30

over the years

  3: 31

about the teaching in the Hebrew Bible

  3: 35

and they test to me that I think has

  3: 36

resonance across the traditions of

  3: 38

developing eyes to see and ears to hear

  3: 40

you think of that as almost a spiritual

  3: 43

discipline that the 21st century makes

  3: 45

more necessary that whole idea of

  3: 51

discipline is one that clearly we have

  3: 58

cast aside except when we're talking

  4: 02

about technological development or

  4: 07

military development and it seems to me

  4: 12

that we need again to recognize that to

  4: 16

develop the best humanity the best

  4: 19

spirit the best community there needs to

  4: 23

be discipline practices of exploring how

  4: 30

do you do that right how do we work

  4: 33

together how do we talk together in ways

  4: 37

that will open up our best capacities

  4: 44

and our best gifts my own feeling like

  4: 48

that I try to shear again and again

  4: 50

question is that when it comes to

  4: 54

creating a multiracial multi-ethnic

  5: 00

multi-religious democratic society we

  5: 06

are still a developing nation we've only

  5: 11

been really thinking about this for

  5: 14

about half a century but my own deep

  5: 17

deep conviction is that the knowledge

  5: 22

like all knowledge is available to us if

  5: 26

we seek it and I think that that the

  5: 30

termination to find a truly democratic

  5: 34

society and to create the truly Beloved

  5: 38

Community

  5: 39

those are things that can be available

  5: 44

to us if we're willing to work with each

  5: 48

other and work with the universe on

  5: 52

developing them they don't come free and

  5: 56

easy they are tough tough tasks for us

  6: 01

to take on
