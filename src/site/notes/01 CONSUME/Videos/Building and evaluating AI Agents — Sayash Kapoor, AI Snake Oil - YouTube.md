## Description

Is 2025 the year of AI agents? Will reasoning models allow agents to solve challenging open problems? From software engineering to web task automation, it has been claimed that agents will solve challenging open problems. Unfortunately, current agents suffer from many shortcomings that reduce their utility in real-world tasks — look no further than Rabbit R1 and the Humane Pin. In this talk, we will explore how current agents fall far short of their claimed performance in the real world and understand best practices for improving agent evaluation. Learn how to avoid known pitfalls and build AI agents that actually matter.
