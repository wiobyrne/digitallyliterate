# Vincent Harding — Is America Possible

![Vincent Harding — Is America Possible?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUjkW8YofNs?start=21)

## Description

In an unsettled political moment, the late, great civil rights elder Vincent Harding is a voice of calm, wisdom, and perspective. He was wise about how the civil rights vision might speak to 21st-century realities. Just as importantly, he pursued this by way of patient yet passionate cross-cultural, cross-generational relationship. He reminded us that the civil rights movement was spiritually as well as politically vigorous; it aspired to a "beloved community," not merely a tolerant integrated society. He posed and lived a question that is freshly in our midst: Is America possible? (Original Air Date: February 24, 2011)

About the Guest:
Vincent Harding taught at Iliff School of Theology. He authored the magnificent book “Hope and History: Why We Must Share the Story of the Movement” and the essay “Is America Possible?”

## Transcript

## Introduction

  0: 00

Vincent Harding is the voice I want to hear this week the conversation I had

  0: 05

with him before his death at 82 in 2014 ever after changed the way I think about

  0: 10

our democratic experiment he was a leading figure in the civil rights movement and he was wise about how the

  0: 17

civil rights vision might speak to 21st century realities just as importantly

  0: 22

Vincent Harding pursued this by way of patient yet passionate cross-cultural

  0: 27

cross-generational relationship the civil rights movement he reminded us was

  0: 33

spiritually as well as politically vigorous it aspired to a Beloved Community

  0: 38

not merely a tolerant integrated society Vincent Harding posed and lived a

  0: 44

question that is freshly in our midst again is America possible how do we work

  0: 50

together how do we talk together in ways that will open up our best capacities

  1: 00

and our best gifts my own feeling like that I try to share again and again

  1: 06

question is that when it comes to creating a multiracial multi-ethnic

  1: 16

multi-religious Democratic Society we

  1: 21

are still a developing nation I'm Krista

  1: 26

Tippett and this is on being

## Vincent Harding

  1: 33

Vincent Harding was professor emeritus of religion and social transformation at

  1: 38

the Iliff School of Theology in Denver Colorado I interviewed him in 2011 back

  1: 44

in 1955 he was working towards his master's degree in history in Chicago when the Montgomery bus boycott began

  1: 51

eventually he and a few friends both black and white traveled south to see how they could be of use along the way

  1: 58

they paid a life-changing visit to another young man in his late 20s Martin Luther King jr. Vincent Harding says

  2: 06

that the phrase civil rights never adequately described King's vision or

  2: 11

the human transformation that it stirred King for his part was intrigued by Harding's work with the Mennonites one

  2: 18

of the original peace churches and by the early 1960s Vincent Harding and his late wife Rosemarie had moved to Atlanta

  2: 25

just around the corner from the King's they founded Mennonite house there which helped the civil rights movement develop

  2: 32

its philosophy and its practice of non-violence were you raised Mennonite

## Were you raised Mennonite

  2: 38

no no I had the marvelous fortune gift

  2: 47

blessing of being raised by a mother who

  2: 53

shortly after I was born became a single mother and who had just great hopes for

  3: 03

me and one of the things that my mother wisely did was that she joined a

  3: 13

fascinating little Church in Harlem called Victory Tabernacle seventh-day

  3: 22

Christian Church these were magnificent women and men a mixture of working-class

  3: 30

professional class all kinds of class and they loved me held me recognized

  3: 39

that I had possibilities that I didn't recognize myself at the outset

  3: 46

huh I had to leave them after a while because I come to different conclusions than they did but even after I left what

  3: 55

I found out over the years was that love

  4: 01

Trump's doctrine every time and I'm

  4: 07

still deeply connected to some of the folks that I grew up with in that church

  4: 13

6070 years ago hmm so you know I want to spend most of our time talking about the

## Civility

  4: 20

present day and mom and I want you to bring the fullness of your moral

  4: 25

imagination and spiritual imagination that emerged from all your experiences including of course that and the civil

  4: 31

rights movement a for example one of the words this getting tossed around a lot is civility and civil and I noticed that

  4: 40

you've said you've stated very emphatically that that you think to call that movement that transformation that

  4: 47

you were part of in the 1960s to reduce it to civil rights that civility in that

  4: 53

cases is not a big enough word and you know and I'm what I'm hearing is I have this conversation now as a lot of people

  4: 59

feel like civility is not a big enough word for us right now either so talk to me about that do you any thoughts about

  5: 04

that mm-hmm yes I think that there are many things

  5: 11

that have come to my mind Krista during this discussion that's going on and

  5: 17

interestingly enough I hadn't quite made the connection that you were making now

  5: 24

with my own thought but that's wonderful that's why we need each other I have

  5: 32

felt increasingly that what we are really talking about is not how we can

  5: 40

have more civil conversation but what we're talking about in the context of

  5: 47

our society for one thing is how we can learn how to have a democratic

  5: 55

conversation that is what we need we are absolutely amateurs at this

  6: 03

matter of building a democratic nation made up of many many peoples of many

  6: 11

kinds from many connections and convictions and from many experiences

  6: 19

and to know how after all the pain that we have caused each other how to carry

  6: 26

on democratic conversation that in a sense invites us to hear each other's

  6: 36

best arguments and best contributions so

  6: 42

that we can then figure out how do we put these things together to create a

  6: 48

more perfect union I found that that way you keep pointing

## Religion

  6: 54

for years for decades you know that that asking about how to be democratic is really taking seriously that question of

  7: 00

living into a more perfect union if I find that helpful as a way to open that word up and for me Crysta it also opens

  7: 09

up the question of what does it mean to be truly human democracy is simply

  7: 16

another way of speaking about that question religion is another way of

  7: 23

speaking about that question what is our purpose in this world and is that

  7: 30

purpose related to our responsibilities to each other and to the world itself

  7: 37

all of that seems to me to be a variety

  7: 42

of languages getting at the same reality right and so you mentioned the religious

  7: 50

piece of it and you very strongly make the link in your telling of this the

  7: 55

story of the civil rights movement the the healing link between religion and democratic transformation would you talk

  8: 04

to me about that a little bit about what we've forgotten about the spiritual and religious dimensions of that let's

  8: 10

remember Crysta that that community that helped

  8: 17

to create King and that he then helped to nurture was a community deeply

  8: 26

grounded in the life of religion and

  8: 32

spirituality this was their way of being

  8: 37

for instance everyone near him knew that he took very

  8: 46

seriously this traditional beautiful

  8: 51

terminology when he said that what he was seeking for was not simply equality

  8: 59

or rights but what he was seeking for was the creation of the Beloved

  9: 07

Community that he saw everything that

  9: 13

crushed against our best human development and our best communal

  9: 21

development like segregation like white

  9: 26

supremacy when he moved to break down

  9: 31

those laws those practices he was doing it not simply as an act of civil action

  9: 41

but a deep spiritual responsibility seeing our best possibilities like my

  9: 50

church community saw in me he saw it in this nation people like Jimmy Baldwin

  9: 57

and others Malcolm for a certain time couldn't imagine how Martin could see

  10: 05

those possibilities but I think he was seeing it because he was looking with an

  10: 12

eye that was deeply filled by love and compassion and that high opens us up to

  10: 19

see many things that might otherwise miss woke up this morning

  10: 28

\[Music\]

  10: 33

freedom look up this morning

  10: 39

my stayed on oh I'm Krista Tippett and this

  10: 51

is on being today summoning the wisdom for now of the late civil rights elder Vincent Harding in the decades after the

  10: 58

1960s Vincent Harding wrote a seminal book hope and history why we must share

  11: 03

the story of the movement and he began to bring young people together with elders of the movement he founded the

  11: 09

veterans of Hope Project at the Iliff School of Theology in Denver to institutionalize this work in creative

  11: 15

ways most riveting and instructive for the young as Vincent Harding told it our

  11: 21

stories of how civil rights leaders have worked on society while at the same time

  11: 26

constantly working on themselves still on three I'm a walking and talking

  11: 38

with my mind stayed on freedom holiday

  11: 50

hallelu Hallel

  11: 56

this idea of storytelling and the importance of stories in the importance

## The Importance of Stories

  12: 04

of stories just for human beings in general but in a moment like this in particular comes up so much and yet I

  12: 11

feel like we don't I don't know if this if we don't have the forms for it in this culture or if it's happening under

  12: 18

the surface and not being pointed at I mean you are doing this my own sense to

  12: 25

Christa is that there was something deeply built into us that needs story

  12: 34

itself that story is a source of nurture

  12: 39

that we cannot become really true human

  12: 45

beings for ourselves and for each others without story and to find ways in which

  12: 52

at our to share it to create it to encourage younger people to create their

  12: 58

own story for instance in the work that we do with the veterans of Hope we also

  13: 04

encourage the younger people to find the elders to find the veterans right not

  13: 10

the celebrities not the TV stars but those folks who nobody else knows have

  13: 19

lived such magnificent lives find them and then sit with them and learn how to

  13: 26

ask the right questions so that the opening can take place I think that this

  13: 35

country cannot become its best self

  13: 40

until we find ways more effectively of institutionalizing that process of

  13: 48

sharing the stories of the elders you know when you say that we as human

## We Know What to Do with Stories

  13: 55

beings have a built-in need for stories what your work shows is that we human

  14: 03

beings also know what to do with stories right so that as you say the young people you work with

  14: 09

no to take those stories as tools and pieces of empowerment in this day this

  14: 17

year for their own best work because now

  14: 22

it's a powerful time in this country for

  14: 27

young people and others should be asking the question and what are we for do we

  14: 35

exist for some reason other than competing with China or finding the best

  14: 43

possible technological advances are there some things that are even deeper

  14: 50

that we are meant for meant to be meant to do meant to achieve Jimmy Baldwin

  14: 58

used to like to talk about us achieving ourselves finding who we are what we're

  15: 06

for and making that possible for each other and so we've you're right about

  15: 13

this you know the story just as you were speaking what I was thinking about Krista was when the mother with the baby

  15: 25

at her bosom starts telling stories it

  15: 34

is clearly not just to pass on

  15: 39

information and what I find is that even

  15: 45

in some of the strangest situations most often where I go where I speak where I

  15: 52

share I start out by asking people to tell a little of their stories and it is

  16: 00

amazing what people discover of themselves of their connections of their

  16: 06

community and it's it's wonderful you know I've learned that too to ask

## Hope and History 1990

  16: 12

someone even to tell a little of their story is to give them a gift because we don't get asked that question and we do

  16: 19

learn as much as we tell you know you a very important book hope and history

  16: 26

1990 I believe yeah I think miss have been writing it in the eighties there's

  16: 33

a story you tell that again I felt offered up a really practical image for now um was about you a conversation

  16: 40

encounter you were having a hard neighborhood in Boston and a young man named Daryl yes would you tell that

  16: 47

story about signposts his image of signposts hmm what I remember from that

## signposts

  16: 55

story was that their young friend of mine Eugene rivers young at that time I

  17: 02

guess Jean jeans with Julia Boorstin yeah that that by the way is one of the

  17: 10

characteristics of many of the elders that we have interviewed in the veterans

  17: 16

project that people are persistent that

  17: 22

they go on and on and on something that is not appreciated in this soundbite

  17: 32

society if you don't get a told done accomplished in 10 minutes or 10 days or

  17: 39

even 10 years then you surely give up and turn away but people like Jean and

  17: 47

others grace Boggs is one of the great women who came out of a Chinese ancestry

  17: 59

first generation in this country married eventually a black man from Alabama who

  18: 08

was a union organizer in Detroit and the two of them Grace and Jimmy Boggs became

  18: 17

a tremendous team until Jimmy died some

  18: 22

years ago grace is now 95 and in Detroit

  18: 28

she is one of the primary encouragers of the young people there

  18: 35

not to be swept away by all of the talk

  18: 41

about the end of Detroit's about the

  18: 46

failures of Detroit but she is working with young people to help them to become

  18: 54

those who build again create again well

  18: 59

all of that takes us away from Victorian but also illustrates the story yeah I

  19: 06

met this young man in Eugene's apartment and this young man came up just to sit

  19: 16

next to me because he wanted to talk in a more personal way it turned out that

  19: 22

he was one of the leaders of the drug-running folks at the time but what

  19: 29

he said to me was that he really felt that one of the reasons why he had gone

  19: 36

in the way that he had gone not trying in any way to excuse himself was the

  19: 42

fact that he like many other young people were operating in a situation

  19: 48

where they felt it was just very very dark all around them and what they

  19: 55

needed were as he put it some some signposts some lights that would in

  20: 04

other people's lives live human signposts yes yes that would help them

  20: 12

to see the possibilities for themselves and I've always felt that one of the

  20: 20

things that we do badly in our educational process especially working

  20: 28

with so-called marginalized young people is that we educate them to figure out

  20: 37

how quickly they can get out of the darkness and get into some much more

  20: 44

pleasant situation when what is needed again and again are more

  20: 50

and more people like Jean who will stand in that darkness who will not run away

  20: 58

from those deeply hurt communities and

  21: 03

will open up possibilities that other people can't see and any other way

  21: 10

except seeing it through human beings who care about them and if we teach

  21: 16

young people to run away from the darkness rather than to open up the

  21: 23

light in the darkness to be the candles the signposts then we are doing great

  21: 29

harm to them and the communities that they have come out of I think this word

## elders

  21: 36

signposts in this image of psychosis is really important I think it's an important piece of practical vocabulary

  21: 43

you said a minute ago about elders that what you also tell young people is that they have to find the elders right I

  21: 49

think I've thought a lot over the years about the teaching in the Hebrew Bible

  21: 54

and they tested me that I think has residents across the traditions of developing eyes to see and ears to hear

  22: 00

you think of that is almost a spiritual discipline that the 21st century makes

  22: 05

more necessary that whole idea of

## spiritual discipline

  22: 11

discipline is one that clearly we have

  22: 17

cast aside except when we're talking about technological development or

  22: 26

military development and it seems to me that we need again to recognize that to

  22: 36

develop the best humanity the best spirit the best community there needs to

  22: 43

be discipline practices of exploring how

  22: 50

do you do that how do we work together how to go back to our conversation how

  22: 57

do we talk together in ways that we open up our best capacities and our best

  23: 08

gifts my own feeling that I try to shear again and again question is that when it

  23: 14

comes to creating a multiracial

  23: 21

multi-ethnic multi-religious Democratic Society we are still a developing nation

  23: 32

we've only been really thinking about this for about half a century but my own

  23: 39

deep deep conviction is that the knowledge like all knowledge is

  23: 46

available to us if we seek it the older I get the more I am convinced that that

  23: 56

magnificent madman Jesus was really

  24: 01

talking about something very truthful and powerful when he said you know if

  24: 09

you allow yourself to really hunger and thirst after the right way then if you

  24: 20

will not back off from that hunger and that thirst if you'll just keep after it

  24: 26

then you will find the way you will be filled the way will find you and I think

  24: 32

that that determination to find a truly democratic society and to create the

  24: 40

truly Beloved Community those are things that can be available

  24: 47

to us if we're willing to work with each other and work with the universe on

  24: 55

developing them they don't come free and easy they are tough tough tasks for us

  25: 04

to take on \[Applause\]

  25: 12

we shall not we shall this is the voice

## Mavis Staples

  25: 39

of Mavis Staples one of the people who has Vincent Harding described it saying the way to freedom in the 1960s as well

  25: 47

here in just a minute in creative and profound ways this also included songs like this little light of

  25: 53

mine and kumbaya \[Music\] you can listen again and share this

  25: 59

conversation with Vincent Harding through our website on being org there you can also download this show or my

  26: 06

entire unedited conversation with Vincent Harding it includes much more of his wonderful personal story how his

  26: 13

enjoyment of basic combat training led him to the Mennonites and how he first

  26: 19

met Martin Luther King jr. joking in bed in his pajamas while recovering from a

  26: 24

gunshot wound also more about lesser-known veterans of civil rights veterans of hope as Vincent Harding

  26: 30

called them \[Music\]

## Krista Tippett

  26: 47

just like a tree I'm Krista Tippett on

  27: 03

being continues in a moment

  27: 15

\[Music\]

  27: 24

\[Music\]

  27: 36

I'm Krista Tippett and this is on being today in an unsettled political moment

  27: 41

at the end of a divisive electoral campaign we're invoking the wisdom of the late civil rights elder Vincent

  27: 48

Harding he was a leading figure in the civil rights movement of the 1960s he was also a close friend and occasional

  27: 54

speechwriter to Martin Luther King jr. Vincent Harding posed and lived a

  27: 59

question that is freshly in our midst again is America possible that question

  28: 06

how do we do it is absolutely the question that I think is rising to the

  28: 12

surface past our calls for civil discourse moral imagination but you know

  28: 18

some of the tools you offer up some of the answers to that question are also

  28: 24

quite wonderful I mean the discipline is mixed with the arts and creativity you

  28: 31

talk about your memory of those years of the 60s that hard fight that also

  28: 37

contains so much violence in darkness you say you have a memory of people singing their freedom yes tremendous

## Creativity

  28: 47

creativity that's I am go back to some of the old black preacher

  28: 55

speaker practices by putting letters and

  29: 01

words together when I think about Martin I think about Martin with the three C's

  29: 07

courage compassion and creativity and I

  29: 13

think that the stoking of our creative capacities is one of the jobs that is

  29: 21

still necessary for us I'm always talking to my young hip-hop young people

  29: 30

about the fact that we need some new songs from the hip hop generation that

  29: 38

will speak about the Beloved Community in whatever terminology they choose now

  29: 44

but we need some music that people can join together in to express their great

  29: 50

need and desire for a better world do they engage you in that conversation oh

  29: 57

yes they do we have a fantastic time as

  30: 02

we try to figure out and now what are the new songs and what are the new words

  30: 09

so I mean for instance let me just mention one word that we've been working with lately

  30: 14

I've been on a campaign encouraging people as we think about the Beloved

  30: 21

Community to stop using this word minority mm-hmm that there is something

  30: 29

negative about that terminology because it always suggests that somebody else is

  30: 38

the majority and the fact is that we are all now creating a new majority we are

  30: 48

all part of this Beloved Community in

  30: 53

community the concept of minority simply

  30: 59

doesn't work you don't have a minority in a family right and so we have got to

  31: 05

get new words new songs new possibilities for ourselves and again

## Beloved Community

  31: 11

that that phrase Beloved Community it was this phrase from the gospel which Martin Luther King used so evocatively

  31: 18

to describe that community of the civil rights movement but what you wrote about how this little

  31: 24

light of mine was sung at Selma mm-hmm that rather than saying governor Wallace

  31: 29

give us our freedom it was about singing this little light of mine I'm gonna let

  31: 35

it shine that was that was so much part of the

## Let It Shine

  31: 41

way in which the songs tried to encourage us not simply to be reactors

  31: 50

so that instead of saying you know you honky governor we're gonna you know

  31: 57

you're no good and we're going to do this or that to you the the basic

  32: 05

deepest word was whatever you do we're gonna let our light shine God gave it to

  32: 15

us we're gonna let it shine was the way that the words went and that

  32: 20

determination to make our own action and

  32: 26

our own commitment the focal point rather than a reaction to the moves of

  32: 35

others was I think one the most beautiful things about about the scene

## Betty Mae Fikes

  32: 54

this is the voice of Betty Mae Fikes a teenager at the time and one of the freedom singers the music arm of the

  33: 01

Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee the year this was recorded 1963 she spent three weeks in jail for

  33: 08

singing during the civil rights struggles in Selma \[Applause\]

  33: 18

let me mention another of those songs that recently came up in a New York

## Kumbaya

  33: 25

Times article I don't know if you saw this someone was writing about this

  33: 31

terminology that we've taken about a kumbaya moment where we have made fun in

  33: 37

a way of this whole experience that came

  33: 42

out of the black church of the singing of that song and whenever somebody jokes

  33: 52

about kumbaya my mind goes back to the Mississippi

  34: 03

summer experience where the movement

  34: 09

folks in Mississippi were inviting co-workers to come from all over the

  34: 16

country especially student types to come

  34: 21

and help in the process of voter registration and freedom school teaching

  34: 27

and taking great risks on behalf of the transformation of that state and of this

  34: 35

nation and there were two weeks of orientation the first week was the week

  34: 42

in which Schwerner and Goodman and their

  34: 49

beloved brother Jimmy were there and it

  34: 55

was during the time that they had left the campus that they were first arrested

  35: 03

and released and then murdered and the word came back to us at the orientation

  35: 14

that the three of them had not been heard from and Bob Moses the magnificent

  35: 26

leader of so much of the work in Mississippi got up and told these

  35: 34

hundreds of predominately white young people that if any of them felt that at

  35: 41

this point they needed to return home which of their schools we would not

  35: 48

think less of them at all but would be grateful to them for how far they had

  35: 53

come but he said let's take a couple of hours just for people to spend time

  36: 00

talking on the phone with parents or whoever to try to make this decision and

  36: 05

make it now and what I found as I moved

  36: 11

around among the small groups that began to gather together to help each other

  36: 17

was that in group after group people

  36: 23

were singing Kumbaya come by here my boy

  36: 30

somebody's missing Lloyd come by here we all need you Lord come by here and I

  36: 41

could never laugh at kumbaya moments after that because I saw then that

  36: 50

almost no one went home from there they

  36: 55

were going to continue on the path that they had committed themselves to and a

  37: 02

great part of the reason why they were able to do that was because of the

  37: 07

strength and the power and the commitment that had been gained through

  37: 14

that experience of just singing together

  37: 19

and kumbaya \[Music\]

## Im Krista

  37: 36

\[Applause\] I'm Krista Tippett and this is on being today summoning the wisdom for now of

  37: 44

the late civil rights elder Vincent Harding he was a pivotal figure in that movement of the 1960s and he worked to

  37: 51

bring its lessons usefully and creatively to young people and the rest of us in the present day

  37: 58

Oh

  38: 10

\[Music\]

  38: 17

\[Music\] was listening to the BBC in the recent

  38: 22

weeks and they were you know they're watching us from afar and they were

  38: 27

interviewing a journalist about this moment in American history which seems

  38: 34

very tumultuous and the question was is it really more violent and more

  38: 39

despairing than it's been before or does this happen repeatedly and the comparison was made with the 1960s and

  38: 46

they said look there was a lot of social turmoil then there were assassinations

  38: 52

right I mean many assassinations but um this journalist said and I just want to

  38: 57

know what you think he said that he thought the difference between the 1960s and now was that even though there were

  39: 06

was incredible tumult and violence it was at the very same time a period of

  39: 11

intense hope and people could see that they were moving towards goals and that

  39: 18

that's missing now what do you think about that analysis hmm Crysta I think

  39: 32

that that is such a complicated kind of

  39: 38

issue that I can only pick at it and

  39: 44

tease it out mm-hmm play with it in the best sense of play I think that what I

  39: 55

see now is the fact that all over this

  40: 01

country wherever I go and of course where I go tends to be sort of self

  40: 08

selective because I am most often going

  40: 13

into situations where people are

  40: 19

operating out of a sense of hope and possibility where in their local

  40: 27

situations whether it be Detroit or Atlanta or campus someplace or church community

  40: 35

in Philadelphia that there are women and men and young people who are operating

  40: 42

out of hope my sense is that in the 60s

  40: 48

there was probably a larger kind of canopy of hope that we could see and we

  40: 57

could identify and that people could name and focus on now we are in

  41: 05

particular spots locations sometimes seemingly isolated but I feel that there

  41: 15

are points vocal situations where that

  41: 22

is still available and where people are operating from that so I think that it

  41: 30

is not simply the matter of hope or no hope I have a feeling that one of the

  41: 38

deeper transformations that's going on now is that for the white community of

  41: 49

America there is this uncertainty

  41: 57

growing about its own role its own

  42: 02

control its own capacity to name the

  42: 10

realities that it has moved into a realm

  42: 18

of uncertainty that it did not allow

  42: 23

itself to face before and I think that that's the place that we are in and

  42: 31

that's even more the reason why we've got to figure out what was King talking

  42: 38

about when he was seeing the possibility of a beloved

  42: 45

immunity and recognize that maybe for some of us that cannot come until some

  42: 52

of us realize that we must give up what

  42: 57

we thought was only ours in the building

  43: 02

of a beloved nation can there be a beloved nation why don't we try and see

  43: 10

my country tis of thee sweet land of

  43: 17

liberty \[Music\]

  43: 23

of thee we bout to say there's a

  43: 32

question that you posed in your writing leave person receives is America possible and kind of echoes back to your

  43: 40

assertion that we need more than civil discourse now we need to more fully realize what it means to be a democracy

  43: 47

and I just wonder when you answer that question is America possible what people

  43: 52

come to mind what answers come to mind in the form of the hope that you see embodied one of the great benefits of

  44: 05

living almost to my 80th birthday is the

  44: 11

great privilege of being able to meet and be with all kinds of marvelous

  44: 21

people I spend a lot of my time in places like Philadelphia we're on the

  44: 32

northwest side I've been deeply involved with church community the Methodist

  44: 39

Church led by a magnificent woman pastor

  44: 44

who has embraced the young people of the community in ways that churches often do

  44: 53

not young people who are considered marginalized have become the heart of

  45: 01

her work and they have seen their own

  45: 07

possibilities I remember when a group of them came out to visit us at our project

  45: 15

in Denver they were true Philadelphians

  45: 22

they would dress from the Philadelphia streets they moved like philadelphians

  45: 28

and they ran into some very interesting encounters in in Denver but at one point told them

  45: 38

one young man one young woman took me aside and said could we talk to you for

  45: 44

just a minute and they had started to call me uncle Vincent and they said to

  45: 52

mean Uncle Vincent why do you love us so and what I saw was that they had this

  46: 07

great capacity to know that they were being loved to feel it in their being

  46: 15

and through later conversation that we had to recognize that that meant they

  46: 23

had power and responsibility to do something for their community that had

  46: 29

not been done for them I see young people like that all over this country

  46: 37

and I know that they exist I know some

  46: 44

of the adults who work with them in places like Greensboro North Carolina in

  46: 50

Detroit Michigan on the reservations in

  46: 55

New Mexico out in the LA area we've got working connections with young people

  47: 03

and their adult nurturers in all of those kinds of situations and because I

  47: 11

see that feel that receive their returning love I know they are capable

  47: 19

of building the Beloved Community and so

  47: 26

it is that kind of constant engagement

  47: 32

with people who have been considered hopeless useless purposeless just like I

  47: 42

saw them in the deep south people who considered backward unable to do

  47: 51

anything became the creators of a new possibility for the whole nation and

  47: 59

when I think about Tiananmen Square and

  48: 04

Prague I realized that those folks in Mississippi and Alabama who were

  48: 11

considered useless were able to speak to the world I see that again and again and

  48: 20

again right in this country see it with young people see it with those who are

  48: 27

loving them into new possibilities and so that's why for me the only answer

  48: 34

that I can give to the question that I raise is yes as we make it possible yes

  48: 42

yes Vincent Harding was chairperson of

## Veterans of Hope Project
