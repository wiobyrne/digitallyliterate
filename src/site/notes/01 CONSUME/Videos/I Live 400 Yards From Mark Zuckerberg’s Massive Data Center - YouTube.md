## Description

What's the true cost of the AI revolution and who should be paying for it? We went to Georgia to find out. 

Demand for data centers is booming as ChatGPT and other AI tools become integrated into our daily life. Under the Trump administration, investments into data centers in the U.S. is expected to surpass $1 trillion in the next five years.

But data centers put extraordinary demand on the power grid and require entirely new infrastructure. In the next three years, data center use of electricity is expected to double or even triple.

We went to rural Georgia, the state with the fastest data center growth in the country, and spoke with residents who are living next to massive data centers owned by Meta and Blackstone and facing nonstop noise, pollution and rapidly rising electricity bills.
