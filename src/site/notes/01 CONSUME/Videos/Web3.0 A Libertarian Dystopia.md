In today’s video I’m looking into all the hype surrounding Web3, blockchain technology, NFTs, and trying to work out WHY this is all happening. The Folding Ideas video ‘Line Goes Up’ came out as I was researching this, and I found that even though we had come to the same conclusion on many aspects of this, I actually came to a different conclusion as to why I think this is all happening - and it’s much more dystopian than most people think. This technology is dangerous and could ruin people’s lives in more ways than just losing out on their investments when the bubble deflates or pops. I have found that many people on the left don’t like this technology but they’re not quite sure why - so my video focusses more on how Bitcoin in particular has strong ties to far-right extremism which was birthed out of the Great Depression in the 1930s, and how the extremely libertarian & conservative Ethereum founder, Peter Thiel, wants to harvest data for the purposes of governing society with rigid code, and he’s getting Jordan Peterson to help.

## Intro

0:00

The year is 2063. The global currency is moosecoin.

0:06

You’re refused entry into the Metaverse’s Lambo club because your Twitter profile picture is not enclosed in an icosahedron.

0:12

In a desperate bid to hold onto a square of pixels, or “land”, you bought in “Elontopia”,

0:19

you must pay rent to Paris Hilton, who bought 17 billion dollars worth of “real estate”

0:25

with a picture of a monkey in 2033, and in a bid to become immortal, has since replaced

0:30

all of her organs with bionic hardware, each limb operated by its own separate smart contract.

0:37

Citizens who hold ‘Sliving’ tokens now have voting rights on her every move - from cooking mediocre lasagnes to overthrowing what is left of democracy.

0:46

Jobs are obsolete and by the time you get to the MetaWalmart, Moosecoin has crashed.

0:51

Don’t take the goggles off.

0:57

NEVER TAKE the goggles off.

1:05

But it’s ok - because you’re in “control” of who has your data now, and your dirty fiat

1:14

currency didn’t devalue by 2% over the entire year. That might be what happens if Web3 actually takes off.

1:22

But it seems… that for some reason, people actually want to stop this from happening?

1:28

Welcome back to the münecat channel. Are you ready for another rabbit hole that would confuse the shit out of a small Victorian

1:35

child? Oh and if you’re a crypto bro watching this video - yes. I’m about to FUD.

1:42

I’m gonna FUD sooooo hard. To understand the intention behind “Web3”, you need to understand “Web1” and “Web2”.

1:52

Those of you who don’t have back problems might not remember “Web1”.

1:58

Let Grandma müne explain. It involved: Neopets Netscape browsers Dedicating half of your deskspace to your CRT monitor

2:08

Watching Napster take 3 hours to download the latest New Found Glory pop punk hit in 96 kbps, only to open it and find out it’s 2 girls 1 cup

2:19

Physical fights with siblings over who gets to use the landline Hampster Dance dot com Chain emails that threatened you with a 7-year

2:26

curse Janky browsers on your Sony Ericsson flip phone “You’ve Got Mail” - it’s a hyperlink

2:32

to Goatse! Signing in and out of MSN Messenger to try and get the attention of …Brandon

2:38

Windows XP Writing surreal erotic fanfiction on the Good Charlotte forum with your emopunk friends You can hear the modem scream

2:47

Yahoo! Malware Geocities Meatspin But then... Web2 came along.

2:53

Ugh. Now we have: Google Facebook Javascript Google Amazon Cookies

2:59

Google Facebook Data harvesting Facebook Amazon Google Who put Bing there?

3:07

Google Facebook But many people think there’s something new on the horizon.

3:12

Something to break us free from these large corporations and eliminate the “middle man”.

3:18

And that’s… the blockchain. Now, how am I going to explain blockchain technology without making you all want to

3:26

stab yourselves in the eyeballs? I’m gonna have to Margot Robbie it, right?

3:35

I don’t have a butler, ok.

3:45

Or a champagne flute.

3:51

Blockchain technology is a bit like \*sigh\* - imagine there was a really, easy, quick

3:57

way of making payments called - I dunno - VISA, right. But you thought - ‘hey - why don’t we replace this system with something else that

4:06

doesn’t involve a ‘middle man’ - right - because that’s a problem that needs solving

4:11

\- and replace it with a system that uses more power than the Netherlands! Say you want to pay 1 queefcoin to Tracey.

4:19

But instead of your phone sending 1 message to your bank, the bank checks the funds and

4:24

then sends the funds to Tracey, your phone sends a message to a few hundred thousand

4:30

people idling extremely powerful computers 24/7 playing a sort of extreme bingo and once

4:38

one of the computers wins, the block of payments gets added to a ledger and this creates a

4:44

blockchain… and the correct guesser gets a little reward of a fraction of a queefcoin.

4:52

And then 10 minutes and 400kg of CO2 later, if you’re lucky, and Tracey hasn’t lost

4:58

her pass phrase the silly bitch, she receives her queefcoin.

5:03

But now it’s 10 minutes later, and 1 queefcoin is worth a tenth of what it was when I sent

5:10

it. Or, think of it like this: instead of asking a trusted friend to oversee your queefcoin

5:17

transaction, you say, ‘I would like to send you this queefcoin, but in order to do so,

5:22

I cannot put my trust into this “friend”, eurgh, so instead I will put my trust in thousands

5:29

of strangers on a ‘decentralised network’ that are actually mostly controlled by random

5:34

millionaire tech nerds that own a loads of shipping containers full of Nvidia graphics

5:39

cards in Siberia and why don’t I burn down a forest at the same time just for the fucking

5:47

hell of it?’ Yeah, it doesn’t sound like it makes a lot of sense, and that’s because it fucking

5:53

doesn’t. This technology has been around since the 2008 market crash, touted as a ‘solution

6:01

to the problem of the banking system’, but hasn’t really caught on much outside of purchasing black market goods, money laundering and tax evasion - this left a few “whales”

6:11

holding a large portion of the available computer coins - but in order to cash out without making a huge loss, they’d need to find other people who were willing to pay more for their fake

6:21

computer coins than they paid for it originally. But where were they going to find the silly little suckers to provide this much needed

6:28

liquidity? Cryptocurrency needed a marketing strategy to make it a bit less black tar heroin, and

6:40

a little bit more …Disney. Enter NFTs. Why don’t you funge this you pussy-ass hexagon bitch

## NFTs

6:48

When’s the last time you made a girl twitch?

6:53

The art market loves rich people. For obvious reasons. And rich people love art.

6:59

For obvious reasons. For many decades, the art world and the billionaire world have enjoyed a beautiful symbiotic relationship

7:09

wherein an artist has a work ‘valued’ by a ‘museum’ or a ‘collector’ for

7:14

millions and millions of dollars, the billionaire will buy the work, the artist gets some cash,

7:20

and because the billionaire liked the art so, so, much, they get to keep it offshore

7:27

locked away in a freeport, because they can’t even bear to look at it.

7:33

Or pay any taxes on it. It’s just so beautiful and profound, it’s impossible to pay tax on it.

7:44

But… interestingly… this is all about to change. Auction houses have enjoyed decades of not having to give a fuck about facilitating money

7:52

laundering, because when a Tony Soprano character comes in, you know, nobody don’t have to

7:57

tell no one where that money come from, and nobody get whacked, you know, it’s like an unwritten agreement, you know, uh, wink and a nudge, a suitcase full of cash, 5 mil

8:08

for an andy warhol, don’t worry bout it, it’s no one’s business, capeesh, and bada

8:13

bing, bada boom, everybody wins. I don’t know what that accent was. But oh no!!

8:20

In December of 2020, US congress passed a new legislation that went into effect at the

8:27

end of 2021, and the EU passed legislation at the start of 2020 - making it much more

8:34

difficult to hide where your dirty suitcase of fiat money came from. And, in perfect synergy, like star crossed lovers, the art market and silicon valley

8:45

tech nerd billionaires with their fake computer money in need of a crypto marketing strategy

8:52

found each other. Just like an MLM, you need to give your scam a ‘product’ in order to give it a facade

8:58

of legitimacy and real ‘value’, and not simply a mechanism to funnel even more money

9:05

to the top 1%. And it’s pretty fucking simple, really. Say you’re one of these whales holding some illiquid ether.

9:14

You have large investments in various crypto projects and you’d reeeeally like them to

9:19

take off, and it would also be lovely if you could get more people to buy ether at the same time, allowing your company stonk and your personal stonks to stonk.

9:30

So say you approach a famous digital artist, maybe that digital artist is called Beeple,

9:37

and you say: “Hey, did you know the ethereum blockchain and decentralised economies are the future? I have a DAO on the ethereum blockchain.

9:42

Why don’t you stitch a load of your pictures together, mint it as an non-fungible token on OpenSea and I’ll buy it with some ether, then the news outlets will shit their pants

9:49

man, and everyone will realise how awesome NFTs are and that this is definitely the future of digital ownership.”

9:54

“What the fuck are you talking about?” “Dude I have billions stuck in the computer.

10:00

I can’t get it out. I need the money that’s stuck in the computer.” “I still don’t understand.”

10:07

“You get $69 million dollars”. “In hard cash?”

10:12

“Yes.” “USD?” “Yes.” “OK”. It worked In March 2021, in the NFT mania that followed,

10:21

ether’s value skyrocketed along with this businessman’s company, effectively allowing

10:26

him to immediately make all of his jpg money back an estimated 5 times over, and on top,

10:33

got free marketing for his magic computer money wallet company - which is now acting

10:39

as a sort of mortgage bond provider - but for NFTs - WHICH WILL DEFINITELY END WELL.

10:46

There’s a bubble. And the craze had only just begun. Bored Ape Yacht Club and CryptoPunks were among the first NFT collections to capitalise

10:54

on the hype right after the Beeple sale - and in my opinion - the only reason they did so

11:00

well was simply due to being in the right place, at the right time. And something tells me that the project has since been…

11:07

I dunno… rushed somewhat. No humans detected. One of these characters was sold for nearly 15 thousand dollars.

11:16

For that much, I’d want the ape to climb out of the screen like the girl in the ring.

11:22

My cholesterol’s gonna go up after this. But this is meant to be the “utility” of this project.

11:28

This is what it’s all “for”, right.This is the “value”. Yet there’s barely any interest in it apart from people hate-watching it.

11:36

They have a lofi livestream as well, which regularly clocks all of around 5 viewers.

11:42

But yeah, UTILITY, guys. Speculative early adopters of the Bored Ape Yacht Club and CryptoPunks NFTs got lucky

11:51

\- and we’ve had to put up with a torrent of cringe ever since.

12:02

NFT collections which were already doing well were further pumped by other grifters who

12:10

wanted to artificially pump the prices of other projects in order to increase the legitimacy

12:16

of their own. And that brings us to one villain of the münecat cinematic universe, Gary Vee.

## Gary Vee's NFTs

12:23

And we know exactly how he did this, thanks to this crypto-bro-circle-jerk conversation between Mr Beast, seasoned pumper-and-dumper Logan Paul.

12:31

Suck my dink, bro Dink? and Logan Paul’s side… bro…

12:36

Dink doink. With the hottest functionality. And all of the most built-in techniques, tactics.

12:42

Gary Vee. It’s like fucking 11pm. Just out of nowhere. Just calls me and he’s like ‘Yo I got like 30 people on a call hop in’.

12:49

So me and Logan both bought punks. You guys probably seen on his twitter. He bought a bunch of cryptopunks at the same time.

12:55

He’s like ‘It’ll be the best decision of your life just get in’. Yeah. Ok. Yeah.

13:00

And so I just joined the call. Every heavy hitter you could imagine worth a billion dollars was on this one call. Here’s what you’re gonna do and you’re gonna do it right now.

13:05

You’re all gonna buy a bunch of cryptopunks. We’re all just like ‘are you sure Gary?’ And we’re asking questions and he’s just like ‘just buy’.

13:12

I dunno. I was just so pulled by his, like, conviction. Yeah. I bought a bunch.

13:17

Yeah I bought quite a few. What’s your rarest characteristic punk? Well I've already sold quite a few of them. So I don’t know.

13:23

What? He was preaching about blockchain jpgs to Logan Paul and Mr Beast at 11pm.

13:32

No wonder his wife left him. Gary Vee’s plan successfully persuaded multiple millionaires to buy ether, and then buy CryptoPunks

13:41

with that ether - because apparently CryptoPunks are the “new Facebook guys”, because Gary

13:48

Vee’s entire career is basically built around reminding people about that one time he was right and using that to make it look like he always knows what the next big thing is.

13:56

He then convinced these millionaires to immediately flip the NFTs and buy his own blockchain scribbles

14:03

instead with the proceeds. So then I rolled the money into VeeFriends cause Gary, same thing, called me he’s like

14:09

‘VeeFriends’. Now one thing we know about Gary Vee is that his poor fans aren’t worth a lot to him,

14:15

because he can’t charge them ten grand a meeting, and then use that meeting for the purposes of extracting further money out of them.

14:23

There’s no “utility” in poor fans. Ok? Apart from when you’re shouting vague motivational buzzwords at them and uploading that to social

14:31

media. Ok? So how does he solve the problem of the vast majority of his fans being broke as shit?

14:38

Through various complex NFT schemes of course, and because no one is familiar with the grift

14:44

yet, the space is rife for exploitation. First of all, he gets his millionaire friends to pay over the odds for his scribbles, artificially

14:53

inflating the price, something in the real world we know as “painting the tape”, which is an illegal activity.

14:59

He’s not the only one recreating actions that would be considered fraud in the real world, as over 80% of trades on LooksRare platform were found to be wash trading, which

15:10

is the practice of selling assets to yourself to artificially inflate the price.

15:15

Then, once his impressionable fans see that his scribbles are selling for astronomical

15:21

prices, they all get sad because they can’t afford them, and they’re ‘FOMO’ing hard. So what does Gary do to make it look like he’s super generous and inclusive?

15:30

Well, he releases a new book, and tells them all to buy 12 physical copies - they had to

15:36

be the physical copies - and then you get 1 free ‘Book Friends’ collection NFT,

15:42

(which he doesn’t bother pumping with his millionaire friends, because what’s the point, they’ve already bought the fucking books).

15:49

Meanwhile, Gary’s new book becomes a bestseller before release. Gary’s fans list the spare books on ebay hoping to sell them at half price, and some

16:00

even start burning them in furnaces to keep warm because they can’t afford heating anymore.

16:05

So, holders of the VeeFriends NFTs (not the Book NFTs, they’re in a separate collection,

16:11

this one isn’t for the poors hahaha) get to attend VeeCon 2 whole times. VeeCon is a special event in which you sit in a conference hall repeatedly picturing

16:20

your closest family members being shot directly in the fucking face, and realising that that

16:26

would actually be a more pleasurable experience than being subjected to people like Charlie

16:32

and Dixie D’Amelio, Faze Banks and Logal Paul for an entire fucking weekend.

16:40

so he’s essentially holding an auction to see himself live, and separate auctions to actually meet him, and go bowling with him.

16:49

Imagine someone like Britney Spears - instead of selling tickets at a fixed price on a first-come-first-served

16:55

basis, she auctioned seats for her concerts. Who would end up going to Britney Spears concerts?

17:02

Rich fans. This is generally seen in the live music industry as unethical - artists don’t want to be

17:10

seen to be prioritising rich fans over poor fans. Gary Vee, on the other hand, has found a way around appearing unethical - to guarantee

17:19

that only his wealthiest fans are closest to him at all times. Gary then pursued a new NFT project - in which only holders of his most prestigious scribbles

17:31

are granted access to a 5-star seafood restaurant. Oh, but don’t worry, broke Gary Vee fans, you get to hang out with Gary too now!!

17:41

As long as you rent an NFT from his wealthier fans, thereby funnelling more money up to his wealthier fans, and allowing Gary to extract more value from said wealthier VIP fans as

17:50

a result. Gosh, this is sounding an awful lot like a scheme structured like a sort of inverted

17:57

funnel, doesn’t it? Oh, and don’t worry, Gary has ensured he received 10% of the proceeds of all VeeFriends

18:04

NFT resales, so he doesn’t miss out on any of the sweet revenue garnered from his wealthiest

18:11

fans bidding to the death to smell his sigma sushi farts. Meanwhile, as the NFT market’s grift-a-thon was in full cringe, it only made the Bored

## Celebrity NFTs

18:21

Apes project look more “legit” in comparison, and it continued to increase in value, which

18:28

eventually culminated in the pinnacle of cringe earlier this year, where celebrity millionaires

18:34

got horny on main for ‘painting the tape’ and literally painted all types of tape on

18:40

Twitter and even on fucking late night TV. Nevermind the unfathomable cringe of this clip - this is at best undisclosed advertising,

18:51

and at worst a fucking crime. That’s your ape? Yeah it’s really cool. We’ll debut it.

18:56

The hat, the shades. How did you pick?

19:01

And it probably won’t surprise you to learn that all of these celebrities have financial interests or are affiliated with the same talent agency which has an investment in OpenSea.

19:12

Someone even did an Always-Sunny-style chart mapping all the business relationships together like a rat king of clout, dirty money and cringe. So you know how people play video games for fun? Well NFT enthusiasts want to end that.

19:21

Another NFT shill scheme is the gamification of the links to the jpegs.

## Play-to-earn NFTs

19:28

Axie Infinity has become the most popular Play-to-Earn game, in which you buy an NFT

19:35

of an Axie, and you can fight it sort-of Pokemon style. Stories about players in the Philippines being able to Axie their way out of poverty are

19:44

heartwarming - and probably are in some way written or sponsored by people invested in

19:50

crypto, because all ethics in journalism seem to go by the wayside as soon as a blockchain is involved.

20:57

Oh, really, let’s dig into the numbers then and try and mine some sense out of this, shall we, because this entire video has been extremely vague about where the actual money is coming

21:08

from here. To even start playing Axie Infinity, you need to buy a team of 3 Axie NFTs - which are $200

21:16

dollars each. But don’t worry if you can’t afford that - you can just become a “scholar”, and

21:22

rent an Axie from a sort of, I dunno, Axie landlord? What is up Youtube Bryson here and today I’m gonna be giving you my advice on how to earn

21:31

a scholarship in Axie Infinity. Then, you can grind and grind and grind for hours on the game (but don’t forget to have

21:39

fun now), and your “manager” sits around taking a large percentage of your earnings.

21:46

Yet when this system is in a game, and absolutely no value is created whatsoever,

21:53

well, yes, you guessed it, it relies on bringing more people into the system at the bottom.

22:00

This carries on until there’s an inevitable crash, and those kids in the Philippines start earning below minimum wage.

22:07

Not quite so fucking heartwarming now, is it, Mark Cuban. Impressively, Axie Infinity managed the incredible feat of creating an amalgamation of all the

22:17

worst parts of late stage capitalism in one: a pyramid scheme structure, rentism and the

22:24

bullshit job phenomenon - in which everyone has become so obsessed with tying their self-worth

22:29

to the work that they do, that they disassociate the work from the actual value created.

22:36

The kid in the Philippines fighting cartoons with each other - bullshit job. The woman on the Apprentice who sits in an office in front of a fake spreadsheet all

22:43

day just for Alan Sugar to call her once a week to ask the contestants to come through to the boardroom - bullshit job.

22:49

Yet our obsession with the 5-day work week has caused us to justify doing “work” for no reason and Jeremy Corbyn was right, motherfuckers, but you’re too busy rimming

22:59

capitalism to notice you could be working less. Artists who have made money out of this trend are now successfully converted into automatic

## NFT marketing works exactly like MLMs

23:06

NFT shills, putting .eth at the end of their Twitter screen names, such as musician RAC.

23:13

He reckons that if he’s being “exploited”, then he’d like to be “exploited” more, please.

23:19

And he also reckons that if you squint hard enough, the stock market and the US dollar

23:24

is also a Ponzi scheme! (A common tactic of crypto shills is to strip the phrase ‘Ponzi scheme’ of all of its

23:32

meaning). It’s not hard to see where he’s coming from since, like many musicians, he’s been

23:37

fucked over by music labels and streaming platforms his entire career, and the one time

23:43

he’s made money has been through selling his music as this speculative asset. Beyond that, however, he’s extremely vague about how this is supposed to work - but he

23:52

seems convinced this is the solution for small-time artists barely making any money from their

23:58

work. Trouble is, this logic is entirely flawed. RAC was able to make money through already having a platform.

24:06

And that’s the only real scarcity at play here - attention. Here’s a graph showing the median prices of sales in primary sales of NFT collections

24:16

over a 1 week ‘gold rush’ period. Looks pretty good, at a glance, right?

24:23

Until you realise the y axis is a fucking logarithmic scale.

24:28

Here it is on a normal scale. 34% of these collections made $100 or less, which means that after various fees, they

24:35

actually lost money. 20% made less than $92 after fees, and 11% made a whopping $223 after fees, and so on.

24:45

That’s for an entire collection of NFTs - which could be anything up to around 10,000

24:52

jpegs. And it’s funny that you really have to dig to find this information - kind of like how

24:59

you have to dig to find the income disclosure statement of any MLM.

25:04

If people were really making money - surely marketplaces like OpenSea would be shouting

25:11

from the fucking rooftops about their stats - instead, and just like MLMs, they’re hyperfocusing

25:17

their marketing on the few people at the top making millions. And loads of those sales are probably wash trades anyway.

25:24

And that’s not even mentioning all of the artists that have had their artwork stolen

25:29

and minted. And OpenSea got so many takedown requests - they ended up just stopping processing them.

25:37

GREAT SYSTEM, GUYS. The only people who win here are the 1% of artists with existing large audiences who

25:44

actually make a profit, but that’s still crumbs in comparison to ether whales, who

25:50

not only profited from the influx of buyers of ether, but also profited from the minting

25:56

fees of NFTs that didn’t even sell, or lost money. They profited from everyone.

26:02

And, then, of course, we had the influencer shitcoin epidemic.

## Influencers and Poocoins, Securities Fraud

26:11

My baby left my heart broken Told me to invest in his ICO token

26:21

Said he loved me to the moon But he rug pulled He drained my heart’s liquidity pool

26:28

27:34

Influencers got a terrible bout of shitcoin diarrhoea and sprayed it all into the toilet

27:40

bowl of social media and now the plumbing is clogged. And it’s not surprising this happened, because - well - crypto has allowed this to become

27:50

extremely easy. All you have to do is go on a site like CoinTool.App, go to Create Token, choose which blockchain

28:00

you want it to sit on, give it a name like ElonMoonDogeSpongeSafeMusk, make the initial

28:06

coin supply about 69,420 trillion if you want, then because there’s so many coins, whatever

28:12

the market cap is you can just make the buy-in price for 1 coin look dirt cheap.

28:19

Then, you want your mates to make a load of money too, right, so you do a whitelist - and basically give a load of tokens to your mates so they can get them for a cheaper price and

28:26

save on gas fees before they’re released to your idiot fans. “Users who make the whitelist and later sell their newly-minted NFT gain a profit

28:32

75.7% of the time, versus just 20.8% for users who do so without being whitelisted, Chainalysis

28:39

said, citing Opensea data. The data suggests it’s nearly impossible to reap outsized returns on minting purchases

28:46

without being whitelisted.” So then you end up with instagram models who have pivoted their entire careers to being

28:51

NFT influencers, living off being on NFT drop whitelists, using their platforms to shill

28:58

them to their pleb followers as if the project’s got an ‘amazing roadmap’, and bank on the fact that your followers are stupid enough to be too distracted by tits to even notice

29:08

the rugpull. It’s your favourite cryptoqueen I’ve just invested in Koinu Unu and I’m super excited

29:14

because they’re starting a gaming platform. As always this is not financial advice I’m just letting you know what I’m investing

29:22

in. Hi guys, so ‘hashtag ad’ but this is not financial advice, but I just wanted to tell

29:30

you about titty-asscoin. I’m hodling this one guys, I know the last 79 coins I’ve told you about did crash,

29:39

but they were not financial advice, so, I’m apeing in right now, I don’t know if you’ve

29:49

seen the roadmap but it looks just like the Nickelodeon Universe park map so you know it’s gonna be good.

29:56

In fact, I think it might actually be the Nickelodeon Universe park map with crypto

30:02

buzzwords scribbled on top? But that doesn’t matter guys, because we’re all gonna make it this time.

30:11

I’ve spoken to the dev team on the project and one of them, like, has a ponytail, and

30:21

the other knows basic html, and everyone in the Discord is either a bot or is showing

30:26

signs of extreme cognitive impairment, so, that’s also a good sign.

30:34

Get in now! Not financial advice. And if you can’t even be arsed to make the project look legit enough to get it on a semi-legit

30:43

exchange like Coinbase, just slap it on Pancakeswap and get a bot to post about it to Reddit every

30:50

3 minutes. But of course, Coinbase eventually realised that being semi-responsible about the coins

30:56

they allowed people to list on their exchange meant they were losing customers to competitors,

31:01

so they changed their tune, and now they’re basically the same as Pancakeswap, so that’s

31:07

cool, people are literally left to ‘do your own research’ now when investing in a coin. And that never goes wrong.

31:19

In the end, the whole scheme can cost you about $450. And that’s how influencers like Ice Poseidon, with a brain so smooth you could use it as

31:28

a curling stone, managed to shamelessly fleece his audience out of half a million dollars.

31:34

Yeah I could give the money back, it is within my power, erm, but I’m gonna look out for

31:39

myself and not do that. I don’t know what else to say it’s just the most honest answer.

31:46

It’s like Bernie Madoff literally went and made a paint-by-numbers Ponzi scheme for children.

31:52

Literally, Ryan’s Toy Reviews could do it and probably make enough money to turn the

31:57

entire world into a mystery egg if he wanted to. I just want my money back!

32:04

Investing your money into an influencer’s shitcoin is called, in the cryptoverse, an

32:09

‘ICO’. It’s basically like investing in an IPO on the stock market - but with no securities

32:14

regulations that require the company to be registered with the SEC with complete information

32:20

about the people running the organisation known to the buyer, and all of the risks clearly

32:25

spelled out. Any company that IPOs has a huge document written out my multiple lawyers which the

32:31

hedge funds and investors will get their lawyers to look through before ‘apeing in’. But crypto means that any career fraudster can now, in effect, pop an IPO on the market

32:42

completely anonymously and without consequence. And before I get hoards of people in the comments going ‘but the SEC sucks, dude!’

32:50

\- yes, it does. They often resort to fining scammers after the scam has happened - because investigating

32:57

them costs a lot of money, and it might not always turn out to be a crime. But they are perpetually stuck in this impossible balancing act between preventing fraud and

33:07

not “stifling creativity” in the finance sector. So right now they’re stuck in a crippling epidemic of ponzi schemes within ponzi schemes,

33:17

and of course the people benefitting from all of this fraud are the people going to the regulators and saying ‘yo, this is just innovation dude.

33:26

Don’t stifle innovation, man!’ Er where do companies draw the line and say that enough is enough with this anti-innovation

33:36

quote regulation by enforcement and then just decide to take their industry elsewhere to

33:42

another country? There’s something about crypto that scares people. I don’t know what it is. Maybe it’s just because it’s new.

33:48

I remember my banking law class when banks were first allowed to use computers to keep ledgers, people were sued over that at the time.

33:55

I remember when I was a second year lawyer and we got email and the ABA said lawyers couldn't use email because it would travel over this mysterious network of computers.

34:04

These all seem ridiculous today. It seems like we haven’t really learned the underlying lessons, which is technology

34:10

usually advances human flourishing, we have a regulatory system, let’s use it. The exact same thing happened when they allowed Bernie Madoff to run a ponzi scheme for thirty

34:20

years. Yes, it went on for THIRTY years. During which he was reported to the SEC multiple times.

34:28

He actually did innovate some methods that are still used in finance to this day - but that doesn’t negate the fact that he stole $64.8 billion dollars.

34:39

The same happened with the crash in 08, the same with Enron, the SEC knew of the signs,

34:45

but didn’t do anything. And these crypto shills and right wing politicians are now trying to demonise the SEC - not for

34:52

doing too little, but for doing too much. And the crypto market is currently in this perfect sweet spot in which lobbying from

35:00

billionaire Silicon Valley investors can successfully convince regulators that this is actually

35:05

the ‘future’ and all of this scamminess is just a symptom of ‘new tech’, and they’d

35:10

better not put too much regulation on it or all of the business of this exciting new tech will move abroad.

35:16

There are some products which are legal in other countries and are just not legal here. We do not allow that in the United States.

35:22

We do allow it in Canada. We allow it in Germany, Singapore, Portugal and a number of other places.

35:27

So if you’re a developer of those products, there’s no fuzzy line. It's super clear - you can’t do that here, so you have to go abroad.

35:33

So we’re behind the curve? Unquestionably. And because most of the regulators haven’t a fucking clue what a blockchain is, or have

35:41

even caught up with what web2 is doing yet - Will you commit to ending finsta?

35:47

There’s a rush to pocket as much cash as possible before any real restrictions are

35:52

put into place. And who loses out? The retail investor. Again. At best, at this point I think we’ll end up with crypto stuck in legal limbo between

36:01

lobbyists and regulators, similar to MLMs, who got subjected to ‘regulations’ which

36:07

are supposed to require recruits make more money from selling the products than from recruiting people, but these rules are not properly enforced and the grift continues,

36:16

and they can even use the fact that they’re ‘legal’ to differentiate themselves from

36:21

other MLMs who have been prosecuted under the law for being pyramid schemes.

36:27

It just gives the ones who didn’t get caught more power. And I’m sure you’ve all probably seen this by now, but if there was one video in

36:36

the world that would make you want to take all the cash out of your wallet right now, roll it up into a tight little tube and stick your cock right down the middle and scream

36:46

“fiat me daddy”, it’s Cryptoland. Take a shot every time you hear the word crypto.

## Cryptoland

36:53

This is me. Christopher. A crypto degen with a crush for crypto-kitties. I’m on my way to Cryptoland. The number 1 crypto destination on earth where crypto enthusiasts or Cryptolanders like we’re

37:03

called here, can meet with like-minded individuals in real life. No, you haven’t taken a drug spiked with the source code of the Reddit homepage.

37:10

This is real. I’ve unfortunately immersed myself so deep into crypto world that I now understand every

37:17

fucking joke in this video. And they’re not funny. They’re not funny at all.

37:26

Its creator had a vision of “Disneyland for Crypto”, but it ended up looking more

37:31

like they fed an AI bot with those randomly generated animated kids channels on Youtube,

37:38

and your nightmares, and it spat out 20 minutes of this.

37:44

They enlisted the help of crypto-shill-for-hire Kyle Chasse, who said he bought an NFT which

37:51

was supposed to buy him a plot of land on this island. An island that they didn’t even own.

37:57

He brags that he spent 1.3 million dollars on it on his thumbnail, when in reality some

38:03

crypto-sleuths discovered that the organisers slashed the price in half right before he

38:09

bought it, and changed it back right after. He still paid far too much for it. I actually had some property, should not have bought it, couldn’t have afforded it, sub-prime

38:19

mortgages you know, there’s no loans or lending or sub-prime mortgages or anything like that. And if you’re thinking - how the fuck do people fall for this?

38:28

This insanely fucking stupid. Remember. This marketing is not aimed at you.

38:34

It’s aimed at vulnerable people who have been fucked over hard by capitalism, they

38:39

want friends, a ‘community’, and they want money. And just like MLMs, they have their ways of creating a community atmosphere by talking

38:48

to each other in a sort of ‘code’ and ‘inside jokes’, which this video represents.

38:54

But as soon as you start “FUD”ding, your new “FRENS” are nowhere to be seen. They’re being told that capitalism isn’t the problem - it’s actually the federal

39:04

reserve, big banks and politicians, and they believe it, because along with that story,

39:10

they’re being given an easy way out. It’s the same reason your junk email folder is full of shit that looks like it was written

39:16

by a fat-fingered ape with dyslexia. Don’t ask me how an ape got diagnosed with dyslexia.

39:22

That’s not the point. The bad spelling is on purpose. They want to attract the people who are not put off by spelling mistakes - because the

39:30

people who are put off by spelling mistakes are a waste of their time. You might get a few back and forths from a semi-intelligent person, but once they realise

39:39

what the deal is, they'll bounce, and that was all a waste of your valuable scamming time.

39:45

You need the extremely vulnerable, and only the extremely vulnerable in from the start.

39:52

They won’t waste your time, they’ll agree with everything you say, and be unabashedly

39:57

positive. And they don’t even need to have money, they just need to be the cheerleaders that will convince the people with money to buy in based on hype.

40:06

Discords made for pumping new NFT collections and coins are ideal, because as soon as someone even slightly FUDs, you can immediately boot them out of the server, no questions asked.

40:17

You can also easily convince them to do all of your marketing for you, for free. In the case of Cryptoland, they allowed their recruited cheerleaders to ‘earn’ a free

40:26

NFT if they: Followed the Cryptoland Twitter Turned on tweet notifications Liked all of their tweets

40:32

Retweeted all of their tweets Wrote meaningful tweets about Cryptoland Changed their Discord and Twitter profile pictures to a screenshot of the nightmare

40:39

video, or one of their NFTs Added Cryptolander to their username on Twitter and Discord Added a link to the discord in their twitter

40:44

bio Invited 20 friends to the discord Were a ‘fun and active’ user on the discord All FUDders, and even people merely asking questions or linking to the page which showed

40:54

that the island was still for sale - were immediately banned. The sale of Cryptoland island fell through, thankfully.

41:02

They had plans to make it into a sort of safe haven from the “fiat environment” When you strip all of the fluff words, they basically wanted a libertarian steasted free from those

41:12

pesky taxes and regulations, including the age of consent.

41:18

So how is this being sold to us as the future? Why don’t you come to Cryptopia It’s even worse than Bezostopia

## Web2 vs Web3

41:35

There isn’t even a fucking moose And probably lots of xenophohia The Bitcoin bros come in 2 main groups.

41:43

The ones who believe Bitcoin will eventually wipe out fiat currency - they’re generally

41:48

called maximalists - but we’ll call them maxipads. For fun. Then there’s the other group who believe Bitcoin should be forever used alongside fiat.

41:57

We’ll call them the tampons. Bitcoin will never be widely accepted as a form of currency in businesses until it is

42:06

stable. And it will never be stable until it is widely accepted. And at a large scale, we meet a different issue - the scalability problem.

42:18

If Bitcoin processed all the transactions Visa does today, it will use as much electricity

42:24

as the rest of the world put together, and will be even slower than it is now. And that’s not the only problem.

42:30

So the tampons are essentially arguing for the centralised gateways between fiat and

42:36

crypto to perpetually exist forever because we will always need fiat currency. So in this school of thought, Bitcoin is only useful as a hedge against inflation.

42:46

But the number only goes up because of the speculative belief that Bitcoin will have

42:51

future uses. There is no value in the software code in itself, like there is in gold. So it is a much riskier investment - based on a tech use case.

42:58

And tech investments are inherently risky, especially when you consider the inherent flaws of blockchain technology.

43:05

There are much more stable investments available, such as Stocks and Shares ISAs/Index funds,

43:11

but maybe they have a humiliation kink and love it when the number goes down, I don’t

43:17

know. So the maxipads believe, essentially, that fiat is doomed, long live Bitcoin, to the

43:24

moon, and all that.The following use cases only apply if you never have to involve exchanges

43:30

to fiat currency. Because as long as you still need to involved centralised exchanges, nothing is decentralised.

43:38

But this uptopian view still has inherent flaws.

## Banking the Unbanked

43:44

It really is sweet how so many Reddit bros all of a sudden have huge concern for Ethiopian

43:51

and Nigerian farmers, and I’m sure it has nothing to do with the little graph on their

43:57

Coinbase app. I spent um November 2019 er roaming around the continent of Africa, went to Nigeria,

44:03

went to Ethiopia, Ghana, and I saw that the number one problem that entrepreneurs were

44:08

working there, they were all working on payments and the most interesting of them were working on Bitcoin. Poorer citizens of developing countries are, slowly but surely, getting banked.

44:19

The adoption of mobile money is spreading. Crypto’s Silicon Valley tech CEOs, VCs and Jack Dorsey all have a real sudden charitable

44:29

streak in them in the form of ensuring entrepreneurs in developing countries can find a way of

44:35

being paid. The philosophy that the most successful tech startups in the past has been ease for the

44:42

end user. So why are they not instead investing in streamlining mobile money solutions which are already being

44:50

used widespread, don’t produce a Macbook Air worth of e-waste for every transaction,

44:56

will eliminate the need for a crypto exchange and will eliminate the need for a Nigerian

45:02

taxi driver to set up a Metamask wallet and get paid for a ride with an extremely volatile

45:08

digital token? Oh, is it perhaps because for Jack, number-go-up?

45:13

Jack Dorsey is now trying to become accepted in the Bitcoin community, whilst simultaneously

45:19

being the face of social media censorship, especially, censorship of their favourite

45:25

orange guy.

45:37

We’re working on that too. I get it. We’ll get to that.

45:43

Can you… can you please… He spends his days on twitter sharing anecdotal feel-good stories of people who have made

45:52

money with Bitcoin, and the rare cases in which it has supposedly helped people out of poverty.

45:57

He is also trying to squash all competition for Bitcoin in one fell swoop by labelling

46:02

them all as being owned by Silicon Valley VCs, which is not untrue, but it’s not untrue

46:09

of Bitcoin either. But trying to set yourself apart from other grifters is the first rule in the grifting

46:15

handbook. Sure, there are issues with access to physical banking services and documentation.

46:21

But the unbanked in 3rd world countries mostly are because they just don’t have a lot of money.

46:28

This leads to the sharing of resources, so only one person in the family needs an account.

46:34

The issue that needs addressing here is lack of income, not lack of a bank account.

46:40

But that’s not an issue that can be easily addressed with a flashy app without any vowels

46:45

in its name. Tunnel visioned tech CEOs and Silicon Valley VCs with ancap ideologies do not generally

46:52

consider local conditions when they preach about ‘banking the unbanked’, and these ideas have come and gone before.

46:59

There is no reason for an Ethiopian farmer to use cryptocurrency - unless they’re trying to

47:05

organise an international crime syndicate or avoid capital gains taxes, which… is

47:11

unlikely. In traditional banks you have to jump through multiple hoops to verify your ID and send

## Is it secure?

47:19

someone money. With blockchain tech, it’s a simple private key. This makes it vastly easier for someone to socially engineer someone’s pass phrase

47:28

and gain access to their wallet. No 2FA needed, no name of your first hamster.

47:33

And they have done it. Multiple times. And once it happens, it’s irreversible.

47:39

There’s no bank to call, or credit card company to ask for a chargeback. You only have to spend 5 minutes scrolling down the blog ‘web3isgoinggreat.com’ to

47:50

see that another high-level hacking, rug pull or NFT scam is committed pretty much every

47:56

day. You don’t even need to be a criminal mastermind. All you need is good programming knowledge, some social engineering skills and zero morals.

48:05

And to punctuate my point, the largest heist in American history was committed by 2…

48:11

fucking idiots. I’m a motherfucking bad bitch. Go on make me a sammich.

48:20

You annoying like vag itch. Heather R. Morgan and her husband, Ilya Litchenstein - who are suspected of laundering 4.5 billion dollars

48:30

worth of Bitcoin through various wallets and a dodgy marketplace, and transferred into

48:35

fiat currency via gift cards.

48:40

And what did they spend the money on? Journalist, a writer, a CEO, and a dirty, dirty, dirty dirty hoe.

48:48

To be clear, they’ve not been arrested on charges for the initial hack, but from what we know, it’s quite possible they carried out the attack themselves.

48:55

One lyric in particular in one of her masterpieces is ‘Spearfish your password/all your funds

49:01

transferred, flush you like a turd’. Spearphishing is like phishing (with a ph), except instead of sending out one email, or

49:10

‘net’, and waiting for your victims to come to you, you intentionally set your sights on one victim, and you might, say, send them a cold email, gain their trust and convince

49:20

them to send over their details over to you that way. This is how hacks usually happen.

49:26

It’s not someone in a hoodie and a V for Vendetta mask matrixing their way into the

49:32

mainframe of a bank, it’s very boring, polite emails - something Heather Morgan said she

49:39

was an expert at. Or, I’m sorry, a ‘hacker mindset’. The blockchain does not fix the inherent vulnerabilities of people when it comes to social engineering

49:50

\- and when you have a system that only requires a private key for access to funds, and a pseudonymous

49:55

system which already has tools built into it for laundering cash - then you’ve made

50:01

it even easier for a someone to steal $4.5 billion dollars from you and spend it on…

50:07

this. ‘Cause you suck like a vacuum cleaner’ Over the 6 years since the hack, either they’ve been pretty stupid the entire time, or they’ve

50:17

got sloppy with their laundering throughout the years. Who knows. But when authorities raided their apartment, among hoards of USB devices, cash and hollowed-out

50:26

books to hide it in, they found a burner phone in a clear plastic bag labelled “burner

50:32

phone” and a file on their computer named ‘passport ideas’ and a spreadsheet on

50:38

their cloud account which had addresses of all of their wallets and information about the

50:43

assets inside them. Some of them had filenames such as dirty\_wallet.dat.

50:50

Criminal masterminds. It’s not hard to see how, if you’re able to remain anonymous and you don’t have to

50:57

use a complex web of Walmart gift cards to transfer your stolen funds into usable currency,

51:03

crime on the blockchain is inherently incentivised. There is even more incentive for criminals to find bugs in the code, drain people’s wallets and freely spend the stolen crypto

51:15

in businesses around the world, or for bad actors to hide large scale ransomware in the

51:20

code for decentralised apps. It’s anonymous! Private! It’s not, it’s pseudonymous - meaning anyone who finds your wallet address can easily

51:30

see your entire transaction history. As soon as that wallet address is associated with your identity, that’s your transaction

51:39

history available on a public ledger for everyone to see. That’s not to mention that if, someday, miraculously, Ethereum’s smart contracts

51:48

actually have some sort of utility - all of your data will be on the blockchain in order for it to work.

51:54

Your mortgage. Your medical records. Everything you’ve ever posted on social media.

52:01

Perhaps someone doxxed your or posted revenge porn. It’s immutable.

52:07

On an append-only database. Unable to be deleted. Allows money to be sent around the world instantly!

## Sending money internationally?

52:12

Delays in international wire transfers are mostly down to checks for fraudulent activity.

52:18

The only reason you’d have any issue with this is if you were a criminal. Or Anna Delvey.

52:24

It is true that it could potentially be used for sending funds to protestors if the state’s banking system had cut them off, such as when this happened with the recent Canadian trucker

52:34

convoy, the coiner-bros of course went ‘Ah! We have the solution!’

52:43

\- only to find that they had to concoct a wild set of actions in order to change the computer money back into real money.

52:50

This somewhat hilariously involved the composition of a publicly available google doc in which

52:56

all the proposed actions could have been easily intercepted by the police. Just some of the materials needed included printers, paper, ink, large pliers, leather

53:07

gloves that cover wrists, screwdrivers, pens and paper, and 10 DVD disks.

53:13

The actions would culminate in the participants smashing the USB printer to pieces in a hotel

53:19

room that none of them are allowed to leave. Cash would have been easier.

53:24

A simple scroll down the Bitcoin hashtag on Twitter makes it extremely clear where these

53:30

people’s priorities lie, regardless of whichever supposed ‘war benefit’ they’re currently

53:35

peddling. It’s in their own pockets. You said bitcoin isn’t really doing anything right now, Bitcoin is actually saving people’s

53:43

lives. People are fleeing war torn Ukraine, they’re actually leaving to go to Poland, are they taking their gold bullion bars?

53:49

Absolutely not. And even if they did get er, get to the border, people are absolutely corrupt, if they get to the border, authorities can say ‘sorry can I have one of those gold bullion bars?’

53:57

and only let you in in that case. So you don’t really want to be snuggling up with your Bitcoin. Nobody wants to know that you own Bitcoin.

54:02

That’s the fundamental value. Let me make this clear. Russia is actually attempting to use crypto to undermine sanctions and the US dollar.

54:11

And he tricked Vitalik Buterin into helping him do this. In a world run by Bitcoin, or any crypto, wars will still be funded.

54:20

They seem to think that fiat funds wars and for some reason they think that crypto will

54:27

never be spent on wars. It makes no sense. Please put your Coinbase app away, and touch some fucking grass.

## bUt tHe FeD pRiNtS mOnEy

54:39

But you can’t print Bitcoin like the Fed prints money! We’re going to come back to the Federal Reserve and monetary policy - but I’m going

54:47

to point out here that Bitcoin’s 21 million cap is 5 lines of code which could be removed

54:53

at any time with a hard fork in the system. Just because no one wants the cap to be removed right now, doesn’t mean this will always

55:01

be the case. And with only 3 mining pools having to form a cartel to carry out a 51% attack, that’s not entirely impossible. And this seems like a good time to bring up Tether. Oh, fuck, Tether.

55:06

Ok. Sooo you have what’s called stablecoins which are already acting like a sort of central bank in the crypto space. Moving money in and out of the crypto ecosystem is hard, and you have to pay taxes on it,

55:14

so stablecoins have come about to allow people to hold their crypto in a token which is tied to the value of the US dollar.

55:22

Stablecoins like Tether and USDC are also supposed to be fully backed by real dollars - but guess what - they aren’t, and they lied about this for a long time.

55:32

This is another entire rabbit hole - but let’s just say they lied about their reserves by transferring funds into an account temporarily while a 3rd party auditor checked their reserves on

55:41

a specific date, then when the Paradise papers came out people found out that they were basically the same company as this huge exchange Bitfinex, you know, just one of the 99% of exchanges

55:48

that got hacked… and because they were lying about being fully backed by dollars, they could use Tether’s dollars to bail out Bitfinex when they lost $850 million dollars of their

55:54

customers’ cryptocurrency after a dodgy bank they were dealing with got shut down, and they lied about it, and the whole thing was started by a past ponzi schemer, someone

56:02

who got caught up in an online gambling scam and someone drowning in allegations of being a … “full libertarian” who wears rare pokemon cards in his hat.

56:08

GUYS, THIS VIDEO KILLED ME. So.

56:13

Stablecoins hold a hell of a lot of power over the supposedly decentralised crypto market

56:19

as a whole. Tether got hacked in 2017 and $30 million dollars was stolen,

56:25

and in response to this, they hard forked the Omni blockchain Tether resided on, because Tether decided that even though the blockchain was saying

56:34

the funds were in the hacker’s possession, they decided, well that’s not what the blockchain

56:39

should mean, because decentralisation means fuck all in this business and it a marketing

56:46

buzzword to get you to buy in to the system. Because Tether has got so much power, they could do this without the usual mining consensus

56:56

vote because all of the exchanges were in their pocket. Ya get me? A company that is powerful enough will fork the chain it sits on and this will always

57:07

be the case in the cryptospace. And then, it was found that Tether manipulated the price of Bitcoin in 2017 by buying large

57:17

amounts of it when it was declining with its own reserves! Cool!!!!!

57:23

So you’ve basically recreated an unreserved central bank in your own little magic computer world

57:29

That's completely manipulating the market But one that’s even worse than how bad you think the Federal Reserve is!

57:38

How people seem to still be using Tether when it literally has worked against all of the core tenets of the Bitcoin philosophy is beyond me, but again, it seems that as long as number-go-up,

57:50

no one cares. It’s decentralised, therefore trustless!

57:55

Systems tend to centralise as they scale, and blockchain is no exception. Bitcoin mining was mostly decentralised back in the naughties with the few early adopters

58:05

running single graphics cards in their homes - but it only took around 5 years for just 3 mining pools to have control over more than half of the network.

58:12

And the people using them now are suffering from all the negatives of the decentralised

58:19

aspects whilst using centralised apps built on the blockchain, so they’re actually not

58:25

benefitting from the decentralised aspects at all, they’re actually only benefitting from the centralised bits, ie using OpenSea, and exchanges to cash out into

58:36

usable money, all things overseen by the evil government, but the entire ecosystem is being

58:42

sold to them as decentralised. It’s not. At all.

58:48

The only supposedly decentralised aspects of the platforms they’re using are actually only hindering the users and the programmers.

58:57

Let’s harp back to the Bitcoin 0.1 release notes written by Satoshi Nakamoto in ‘09.

59:02

The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that’s required to make

59:08

it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies

59:14

is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend

59:21

it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve.

59:26

We have to trust them with our privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts.

59:31

So what have we ended up with? Everybody putting their trust in increasingly centralised mining pools, everyone putting

59:39

their trust in buggy code written by a human, everyone putting their trust in centralised APIs to connect apps to the blockchain, centralised jpg selling platforms, everyone putting their

59:46

trust in Bitcoin whales not to suddenly cash out leaving everyone with pennies, breaches of trust involving wash trading, painting the tape, selling securities fraudulently,

59:52

no privacy on a public ledger, a system rife with account hacks through stealing people’s identity, and all of it backed up by ‘stablecoins’ that not backed up by real dollars and manipulate

1:00:00

the market. In the case of Ethereum, the amount of ether that can be mined is not capped - but it is

1:00:07

entirely reliant on code written by this man. It is of course imperative that people have to ‘buy in’ to the change in code, but

1:00:14

as has been shown before, whichever chain Vitalik is behind, that’s the chain the

1:00:19

whales are going with, and that’s the chain the underlings will follow. No matter how much these people think this is a purely decentralised system, there is

1:00:29

an unusual personality cult surrounding Vitalik, and people respect him.

1:00:35

Yo difficulty ice age meltdown. Layer 1, Layer 3, 9, 27, 23, build your own hash function for maximum security.

1:00:49

In the same way, even though we don’t know who Satoshi Nakamoto is, they have been active

1:00:54

on the internet in the past, and nothing is stopping them from becoming active again and proposing a software fork.

1:01:01

And being the owner of an estimated $73 billion dollars worth of Bitcoin, or 5% of the total

1:01:08

supply, I wonder whether people would choose the fork that Lord Satoshi proposes, or the

1:01:14

one that tanks in value. Sounds super decentralised to me. In the case of blockchains planning on moving to a Proof of Stake system, the consensus

1:01:23

votes on a chain are given in proportion to the amount of money you have.

1:01:28

Meaning wealthy individuals and companies can effectively fork a chain to their preferred

1:01:33

code if they achieve more than 50% consensus votes. And with Bitcoin’s wealth distribution looking similar to that of North Korea’s, does this

1:01:43

sound entirely impossible to you? It’s incredibly difficult to get a coiner bro to engage with any of these arguments

1:01:51

however. I’ve seen enough MLM huns in my time become convinced that their shitty facecreams are

1:01:57

god’s jizz just because they think it’s their ticket out of being fucked in the ass by capitalism day in day out.

## The Superbowl Crypto ads & the "Early days" argument

1:02:06

The number one rebuttal to all this ‘FUD’ding always comes in the form of “oh, well it’s early days”.

1:02:11

This was relentlessly shoved in people’s faces during the Superbowl halftime show - in

1:02:16

which all ads were trying to spread FOMO, one of them by comparing the invention of

1:02:21

blockchain to the invention of the wheel, forks, toilets, the moon landing, lightbulbs,

1:02:29

the walkman, even democracy. Matt Damon basically calls you a pussboi for not investing in one of them,

1:02:35

History is filled with almosts. Within those who almost adventured…

1:02:40

equating the athlete scaling a rock face in freezing temperatures to you, sitting on your

1:02:46

arse and signing up to crypto.com to purchase a fucking jpg because Justin Beiber did.

1:02:51

I’m not sure I can think of one revolutionary invention in history which had to try so hard

1:02:58

to convince the entire populace to invest in it before it had even been proven useful

1:03:05

to society. But also, calling it ‘early days’ - we’re 13 years in.

1:03:11

In some aspects, I agree, but I at least think there should be at least some evidence of

1:03:16

a tangible use case by now that can’t be done on web2 protocols. HTML was invented in 1993, so in a way, it’s like it’s the 2006 of blockchain.

1:03:27

What were we doing on the internet in 2006? I had a Myspace profile, and Matt Damon wasn’t on TV telling me I’m a pussboi loser for

1:03:37

not using MSN messenger. I kinda wanted to do it anyway.

1:03:42

Moxie Marlinspike, in January this year, composed a blog in which he criticised the web3 protocol.

1:03:50

His main points were that no one would want to run their own server, and huge parts of it are still centralised such as the APIs used to connect Metamask wallets to the chain.

1:04:01

Vitalik responded with various assertions that ‘all of this was coming’. But here’s the fundamental problem with believing that web3 “utility” is ‘on

1:04:10

its way’. Because a blockchain needs to pay miners to mine to make it work, a blockchain needs a

1:04:17

native currency. So Vitalik comes along and makes Ethereum. Ethereum’s currency is called ether.

1:04:24

Before Ethereum is released to the public as this revolutionary blockchain tech, Vitalik and a load of his mates, including Peter Thiel, get given a load of the ether before it shoots

1:04:33

up in value. This is called a premine. It doesn’t matter whether ethereum is a good tech or not - because your ‘software

1:04:41

developers’ will come along anyway to make some cash. These ‘software developers’ will buy a load of ether, and then say ‘hey, we’ve

1:04:49

got a great idea for giving this blockchain some utility!’ and they market their proposed ‘utility’, they then promote an ICO to get people to

1:04:58

invest into this proposed ‘utility’ with the hope of making money. Among a lack of securities regulation, swathes of inexperienced retail investors pour their cash into a project they know nothing about.

1:05:13

There’s a name for bogus software promises already - it’s called vapourware - promises of a software that never materialises and only exists to prevent customers from switching

1:05:23

to a different solution. So the vapourware shillers make money from the ICO and the ether shooting up in price,

1:05:28

in turn Vitalik and his whale mates profit from the ether shooting up in price, and the software developers have no reason to make the software actually fulfil its goals at

1:05:38

all, because they’ve already made a fuck tonne of money. With the invested money, they’ve got two choices, they can either ride out the vapourware

1:05:46

promises for as long as possible waiting for the ether to go up even more based on the

1:05:51

bogus promises of other vapourwares, or they can rug, take the money and dip with no consequence.

1:05:59

Either way - Vitalik wins, ether whales win, the ‘software developers’ win, and nothing

1:06:06

of true utility gets built. In the real world, when a company goes public, if you don’t provide real value to the public,

1:06:15

you lose money. But why, oh, why would Matt Damon be calling us pussy boys if it can’t be used as intended?

1:06:23

Well, there’s a lot of billionaires and millionaires stuck in the system who want to pump the bag and cash out.

1:06:29

But there’s also a lot of people who legitimately want this technology to be revolutionary.

1:06:35

And we have to understand why. Writing this script caused me physical pain I’m serious this video broke my brain

## Bitcoin: The Gold Standard & Right-Wing Extremism

1:06:48

Now I leave posts on r/Bicoin like ‘I think the Federal Reserve actually introduced some

1:06:56

beneficial fiscal policies’ Just to feel something again The philosophy behind Bitcoin is all depriving the government of any power over monetary

1:07:06

policy. To explain the way Bitcoin is coded: the digital mining of bitcoin is supposed to reflect the

1:07:13

mining of gold. The increase in Bitcoin’s supply is supposed to happen at around the same rate gold was

1:07:20

mined. Back in 2010 you could mine a few blocks an hour on your pentium processor.

1:07:26

So as time went on, the mining of gold got increasingly difficult and slowed down, just

1:07:31

as mining bitcoin gets increasingly difficult as time goes on, and people have to buy more

1:07:36

mining nodes and burn down more forests etc to mine the same amount of coins. If you can prove you’ve done the work to the rest of the network of computers, you’re

1:07:45

allowed to enter the little bitcoin lottery which awards you with a bit of a bitcoin. This is what proof of work is, you’ve gotta prove you’ve done the work, you’ve gotta

1:07:54

prove you’ve burnt down a forest. So bitcoin is coded to reflect the gold standard.

1:08:01

The monetary system we had until the 1930s. And since many coiner-bros don't seem to be aware of what happened in History, let’s

1:08:10

explain this properly. In the roaring 20s, the post-war economy was booming.

1:08:16

And the rich were thinking - “Hey, you know what’s even cooler than money? More money.” So greedy people thought that buying stocks with money that they actually had wasn’t

1:08:24

enough, so they started buying more stocks with bank loans, and the greedy banks were like cool, more interest for me bro, I don’t foresee any closures happening here!

1:08:35

Foreshadowing is a narrative device. Companies were having more money chucked at them than a sexy stripper in a sleazy speakeasy.

1:08:43

They didn’t know what to spend it on anymore, and because people had already bought all the stuff they needed so they started to buy stocks instead, there was way too much money

1:08:51

sloshing around in the system without enough actual products being produced or bought by

1:08:58

customers. (Wait… does that kind of sound familiar…?) People started to notice the lack of any actual value leaving the system, panic began to spread,

1:09:08

and people ran to the banks to take their money out. Banks at the time were very small, and had to sell assets and take out loans to give

1:09:17

people their deposits back. This sucked all of the money out of the economy all at once, and a deflationary spiral happened.

1:09:26

Prices dropped. Businesses cut costs. People got fired. Nobody had money to spend on goods any more.

1:09:33

Inventory built up. Prices dropped even more. Ad infinitum. Then, during the 1930s, The Great Depression was swinging its dick hard in the faces of

1:09:44

the poor as unemployment soared, but the Fed Rez didn’t yet follow any sort of fiscal

1:09:49

policy for injecting money into the system. The US and European central banks still followed the gold standard, and were refusing to give

1:09:58

it up. But the UK was like the cool guy at the gold party, and when we left the gold party in

1:10:04

1931, gradually over the next 5 years, all the other counties were like, yeah this gold

1:10:10

party kinda sucks. And by 1936, all countries were out and were smoking some green at the way cooler, much

1:10:17

more laid back fiat afterparty. In that same year, John Maynard Keynes came through and dropped his smash hit The General

1:10:25

Theory of Employment, Interest and Money, and told the world’s governments that if

1:10:31

they bought 12 hardcopies each they’d all get a free KeynesFriend NFT and that’s why we all follow his teachings on fiscal policies to this day.

1:10:40

Actually, it might have been because it turned out they worked pretty well?

1:10:46

Because securities fraud was rife in the leadup to the stock market crash, (wait… does that kind of sound familiar…?) the SEC was created in 1933, along with the FDIC, which acts as

1:10:57

a sort of bank insurance policy that the banks pay a premium for, and this ensures that if

1:11:04

a bank ever fails ever again, everybody’s deposits would be protected, up to a certain

1:11:10

amount. Not everybody was happy with the retirement of the gold standard and the inception of

1:11:16

the Fed Rez however. Especially the rich. Wealthy businessmen plotted to overthrow President Roosevelt and replace him with a dictator.

1:11:26

Thankfully this never happened, but you could probably call what’s happening right now

1:11:32

Business Plot 2: Blockchain Boogaloo. Cut to German school children being read stories from a pamphlet called ‘The Protocols of

1:11:40

the Elders of Zion’. It is Nazi Germany, 1933, and Hitler is using the Great Depression to gain power.

1:11:47

The belief of a planned secret world domination spreads, along with the belief that Jewish

1:11:53

people are controlling the press and the central banks, and slowly devaluing your money through

1:11:59

inflation to keep it for themselves (wait… does that kind of sound familiar…?).

1:12:05

They recommend buying gold to protect yourself, one of the main assertions being that gold

1:12:10

\= money. (wait… does that kind of sound familiar…?) These ideologies became inextricably linked with the wealthy businessmen who still believed

1:12:21

in the gold standard. Eugenics and debunked ‘bell curve’ theories gained traction, a science funded by the wealthy

1:12:29

industrialist owners class. A cult was formed based on an obsession with the gold standard.

1:12:35

The same man who followed this cult went on to create the “Freedom School”, which

1:12:40

birthed the modern American libertarianism movement and Austrian economics.

1:12:49

Ooh, fun fact - Charles Koch was one of the students.

1:12:55

The ideologies of the ‘Freedom School’ have weaved their way through the last century, with reincarnations through various libertarian organisations and figures such as Ron Paul

1:13:07

and Murray Rothbard, who were also strong gold standard proponents.

1:13:12

In 1997, libertarians James Dale Davidson and William Rees-Mogg (Yes, that is his dad),

1:13:20

published The Sovereign Individual - expressing disdain for pesky taxes and pushing a future

1:13:26

of sound money via some sort of “digital cash”, and our mate Peter Thiel loved this

1:13:33

so much he wrote a foreword. We’ll come back to him. Ok. Since the 1930s, there have been 2 main economic schools of thought that fight over the cause

1:13:43

of the global financial crash. Keynesians mostly fought to remove the gold standard and introduce fiscal policy, and

1:13:51

Austrian School economists, or ‘Monetarists’, fought to keep it, blaming governments printing

1:13:58

money for all of our problems. Although various policies from both sides have been implemented over the years, the

1:14:04

argument to leave the gold standard behind has prevailed. It is widely considered among economists today that this is what helped lift the economy

1:14:14

out of depression. And look. I’m not a fucking economist, ok. I can only tell you objectively what’s happened in the past, and that there is 99% consensus

1:14:27

among all leading economists today that a return to the gold standard right now would

1:14:34

be a pretty fucking bad idea. On the contrary, have any conversation with a Bitcoin bro and you’ll soon find they

1:14:43

believe they’ve earned a master's-level economics degree awarded by the School of

1:14:49

Reddit, and they actually believe that a coded-in monetary policy devised by one person in 2008

1:14:57

is the answer to everyone’s fiscal woes. The number-go-up brainworms are real.

1:15:05

And if you’re an r/bitcoin bro currently writing me a lovely thesis in the comments

1:15:10

section about the fucking Cantillon effect I respectfully ask you to instead write your comment out in Notepad on a cheap laptop with Windows XP installed, burn the file to several

1:15:22

DVDs, post the DVDs to a neutral 3rd party, then ask them to Blackberry your comment to

1:15:28

a USB printer in a remote remote hotel room, go to the hotel room and don’t leave until

1:15:33

you’ve smashed it to pieces with a screwdriver. And selling a hedge against inflation to vulnerable people is not even a new scam.

1:15:41

Glenn Beck peddled a scheme in which people would be pressured to buy gold at an inflated price with the promise that it would increase in value over time, using hard salesmen and

1:15:51

pressure tactics to convince them that the dollar would be inflated to near zero.

1:15:56

The company was eventually forced to refund $4.5 million dollars to customers. The same thing is happening right now with bitcoin - except this time there will be no

1:16:06

one to sue, because the salesmen are hexagons on twitter. When I was researching this section of the video - all videos I would find on youtube

1:16:16

of people arguing that we were on the brink of another global financial crash because

1:16:22

of rising inflation rates were also shilling courses. And this is true of all the Bitcoin & crypto bros on twitter too - how can you trust anyone

1:16:33

to give advice on a stock they’re personally benefiting from? Yet no one in the community seems to give a single fuck, as long as number go up.

1:16:43

And the demonisation of inflation in the mainstream press, dubbed by Republicans as ‘Bidenomics’

1:16:51

merely to use as a weapon against him, is not helping. The use of the words “freedom” and “depriving ordinary people of value”, when translated,

1:17:02

simply means freedom for the rich, and not taking money away from the rich - it has meant

1:17:08

this since the inception of the conspiracy theories surrounding the federal reserve,

1:17:14

and it still means this in the bitcoin community now. For those in the back - you’re parroting the same talking points as Nazis.

1:17:23

Over the last 100 years, the Federal Reserve has created bubbles and burst them, enslaved

1:17:28

us with debt, and destroyed our purchasing power through inflation. Yes, it’s been a wonderful LIE!

1:17:34

For the bankers. There are striking parallels in Frank Capra’s It’s a Wonderful Life to the lies and tricks

1:17:41

that real bankers use to create the Federal Reserve. And then they were shocked when Jordan Peterson was announced as a speaker at a Bitcoin event.

1:17:49

Are we the baddies? 0.01% of people invested in bitcoin own 27% of bitcoin right now.

1:17:56

Who do you think is going to win here in the long run? How is that wealth all of a sudden going to be redistributed to the poor?

1:18:05

You aren't subverting the system, the system has already subverted you.

1:18:10

You aren’t getting rich, you’re buying the Winkelvoss twins another yacht. How about the people who are unable to buy in now, or benefit from generational bitcoin

1:18:21

wealth? The people who can’t afford to buy in now, who would like to have children in the future?

## Ethereum: Peter Thiel wants your data to build a Libertarian utopia

1:18:27

On to Ethereum. To understand Ethereum, I think it would be helpful to provide a quick background on Peter

1:18:33

Thiel. In the 80s, Peter was at Stanford University, serving as editor-in-chief of The Stanford

1:18:39

Review, a conservative libertarian newspaper. He then went on to co-found Paypal.

1:18:45

Theil wanted Paypal to be what people believe cryptocurrency provides today.

1:18:50

A hedge against inflation, except facilitated by giving customers easy access to foreign

1:18:56

currencies. He now regards the company as it is today as a ‘failure’ of Paypal’s original

1:19:02

goal, and in 2015 on a Reddit AMA he mentioned his interest in Bitcoin fulfilling this vision.

1:19:10

After selling paypal, in 2004 he went on to co-found Palantir, a data analysis firm.

1:19:17

They stated they could use their knowledge of fraud detection software in the fintech industry and apply this to a wider spectrum of datasets to detect terrorist activity on

1:19:27

the internet. Their first backer was the CIA. Clearly building up an increasing interest in the harvesting of data, it’s not surprising

1:19:37

why, in 2004, Peter dropped half a million dollars into Facebook, becoming the first

1:19:43

outside investor. He acquired 10% of the company and a position on the board.

1:19:49

In 2013, Palantir controversially became involved in the Cambridge Analytica scandal.

1:19:56

Cambridge Analytica had gained access to over 87 million Facebook profiles without their

1:20:02

permission and used the data to target political ads, and it was this that experts believe

1:20:08

may have swung the Brexit vote in Leave’s favour. It was alleged by a whistleblower that multiple Palantir employees, sort of, ‘helped’

1:20:18

them with this. Interestingly, Cambridge Analytica attempted to start its own cryptocurrency, Dragon Coin,

1:20:25

for the specific purpose of harvesting people’s data. It was marketed to the Chinese public as a way to gamble in casinos on the island of

1:20:37

Macau because gambling regulations are rather restrictive. But the project was abandoned once the scandal came to light in 2018 and the company shut

1:20:44

down. “The way that Cambridge Analytica was talking about it, they were viewing it as a means

1:20:50

of being able to basically inflict government control and private corporate control over

1:20:56

individuals, which just takes the whole initial premise of this technology and turns it on

1:21:03

its head in this very dystopian way,” she said. The year after Cambridge Analytica collapsed among a sea of controversy, in 2013, a young

1:21:13

Russian man called Vitalik Buterin wrote the whitepaper for Ethereum. In 2014, The Thiel Fellowship funded Vitalik Buterin with $100,000 to drop out of that

1:21:25

stupid woke college that was no doubt poisoning his brain with evil multiculturalism and holding

1:21:32

him back, and got him to pursue Ethereum full time. In 2020, the NHS asked Palantir for help in battling the spread of the pandemic.

1:21:43

Palantir charged the NHS £1 for their services. They didn’t care about the money.

1:21:49

They just wanted the data. The NHS gave Palantir access to millions of British citizens’ medical records with which

1:21:55

they could train their data analysis models. In 2017, Bitcoin shot up in price when his VC, The Founders Fund, bought 15 to 20 million

1:22:05

dollars worth. I don’t think it’s a coincidence that the same people who are funding CIA-backed

1:22:13

data analysis firms and have direct ties to the Cambridge Analytica scandal and are scraping

1:22:18

NHS data are also funding blockchain technology. Do you really think web3 is going to be about ‘privacy’, or you being ‘in charge of

1:22:28

your own data’? In 2017, the Thiel Network came together in the UK.

1:22:34

This is a network of Conservative academics, including Jordan Peterson, who are attempting

1:22:41

to influence government policy on ‘free speech’ - ‘free speech’ being code for

1:22:47

‘normalising white nationalism’. Palantir’s chief of staff has attended meetings with Christian theologians at Cambridge University’s

1:22:56

Faculty of Divinity, with Jordan Peterson in attendance. Their common concern was the increasing threat from the advancement of a ‘liberal’ agenda

1:23:08

to traditional Christian religious and theological beliefs – including an unnerving fascination

1:23:15

with race science…Unknown to most, Peterson appears to be sympathetic to scientific racism

1:23:21

despite disavowing far-right views – but tends to only admit this, and in carefully

1:23:27

guarded terms, in specific discussions. There are profound and virtually irremediable differences in people's cognitive performance

1:23:35

and those differences have a very, er, a very solid biological and heritable basis.

1:23:42

There are Ashkenazi Jews, that have on average a fifteen point advantage over the rest of the caucasian population which is sufficient to account for their radical overrepresentation

1:23:52

in positions of authority and influence, and productivity. Of course that was laid out to some degree in ‘The Bell Curve’, back in the 1990s.

1:24:00

Peter has now left his position on the board of Facebook so he can spend more time supporting the campaign for Donald Trump’s reelection, being Silicon Valley’s most outspoken supporter

1:24:12

of him. Now we’re told that the great debate is about who gets to use which bathroom.

1:24:18

This is a distraction from our real problems.

1:24:24

Who cares? He’s now heavily invested in Ethereum, Bitcoin and EOS blockchain technology, and in addition,

1:24:34

has direct control of the most advanced data algorithms in the world.

1:24:40

In 2011, Peter’s plans of developing a private island free of all government regulation was

1:24:46

scuppered when he came to realise that it was ‘not quite feasible’. The residents of the nearby French Polynesian islands had argued they didn’t get much

1:24:54

say in the proposed plans to build the supposedly self-sustaining islands just off their shore,

1:25:00

and only benefited the rich residents wanting to avoid tax. Funny that.

1:25:06

This is a phenomenon libertarians have always dreamed of, and it’s called SeaSteading.

1:25:12

Innovative political systems could serve humanity better than governments do today. That’s why we work to enable seasteads.

1:25:18

Floating cities which give people opportunities to peacefully test new ideas about living together.

1:25:24

The most successful become thriving new societies inspiring change around the world. We’re creating this future because governments profoundly affect our lives, and improving

1:25:32

them would unlock enormous human potential. The aim of Ethereum, it seems to me, is Thiel’s second chance at seasteading.

1:25:42

He wants to cyberseastead on a cloud economy, beholden to no government regulations and

1:25:50

no tax. But he needs people to jump onto his seastead.

1:25:57

And what better way to get people to jump other than to tell people there’s treasure on the island?

1:26:03

Crypto is worthless as a currency, but it’s the perfect marketing strategy.

1:26:10

It means Google and Facebook will no longer have all of Silicon Valley’s precious data,

1:26:15

but the first companies to build on the blockchain will instead, and they won’t be held back

1:26:22

by silly regulations like GDPR. And remember - a blockchain is immutable.

1:26:30

They’ll potentially have access to a much larger pool of data than Google and Facebook

1:26:37

have now. This isn’t the masses fighting against the 1%, it’s the 5% fighting the 1%.

1:26:46

For data. Sure, you can ‘choose’ to have an NFT of your medical records on the chain, but

1:26:52

we will eventually get to the point where it’s made so ‘easy’ and ‘convenient’ for you to have, say, your medical records, or your mortgage details on the chain, that

1:27:01

it would be almost stupid not to. We’re already on the trajectory towards completely transparent data profiles right

1:27:10

now - we purchase more and more devices and download more and more apps everyday for the

1:27:16

purposes of ‘convenience’ - and we’re beginning to accept that this just means your data will belong to that company.

1:27:23

But in the future - it will belong to all companies that build on the blockchain.

1:27:29

It would be stupid to not build your app on the blockchain. There would be no hope of your tech startup being competitive if you didn’t.

1:27:37

As Satoshi Nakamoto said themself - “It takes advantage of the nature of information

1:27:42

being easy to spread but hard to stifle.” They would like a society governed by code written by them, without having to deal with

1:27:51

the inconvenient nuances of a progressing society involving racial tensions or the experiences

1:27:58

of trans people, or congress holding them back with rules and regulations.

1:28:03

But the world isn’t a logic puzzle that a Russian computer programmer can code us

1:28:09

out of. the human experience will never escape feelings and needs that go beyond rigid code.

1:28:16

This is a utopian vision based on an engineer’s entirely systemic analysis of how a society

1:28:24

should be governed. Cultural and political context eradicated. This entire system is hard-coded to realise the whims of the richest in society.

1:28:37

A free market is a type of democracy, but one where the poor get the fewest votes.

1:28:44

This is exactly how a DAO works, and this is exactly how the Proof-of-Stake system works.

1:28:50

Consensus power over the whole chain - for the rich. Crumbs for the poor.

1:28:56

And you’ll be so poor, you’ll be compelled to sell more of your data to the rich.

1:29:03

This was already proven with the catastrophic failure of Ethereum’s first ever DAO, “The

1:29:09

DAO”, when the blockchain was hard-forked to reverse a hack, draining their DAO of 50

1:29:15

million dollars. Their super wealthy VC investors didn’t want to lose their money, so they changed the rules.

1:29:20

The unforked chain, Ethereum Classic still exists, and its crypto is worth $25.

1:29:27

I wonder why most people chose the chain the rich people chose? And if you really want a sinking realisation of how bad this could get if it were devoid

1:29:36

of any regulation, Google Assassination Politics. Back to present day - and blockchain technology advocates are pushing the idea of social media

1:29:46

on the blockchain. On a protocol which records the history of everything you’ve ever done online, the

1:29:52

incentive to remain completely anonymous is paramount.

1:29:57

This could give rise to an increase in far-right ideologies peddled online, culminating in

1:30:03

terrible situations - if left to develop unregulated, as the movement wishes. It’s quite hard to conceptualise what the future they’re envisioning would look like

1:30:13

right now - in much the same way that someone in the 80s couldn’t envision what the iPhone

1:30:19

can do now. So try to think of it like this: Bitcoin wants to be a simple peer-to-peer payment app on

1:30:26

your iPhone. Ethereum wants to be the iPhone. All of the data on the blockchain is the motherboard, the large chip in your iphone - and it’s

1:30:37

a ginormous database of everybody’s medical records, social media presence, past & present,

1:30:44

financial history, your life story, your loves, your hates, everything.

1:30:50

Based on this ginormous database, using patterns the AI has found, it can accurately predict

1:30:56

the actions of any human being on earth, even if you go fully off-grid and none of your personal data has been contributed.

1:31:04

Now imagine that the DAOs, the large companies that build on the blockchain that will inevitably

1:31:09

become very powerful, are the main apps on your homescreen. One of them could be a marketing company DAO.

1:31:17

A company could come along to them, perhaps a pharmaceutical company selling drugs, and

1:31:23

they could say to the marketing DAO, I want you to use all the data you have to start

1:31:29

advertising my drugs to not just everybody who might need them now, but everybody who

1:31:34

is likely to need them in the future - I would like to plant our brand into their brain 5,

1:31:40

10 years in advance. And then say you might have another app on this Ethereum iPhone called the Military Industrial

1:31:55

Complex. Fuck knows who will have access to those powers at that point, but the Military Industrial

1:32:02

Complex could be one huge DAO. Based on the data, it could draw out an entire roadmap for invading a country based on its

1:32:11

weakest entry points and weakest individuals. It could disseminate extremely intelligent, veiled propaganda to the citizens.

1:32:20

The ‘war’ could be over in minutes. The algorithm would decide who lives and who dies, only responding to votes cast by anonymous

1:32:32

wealthy token holders. And just in case you were thinking this sounds far-fetched - Peter Thiel’s company Palantir

1:32:40

have already had their algorithms used to decide which ICE detainees to arrest.

1:32:46

It has been used to fuel the biggest deportation raid in US history, the infamous Bronx 120

1:32:54

raid, and 100 7-eleven raids. He already oversees the algorithms that decide the fates of immigrant families’ lives.

1:33:06

443 people were arrested, and almost none of them could be prosecuted - yet there was

1:33:13

no one, no human to blame for the poor profiling. Where code is king, you can only blame the algorithm.

1:33:21

Oh, and he plans to live until he’s 120 years old by taking HGH and blood transfusions

1:33:27

from the young. Trillion dollars. And now the mark- Oh!

## Is this a bubble?

1:33:33

Ohhhhh it went to zero! Yooooooooo! Hodl til it hits the floor Hodl til it hits the floor

1:33:43

Hodl til it hits the floooooooooor But will the data revolution happen? That’s a tough one.

1:33:50

I do believe this is a bubble, all of the tech is clearly overvalued for reasons I’ve

1:33:56

spelled out, but - it doesn’t mean it will pop in spectacular fashion - depending on

1:34:02

how long the VCs and vapourware developers can drag it out. It could slowly deflate. If it does deflate or pop, however, the VC investors will not allow it to leave their

1:34:12

billionaire clients in the red. Without access to sophisticated algorithms, retail investors will be left in the dirt.

1:34:20

That’s just an inevitability. And the worrying concentration of those with far-right, conspiratorial tendencies who have

1:34:27

bought into these schemes may have the rug spectacularly pulled out from under them - and

1:34:34

they are going to get angry. And will they turn to socialism to try and fix these problems?

1:34:39

I don’t think so. The crypto-evangelist population skews heavily towards a sort of New Age libertarian, anti-government

1:34:48

right wing-ism, and when they see their financial dreams evaporate, they will likely set their

1:34:54

sights for revenge on the things they already despise. The broad effect will lead to a large number of newly angry, bitter, disillusioned, hopeless

1:35:03

people who are too steeped in the culture wars to turn towards working class solidarity,

1:35:09

and instead turn towards hate… The delusion that salvation from capitalism can be found in new, more clever capitalism

1:35:17

is incredibly seductive, and always wrong. We may be forced to integrate this technology into society in the long run.

1:35:26

People like Andrew Yang even believe that it could be a force for good - eradicating poverty. I have no idea how - and he doesn’t give us any kind of road map which supposedly gets

1:35:36

us there.

1:35:41

But VCs have been wrong in the past. They said we’d have air taxis by now to take us to the airport.

1:35:48

What we actually got was more traffic, but in a tunnel underground. Oh my, there’s a traffic jam.

1:35:55

Here’s an idea, how about trains? AI, gene editing, robotics and 3D printing are all predicted as being the future, and

1:36:05

they could be right, or they could be very wrong. But if they’re right - it needs to be carefully regulated, and seen over by the correct people,

1:36:13

otherwise we will suffer from unfettered capitalism and rampant inequality in ways we’ve never

1:36:20

seen before. I have nothing against an automated revolution, because this could lead to humans having to

1:36:26

work less. This would mean more time for art - and none of it will be of fucking apes.

1:36:33

But in the wrong hands, it could lead to an elitist owner class and jobless masses.

1:36:42

Currently 47% of US jobs are threatened by automation, and this could go up to 80%.

1:36:49

And with an economy based on digital ownership and smart contracts, the elite could collect royalties on every transaction.

1:36:57

The idea of renting digital assets from an owner class is already being thrown around

1:37:02

\- if left to its own devices, I think this could lead to a sort of tech neo-feudalism.

1:37:09

Or… you know… it’s probably nothing. Web3 wants to take politics as we know out of many things but not to be “neutral”

1:37:17

but to take democratic rights and rules for participation away. When only the code decides and there is no place for debate and political struggle, how

1:37:28

do the disenfranchised get heard? How do the powerless organize and revolt?

1:37:34

Politics is about struggles. About people having different interests and fighting for them and often against their political opponents.

1:37:42

Web3 doesn’t want to “stay out of it”, it wants it to stop. Whether it happens or not, the conclusion I’ve come to is this - Satoshi Nakamoto

1:37:53

created blockchain technology after the financial crash in 2008 and successfully marketed it

1:37:59

as ‘giving power back to the people’ - and people still believe that to this day.

1:38:05

But the people behind blockchain technology didn’t want to help the protesters of Occupy

1:38:11

Wall Street - they wanted to be the people on the balcony, with the champagne.

1:38:17

But if the bubble pops, OpenSea will be pretty much worthless - so I might buy it and change

1:38:23

the code to redirect everyone’s NFT jpg links to Goatse. Full circle, baby.
