# The Cult of Done How to Finish the Thing

![The Cult of Done: How to Finish the Thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJQj1uKtnus?list=WL)

## Description

The Cult of Done manifesto was written in 2009. I read it that same year, as the ideas swept through the maker community.
  https: //medium.com/@bre/the-cult-of-done-manifesto-724ca1c2ff13

I think of many of the 13 principles every single day, as I write these videos, produce my audio fiction podcasts, and write music or code for any of my projects.

This framework has changed my life for the better, and now I'd like to share it with you.

## Introduction

  0: 00

hi friends my name is Tris and this is

  0: 01

no boiler plate focusing on Fast

  0: 03

technical videos The Cult ofd Manifesto

  0: 06

was written by maker Bri ptis and writer

  0: 08

Kio Stark in 2009 and they released it

  0: 11

under Creative Commons license I read it

  0: 13

that same year as the ideas swept

  0: 16

through the maker Community I think of

  0: 18

many of the 13 principles every single

  0: 19

day as I write these videos produce my

  0: 21

audio fiction podcasts and write music

  0: 23

or code for any of my projects this

  0: 25

framework has changed my life for the

  0: 27

better and now I'd like to share it with

  0: 30

you everything you see in this video

  0: 31

script references and images are part of

  0: 33

a markdown document available freely on

  0: 35

GitHub under a public domain license the

  0: 37

illustrations in this video have been

  0: 39

kindly provided by James provau who made

  0: 41

this fantastic Cult of dawn poster that

  0: 42

hung in my room for many years inspiring

  0: 44

me as I was getting started as an

  0: 45

engineer in London James told me that

  0: 48

for what was just an afternoon doodle a

  0: 50

lot actually came out of this poster for

  0: 52

him Bri and James connected and worked

  0: 54

together very early on at makot and BR

  0: 56

also introduced him to the make folks

  0: 58

which led to some work for their

  0: 59

magazine SC to check out James's work at

  1: 01

james.com let's have a closer look at

  1: 04

his wonderful illustrations the first

## Not Knowing Action Completion

  1: 06

principle is that there are three states

  1: 08

of being not knowing action and

  1: 11

completion not knowing is the initial

  1: 13

stage where you are unaware or lack

  1: 15

knowledge about something it could be a

  1: 17

problem a task a skill or any situation

  1: 20

this stage is categorized by ignorance

  1: 22

uncertainty and curiosity the next phase

  1: 25

is action this is where you learn

  1: 27

explore work or take steps to change

  1: 29

your state of not knowing it involves

  1: 31

effort struggle practice and nearly

  1: 33

always mistakes completion is the final

  1: 36

stage where a task or process is

  1: 38

finished or the problem is solved the

  1: 40

state of not knowing has been

  1: 41

transformed into knowledge or skill

  1: 43

through your action these three states

  1: 45

are cyclical and continuous after

  1: 47

completion you have a better

  1: 49

understanding of the problem and you

  1: 50

very likely have ideas about how to do

  1: 52

it again better next time principle two

  1: 55

is accept everything as draft it helps

  1: 57

to get it done prototypes make it to

  1: 59

production quick sketches become

  2: 00

long-term plans and things you write

  2: 02

down to get them out of your head end up

  2: 03

in the final published book this is as

  2: 05

true for a painting as it is for a

  2: 07

YouTube channel what you're doing is

  2: 09

just a draft it doesn't have to be

  2: 10

perfect it never will be even after it's

  2: 13

done some of the biggest Community

  2: 15

projects in the world started off with

  2: 16

just an idea and a draft three there is

## No Editing

  2: 20

no editing stage painting has no editing

  2: 23

if you make a mistake you start again

  2: 25

performing music has no editing if you

  2: 27

make a mistake you keep going and hope

  2: 28

the audience didn't notice and pottery

  2: 31

has no editing if it comes out of a Kil

  2: 32

and you don't like it smash it to pieces

  2: 34

and start again this principle models

  2: 37

the way the world actually works when

  2: 39

you release something into the world be

  2: 41

it a book or a programming language

  2: 42

you've lost control of it in a very big

  2: 45

way learn to accept this don't tweak

  2: 47

what you've got make another one four

## Pretending

  2: 51

pretending you know what you're doing is

  2: 52

almost the same as knowing what you are

  2: 54

doing so just accept that you know what

  2: 56

you're doing even if you don't and do it

  2: 58

this is the ageold advice to fake it

  3: 00

till you make it I completely agree this

  3: 02

is how I do all my projects and you

  3: 04

should too you're watching me learn how

  3: 06

to be a YouTuber in real time you're

  3: 09

watching me learn rust in real time

  3: 10

learn how to write stories for my audio

  3: 12

  3: 14

learn how to edit and write music for

  3: 16

them all in real time I'm learning that

  3: 18

maybe sponsors don't really work for me

do sign up and let's chat thanks to

  3: 42

everyone for supporting me on this wild

  3: 43

adventure back to the cult of done five

## Banish procrastination

  3: 47

banish procrastination if you wait more

  3: 49

than a week to get an idea done abandon

  3: 51

it you don't necessarily have to throw

  3: 53

it away but you do have to try something

  3: 55

else when creativity strikes it flows

  3: 58

out of your fingers into your keys or

  3: 59

your paintbrush or your guitar but

  4: 02

sometimes the muses don't sing if you

  4: 04

write a song a week for a whole year

  4: 06

like my hero Jonathan Colton here did in

  4: 08

2005 you can't procrastinate if the end

  4: 11

of the week comes without a good

  4: 12

finished song you have to abandon the

  4: 14

idea that didn't work and try the next

  4: 16

one ideas in your brain are like a pipe

  4: 19

full of random stuff some of it will be

  4: 21

good some not so good if you're not

  4: 23

feeling it don't try to make a bad idea

  4: 26

better try the next idea this is the

  4: 29

principle that nanoro encourages its

  4: 31

writers with write 1600 words every

  4: 33

single day in November and by December

  4: 35

you will have a novel's worth of raw

  4: 37

material it might be good or it might be

  4: 39

bad but you will have brought out your

  4: 41

creativity into the world and can start

  4: 43

editing or start the next thing because

## Laugh at perfection

  4: 46

the point is not to finish but to move

  4: 48

on to the next one you'll be one project

  4: 50

better one project wiser one project

  4: 52

closer to your breakout hit or viral

  4: 54

video or beautiful rug that will finally

  4: 56

tie the room together once you're done

  4: 58

you can throw it away you don't have to

  5: 00

keep working on it you're done smash the

  5: 02

pots burn the paintings the art isn't

  5: 04

the art the art is never the art the art

  5: 07

is the thing that happens inside you

  5: 08

when you make it and the feeling in the

  5: 10

heart of the beholder number eight laugh

  5: 13

at Perfection it's boring and keeps you

  5: 15

from being done I'm not saying have low

  5: 16

standards I'm saying you're done let it

  5: 20

go your final goal your end of the

  5: 22

project your deliverable the thing that

  5: 24

you're going to get paid to do comes

  5: 26

after you're finished the 8020 rule

  5: 28

comes into play here too don't obsess

  5: 31

over the final details make for more

## Stay in your lane

  5: 34

nine people without dirty hands are

  5: 36

wrong doing something makes you right

  5: 39

life is full of small-minded people with

  5: 41

narrow Horizons and they're all trying

  5: 43

to kill you they'll kill you with words

  5: 46

like be reasonable play it safe and the

  5: 49

worst stay in your lane you don't have

  5: 52

to listen to these people you don't have

  5: 53

to listen to anyone I recommend

  5: 55

listening to the people who are building

  5: 57

the things you love painting the

  5: 58

paintings you love and writing the music

  6: 00

or stories you love a small detour if

  6: 02

you will permit me Martha Graham was an

  6: 04

American modern dancer and choreographer

  6: 06

her style reshaped American dance and is

  6: 09

still taught worldwide and she has

  6: 10

advice for us that I will read verbatim

  6: 14

there is a Vitality Martha says a life

  6: 16

force a quickening that is translated

  6: 18

through you into action and there is

  6: 20

only one of you in all time this

  6: 22

expression is unique and if you block it

  6: 24

it will never exist through any other

  6: 26

medium and be lost the world will not

  6: 29

not have it it is not your business to

  6: 31

determine how good it is nor how it

  6: 33

Compares with other expression it is

  6: 35

your business to keep it yours clearly

  6: 37

and directly to keep the channel open

  6: 40

you do not even have to believe in

  6: 42

yourself or your work you have to keep

  6: 44

open and aware directly to the urges

  6: 46

that motivate you keep the channel open

  6: 49

no artist is pleased there is no

  6: 51

satisfaction whatever at any time there

  6: 53

is only a queer Divine dissatisfaction a

  6: 56

blessed unrest that keeps us marching

  6: 58

and makes us More Alive than the others

  7: 01

I think Martha would have approved of

  7: 03

the cult of done don't you 10 failure

## Failure counts as done

  7: 06

counts as done so the mistakes failure

  7: 09

is good if you don't try you can't fail

  7: 11

it took me a long time to realize this

  7: 12

but failure shows you tried and you know

  7: 15

what not to do next time an entrepreneur

  7: 18

who succeeds with their first company

  7: 20

has learned nothing someone who fails a

  7: 22

few times has had much better lessons

  7: 26

and no one knows what they're doing

  7: 27

especially those who haven't failed Bo

  7: 29

Burnham here understands this success

  7: 31

teaches us nothing 11 destruction is a

## Destruction is done

  7: 35

variant of done when you're done you can

  7: 36

move on to other things if you destroy

  7: 39

the thing either intentionally or

  7: 40

unintentionally you're still done some

  7: 42

experimentation requires destruction

  7: 45

you've not failed says Thomas Edison

  7: 47

famously you found 10,000 ways in which

  7: 50

it doesn't work 12 if you have an idea

  7: 52

and publish it on the internet that

  7: 54

counts as a ghost of Dum the muses send

  7: 57

some ideas to the wrong mind I think or

  8: 00

the right mind but with the wrong

  8: 01

experience or skills or tools that idea

  8: 03

isn't yours to hide if you can't build

  8: 05

it send it out into the world in a post

  8: 07

or a video and you're done you've done

  8: 09

your part this time round don't hold on

  8: 11

to it imagining you'll do it be honest

  8: 13

with yourself and let others build it

  8: 15

for you ideas are worthless give them

  8: 17

away 13 done is the engine of more being

## Conclusion

  8: 21

done is wonderful being done is

  8: 23

addictive being done is the only way to

  8: 25

find out what's next these principles

  8: 28

these guidelines

  8: 30

have helped me finish projects over the

  8: 31

years especially number eight Perfection

  8: 33

is boring I'm sure I'm wrong somewhere

  8: 34

  8: 35
