## Intro

  0: 00

here's a little experiment does the hexagon in the Middle look concave and indented or is it convex and bumping out

  0: 07

if you think it's indented or concave odds are you're from a western culture or some other culture that reads from

  0: 13

left to right if you think it's bumping out or convex you're more likely to be from a culture that reads from right to

  0: 19

left like Arabic this is just one example of how culture can shape the way you see the world but it goes Way Beyond

  0: 26

just some quirky little optical illusions culture completely changes the way our brains process information and

  0: 33

because of that various cultures design things very differently it's why this Japanese rice cooker looks totally

  0: 38

different from this American design same thing with traditional Japanese versus European joinery or these movie posters

  0: 44

the list goes on answer in progress and Cynthia Zhu made videos explaining why Western and Eastern cultures designed

  0: 50

websites so differently and I found these videos really inspiring and I wanted to dig even deeper into the topic

  0: 56

of how culture affects not just website design but all does I learned that religious philosophy local language

  1: 03

geographical quirks and even local laws can dictate the trajectory of culture

  1: 09

and design Evolution there's even one Harvard Professor who wrote a 500 page book arguing that Western culture went

  1: 15

in a completely different direction because the church made it illegal to marry your cousins about 1500 years ago

  1: 22

more on that later throughout this video you'll gain a deep understanding of how culture informs design decisions the

  1: 28

designed objects that surround you tell a story about culture just look at this Japanese joinery notice the intricacy

## Japanese Joinery

  1: 35

and complexity of this joint why not just nail two pieces of wood together it would be a lot simpler that way right

  1: 40

but if we think about the cultural backdrop these Advanced joinery Techniques actually make a lot of sense

  1: 46

in traditional Japan all craftsmanship and especially woodworking was almost

  1: 51

like a form of spiritual practice the Japanese Shinto belief system places spiritual emphasis on nature especially

  1: 59

trees the use of natural wood to wood joints is an extension of this philosophy where the wood itself and its

  2: 05

natural qualities are respected that's why traditional Japanese Woodworkers didn't just simply nail two pieces of

  2: 11

wood together another common theme in Japanese Shintoism and Buddhism is the acceptance that nothing is permanent

  2: 16

eventually these wooden joints will rot away and need to be replaced or repaired that's why the traditional joins are

  2: 22

often designed to be taken apart and reassembled this relates to the Japanese aesthetic of wabi-sabi which appreciates

  2: 29

the beauty in imperfection and aging well-designed wooden joins age more gracefully and they're easier to replace

  2: 35

but design and culture is also heavily driven by geography and climate Japan is

  2: 42

prone to earthquakes and wooden buildings with this kind of joinery can flex and bend a bit better than two

  2: 48

pieces of wood simply nail together plus Japan has a humid climate and wood tends to expand and contract with changes in

  2: 55

humidity moisture can actually seep in through the hole that the nail creates and deeper in into the wood causing it

  3: 01

to rot sooner being an isolated island nation Japanese Woodworkers also didn't always have access to metal and when

  3: 08

they did the metal usually had impurities and was low quality geography climate and resource availability all

  3: 15

played a major role in how this joinery was designed but it gets even crazier

## Culture Changes The Way Your Brain Processes Information

  3: 20

when you realize that your culture can often dictate the way your brain processes information even the language

  3: 26

you speak can literally change how you see the world isn't that crazy anyway

  3: 31

eastern and western people see the world in a totally different way by the way when I say Western cultures I'm talking

  3: 37

about Northwestern Europe and the countries that branched out from them when I say Eastern cultures I'm talking

  3: 42

mostly about East Asia in one study psychologists asked Japanese and American subjects to analyze an

  3: 48

underwater scene like this and describe what they see the American test subjects would say something like I saw three big

  3: 55

fish to the right they were white and green with pink fins the Japanese participants would start with context

  4: 01

they'd say that it looks like a pond there were rocks and shells and plants on the bottom and then there were three

  4: 06

big fish to the right eye tracking technology revealed that the Americans were searching for the main object or

  4: 12

focal point and Eastern cultures were taking in the overall Vibe they look at the context first and then look at the

  4: 19

focal points what you're seeing here is actually even more information dense than it looks that's because many East

  4: 25

Asian languages use compact characters that allow for more information to fit

  4: 30

in less space when compared with Western languages as we delve deeper into the intricacies of eastern and western

## Ground News

  4: 36

cultures in design it's crucial to remember that the lens through which we view the world can significantly shape

  4: 43

our understanding and perceptions this brings me to the role of the media and how in a world teeming with

  4: 49

sensationalism it's becoming challenging to discern the full unbiased picture it's akin to observing a complex design

  4: 55

but only acknowledging one element of it that's where ground news comes in this

  5: 00

app and website consolidates media from across the globe allowing readers to compare coverage and gain a

  5: 06

comprehensive perspective on what's being reported it's an invaluable tool for seeing how different cultures and

  5: 11

political leanings interpret events right down to the language used in headlines which can often frame our

  5: 17

interpretation of issues for every story ground news offers a visual breakdown of the reporting Outlets revealing their

  5: 24

political biases factual reliability ownership and the countries covering the

  5: 29

story it's a tool that empowers you to stay informed on breaking news design Trends and cultural shifts without

  5: 35

falling parade and media bias Embrace a broader perspective and enrich your understanding by visiting round.news

  5: 42

design Theory the link is in the description below but let's continue our exploration into cultural design

  5: 48

elements the differences in visual processing between East and West happens at a very young age just look at this

## Differences In Visual Processing Between East & West

  5: 55

study comparing drawings and collages done by Japanese children and Canadian children the Japanese Children Place far

  6: 02

more detail throughout the frame but the compositions by the Canadian children have more of a central Focus you see

  6: 07

this contrast in traditional East Asian art that has less of a focus and creates more of an overall Vibe whereas Western

  6: 14

Art tends to have more of a focal point in another experiment Asians and Western children were shown three things a

  6: 20

rabbit a cat a cat and a carrot when asked to group them American Kids paired the rabbit and the cat Together Asian

  6: 27

children however grouped the rabbit and the carrot together because rabbits eat carrots so what's the deal if

  6: 33

participants match the rabbit with the cat they're likely using wool-based analytic reasoning placing the rabbit

  6: 40

and the cat both in the animal category but if they match the rabbit with a carrot it reveals a more holistic way of

  6: 46

thinking emphasizing the functional relationship between rabbits and carrots once again rabbits eat carrots with over

  6: 53

3 000 participants from 30 countries the results clearly indicated that Western populations leaned more towards analytic

  7: 00

thinking while the rest of the world especially East Asia showcased more holistic reasoning people raised in

  7: 06

societies with intense relationship connections are predisposed to think in holistic terms prioritizing

  7: 12

relationships and broader contexts and this manifests itself in design in some

  7: 17

very interesting ways I mean just look at these popular Japanese phone designs from the mid 2000s they flip out they

  7: 24

rotate 90 degrees they have insanely intricate button layouts little holes for charms and completely insane Blobby

  7: 30

designs and it's not just the physical designs I mean just look at the web design people actually browse the

  7: 35

internet on this tiny screen stuffed with more text and information than a turkey on Thanksgiving to my Western

  7: 41

sensibilities it's like reading a novel on a postage stamp but apparently these sold very well in the Asian market which

  7: 47

is absolutely insane to me for comparison this was one of the best-selling phones designed for the Western Market just look at how all the

  7: 54

lines follow the same visual shape everything's far more organized and clean just a couple years after these

  8: 00

phones were launched Apple came around with possibly the most paired down design imaginable totally stealing the

  8: 07

show in the Western Market the iPhone really didn't catch on in Japan until they literally started giving them away

  8: 12

for free when you signed up for a new carrier plan this is actually fairly common now but it was very unusual in

  8: 19

the late 2000s before getting further into the differences between eastern and western cultures I want to clarify that

## East & West Is Only Telling A Small Part of the Story

  8: 25

the terms East and West don't even come close to representing the diversity of culture found within these two regions

  8: 30

Japan and China are completely different from each other and even within China different parts of the country have

  8: 36

totally different subcultures there are many individuals who are holistic thinkers in the west and many analytical

  8: 42

thinkers in the East plus as culture and markets become more Consolidated and globalized the differences between

  8: 48

designs are slowly becoming less pronounced in some product categories but using these broad categories still

  8: 55

helps us better understand a global design variations and cross-cultural collaboration the bigger Point here is

  9: 01

that there are very real psychological and processing differences between different cultures and it has a major

  9: 07

impact on which designs will be successful in their respective regions being born in a certain culture is like

## Being Born in A Culture Is Like Wearing Pink Glasses

  9: 13

always wearing a pair of pink glasses you completely forget that you're looking at everything through a cultural

  9: 18

filter until you meet someone else with blue glasses for example and they try to

  9: 23

show you how they see things broadly speaking westerners think in a linear fashion to us everything is a series of

  9: 30

step-by-step causal relationships that can be broken down into smaller and smaller parts it's kind of like the line

  9: 36

you see here this was drawn by Richard Nisbet a psychology professor at University of Michigan then on the right

  9: 43

you have the same diagram made by one of nisbet's chinese-american students this

  9: 48

is how East Asians tend to see things it's a series of interrelated pieces that all fit within each other once

  9: 55

again these generalizations don't apply to every single individual in the culture I interviewed several Asian

  10: 00

designers for this video and some of them have much more linear thought processes and traits than I do your

  10: 06

preferences and thought process can even change throughout the day depending on your mood but on average these

  10: 11

differences in thought process between East and West are pretty Stark Western thinking and culture are actually very

  10: 18

new and highly unusual compared to other cultures so how did the West get so

  10: 24

weird there are many reasons but here are a few of the major factors that I learned about from Richard Nisbet and

  10: 29

Joseph Henrik remember what I said about the pink glasses analogy well you've been wearing them all your life so now

  10: 35

it's time to put on the blue Shades probably some opportunity for some Matrix analogy take the red pill and I

  10: 42

show you how deep the rabbit hole goes it all started in ancient Greece Greeks had a systematic drive to categorize the

## Why Is Western Culture & Design Like That?

  10: 49

world around them and dissect it into isolated digestible chunks this obsession with categorization wasn't

  10: 56

just an intellectual exercise it was a reflection of how they saw themselves as

  11: 02

singular units the concept of individuality was as Greek as olive oil the Greeks even boldly separated

  11: 08

themselves from nature in fact you could argue that they invented the concept of

  11: 13

nature we take this distinction for granted now but this was totally unprecedented in the ancient world

  11: 18

unlike Eastern philosophies which viewed humans and the world around on them as harmoniously connected the Greeks made

  11: 25

the separation between man and nature some argue that this separation set the stage for scientific inquiry scientific

  11: 31

study and formal logic is pretty much entirely about stripping away context and just getting down to the basic

  11: 37

structure of an argument once again isolated digestible chunks now our

  11: 43

modern Western World still carries the Greek Legacy not just in philosophy or science but even in design think of the

  11: 50

minimalist trends that strip objects down to their Bare Essentials leaving just a skeleton of form devoid of

  11: 56

context for information but you might be asking what does ancient Greece have to do with the West a lot of the concepts

  12: 02

surrounding Greek individuals thinking were adopted by the Romans and eventually Christian thinkers especially

  12: 07

Saint Augustine which allowed these ideals to spread throughout Europe just to be clear some Asian civilizations

  12: 14

especially China were literally centuries ahead of Greece in terms of technological advancements they just

  12: 21

didn't concern them ourselves with formal logic and the scientific method in the same way that the Greeks did so

  12: 26

that was the first factor in Western culture branching out from the rest of the world but the Western push towards

  12: 33

individualist thinking got even more pronounced through one thing Banning

  12: 38

cousin marriage yep that's right I know this sounds like the beginning of a bad joke but I promise the church's ban on

  12: 44

cousin marriage is very relevant to Western design principles if you don't trust me trust Joseph Henrik he's a

  12: 51

Harvard Professor who spent the last several decades researching the phenomenon around how Western culture became so individualistic and I read his

  12: 58

500 page book so you don't have to let's get into this little accident that changed the course of history it's

  13: 03

important to note that in most parts of the world marrying your cousins is actually not that unusual most societies

  13: 10

were organized around robust kinship-based systems and strategic marriages to relatives and Europe and

  13: 17

most of the world wealth and land was passed down from generation to gen generation through inheritance marriage

  13: 24

played a pivotal role in solidifying these social ties and inheritance rights if a man died his widow often married

  13: 31

his brother ensuring that wealth and assets remained within the family it's ridiculous but something happened

  13: 37

around the Middle Ages that began to unravel this tight social fabric the church outlawed marrying even distant

  13: 44

relatives and Marion close family carried severe penalties including the stripping away of inheritance rights now

  13: 51

this wasn't some Grand Design to topple kinship-based societies it was largely an unintended consequence and so we

  13: 59

observed one of the most fascinating shifts in societal Evolution with weaker family chains came stronger individual

  14: 06

links loyalties once directed towards family and kin groups began to scatter redirecting towards the church and later

  14: 13

to things like Charter towns universities and guilds it's as if the social gravitational pull had

  14: 19

fundamentally shifted and suddenly we see the rise of individualism you had more of a say around who you wanted to

  14: 25

be as an individual and who you wanted to associate with and it's all because the church didn't want you to kiss your

  14: 31

cousin damn it I don't think I should say damn it sometimes history's most transformative form forces happen

  14: 36

completely by accident if you liked hearing that story as much as I like telling it you should subscribe but

  14: 42

anyway back to the video most other cultures adopted the Western model of marriage but it happened much later

  14: 48

China didn't even Outlaw marrying first cousins until 1980. I know it probably sounds crazy but if you read the data

  14: 55

yourself it's hard to deny I can't really go into too much more detail otherwise this is going to be a video

  15: 00

about cousin marriage rather than a video about how culture affects design so we've basically gone through the

  15: 06

first two filters for individualism first it was ancient Greek thought and then it was the ban on cousin marriage

  15: 12

but Western thought became even more individualistic with the beginning of protestantism the Protestant Reformation

  15: 19

of the 16th century was a major moment in history that put the final stamp on

  15: 24

Western individualism and analytical thinking basically Martin Luther was a priest who was tired of the church

  15: 30

abusing its power he wanted Christianity to be more about a personal relationship with the divine line rather than

  15: 36

something that was filtered through what he considered to be a corrupt institution the thing that made protestantism so unusual was that the

  15: 44

spirituality became an intensely personal Journey a direct line between the individual and the Divine the core

  15: 51

belief of protestantism was that everyone should read the Bible for themselves the truth was in the

  15: 56

scripture not in any sort of larger institution that was potentially corrupt you can't understand scripture unless

  16: 02

you can read so this led to a huge spike in literacy rates first in Europe and then globally and widespread literacy

  16: 09

didn't just mean more people reading it transformed human cognition memory improved visual processing took a leap

  16: 16

and problem solving skills sharpened protestantism placed individuals personal commitments at core of their

  16: 23

life okay so we just went through about 2 000 years of world history in five minutes here's the payoff with all three

  16: 30

of these factors the West was primed for the rise of individualized products and

  16: 36

brands in a world focused on the self the things that you buy signal what you value expressing who we are through the

  16: 43

things we buy is a very Western concept the sensibility still exists in the East but studies show that it's not nearly as

  16: 49

pronounced and hunter-gatherer societies such as the hadza tribe this impulse to express individuality through the things

  16: 56

that you own literally does not exist in fact the concept of ownership barely

  17: 02

even exists in those cultures possibly one of the best examples of buying products to reflect what was valued in

  17: 08

Europe were pocket watches the pocket watch was invented within a few years of the Protestant Reformation and I don't

  17: 15

think that's a coincidence these watches symbolize diligence punctuality and wealth they also represent the Western

  17: 21

analytical perspective on time before the Middle Ages in Europe having a precise measure of time really wasn't

  17: 27

that important the watch signifies a broader transition towards analytical efficiency and this mentality still

  17: 33

persists today with high-end wrist watches costing tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of dollars

  17: 39

now we've gone over Western individualism but what about the East where do their design sensibilities stem

## Why is Eastern Culture & Design Like That?

  17: 45

from the main doctrines of East Asian culture began in ancient China Chinese social life was interdependent and

  17: 52

Harmony was critically important it was about the balance between yourself your community and with nature it was a world

  17: 58

that looks beyond the individual and towards the collective the primary moral system of ancient China was Confucianism

  18: 05

it was less focused on metaphysics or religion and more focused on Common Sense practical ethics many Confucian

  18: 12

ideals were focused on obligations to other people in your community it was about avoiding friction within the

  18: 17

family the village and ultimately to align with the higher callings of the emperor everyone who knew their roles

  18: 23

their Mutual responsibilities and where they fit into the larger system the world was complicated events were

  18: 29

interrelated and people were connected not as pieces of the pie but as ropes in a net this wasn't stark contrast to the

  18: 36

Greek idea that everything was straightforward and knowable philosophy in China was less about finding truth

  18: 41

and more about practical action now to be clear that social harmony should not be confused with Conformity Confucian

  18: 47

ideals still encouraged people to distinguish themselves but it was to be done in a way that was harmonious rather

  18: 53

than being arrogant or showing off a key theme in eastern cultures is resonance when you pluck a string on an instrument

  18: 59

you produce a resonance or vibration on all the other strings man Heaven and

  19: 05

Earth create resonance in each other if the emperor does something wrong it throws the universe out of kilter it was

  19: 11

all about context and in this fascinating Society your life your thoughts and your Deeds are never just

  19: 18

yours they're part of an interconnected reality it's not about out individual liberty it's about Collective Harmony

  19: 25

even opposing forces reached an equilibrium or harmonious balance probably the best visual representation

  19: 31

of this ideal which almost all of you have seen is the yin yang symbol also known as the Tai G2 the Thai G2 is an

  19: 37

ancient Chinese symbol that describes duality in all things it represents the interconnected and interdependent forces

  19: 44

where opposite elements are not in Conflict but are complementary when Yin grows too strong Yang Rises to restore

  19: 52

equilibrium notice the dots in ever again there's a seed of Yang and vice

  19: 57

versa this is a philosophical nod to the ancient Chinese concept that every force or thing contains a flicker of its

  20: 03

opposite light is defined by Darkness pleasure is shaped by pain these dots

  20: 09

represent dynamic balance no single element ever truly dominates the Thai G2

  20: 14

stands as a Timeless symbol of balance and Harmony in natural systems this balance is manifested in many ways

  20: 21

throughout Eastern culture but perhaps most explicitly in the practice of feng

  20: 27

shui this ancient Chinese practice involves arranging the environment to create Harmony and balance and to

  20: 32

promote the flow of positive energy or Qi feng shui and other Eastern design philosophies try to consider the broader

  20: 38

picture a lot of it is very practical like how to place furniture and other elements in a room to maximize flow and

  20: 44

energy through the space this means allowing light to pour into the rooms more efficiently making it easier to

  20: 50

move through a space and being able to see what's going on around you while sitting down this channel called dear

  20: 55

modern actually has some awesome videos that show how to apply Feng Shui design principles sometimes feng shui even gets

  21: 02

into the metaphysical aspects of design it's why this Hong Kong Skyline has several holes in it these are gates to

  21: 09

allow dragons to pass through pretty wild stuff but this holistic approach isn't just exclusive to China Korea has

  21: 15

similar practices and even Japanese design principles focus on the interconnectedness of all life which is

  21: 21

a common theme in both Buddhist and Shinto Customs as I mentioned at the beginning of the video so how did this

## How Geography Changes Culture & Design

  21: 26

happen well it's more than just philosophy or religion it's also about the land we inhabit Southern China with

  21: 33

its rolling Fields emphasized rice cultivation as their main crop rice

  21: 38

paddies require cooperation between many people and this Reliance on community influenced the holistic approach

  21: 44

intrinsic to East Asian culture in contrast about 85 percent of Grease is covered by mountains which were less

  21: 50

conducive to farming but ideal for herding trading and fishing which required less Cooperative effort

  21: 56

Greece's major port cities were melting pots where people from all over the world would come to trade Greeks were

  22: 01

exposed to diverse Customs cultures and beliefs fostering curiosity and individualism Richard Nisbet is quoted

  22: 07

saying that ancient Athens would have been like a Star Wars Cantina almost contrast this with Eastern China where

  22: 13

at least 95 percent of people were ethnically Han Chinese and they were culturally very similar to each other

  22: 19

remember there's still significant diversity in thought Within in all countries regions dominated by Patty

  22: 25

rice cultivation like Southern China tend to have more holistic thinking patterns but areas suitable for wheat

  22: 31

and corn cultivation like northern China tend to favor more analytical thinking it's all about the level of cooperation

  22: 37

needed to survive the more the land is dedicated to Patty rice or other Cooperative efforts the stronger the

  22: 43

collectivist thinking geography and philosophy can impact culture and design but there's another thing that takes it

## How Language Changes Culture & Design

  22: 49

even further language language isn't just a tool for communication it's a lens through which we interpret and

  22: 55

shape our reality recently a designer friend of mine who happens to be a native German speaker gave me a great

  23: 01

example she used the example of the word for vacuum cleaner in German which is Staub sagra this literally translates to

  23: 07

dust sucker now imagine you're a designer and someone asks you to create a dust sucker the terminology alone has

  23: 13

narrowed your creative Horizon the word itself leaves little room for interpretation or reinvention in Turkish

  23: 19

a vacuum cleaner is called an electric superguesse it is

  23: 26

the literal translation is electrical broom imagine being a designer tasked with crafting an electrical broom versus

  23: 33

a dust sucker the different words already plant the seeds for two very distinct products the concept that I'm

  23: 39

describing is called The sapier Wharf hypothesis this Theory suggests that the language you speak can influence how you

  23: 45

see the world while the extent of this impact is still up for debate it's intriguing to think that the very words

  23: 50

you use can shape your world view one thing I can say with certainty is that the way you frame a problem can

  23: 55

completely change the way you design things what if I threw out the rule book and just said design a way to clean dirt

  24: 00

off the carpet just like that the floodgates are open you're no longer confined to an appliance perhaps you've

  24: 06

now ventured into the realm of other solutions that might not be a product at all maybe it's a cleaning service Donald

  24: 11

Trump here you know nobody sucks like me so introducing the I suck the newest in automated cleaning technology this is a

  24: 18

very common design thinking tool that demonstrates how a simple change of phrasing can completely change the scope

  24: 23

of a problem but could the sounds of the words views also impact our design decisions well there's no proof of this

  24: 29

but I can't help but believe that it does I mean consider the word butterfly in English in French it's Papillon or in

  24: 36

Italian it's and then there's German

  24: 42

this does relate to the difference between East and Western culture as well Richard Nisbet a cognitive psychologist

  24: 49

points out that topic prominent languages like Japanese Korean and Mandarin Chinese focus more on the

  24: 55

overall topic or theme rather than the subject of a sentence in these languages you might describe a scenario by saying

  25: 01

at this place skiing is good or the context the place is established before

  25: 07

we even get to what's good about it the scheme now contrast this with English or other Indo-European languages we would

  25: 14

say the skiing is good at this place you put the subject front and center and then the context follows remember those

  25: 20

tests that ask people to describe a scene featuring fish American subjects zeroed in on the fish themselves

  25: 26

sometimes barely referencing the surrounding context the Japanese subjects set the scene first describing

  25: 33

the environment and only then did they get into the details about the fish this is a reflection of how language can

  25: 39

Channel our perceptions and thought patterns but it's not just the structure of the sentence that matters sometimes

  25: 44

it's the very words themselves when Mercedes-Benz was marketing their cars in China they found out that the

  25: 50

pronunciation of Ben's at least in Chinese sounded kind of like the phrase for Rush to your death unsurprisingly

  25: 57

they opted for a quick Rebrand even our perception of color can be influenced by this the himba tribe in Namibia for

  26: 03

example has no word for the color blue in their language blue is just another shade of green when they're shown colors

  26: 10

with green and then what we would call Blue they have a hard time distinguishing between the two colors

  26: 15

even though the himba tribe struggled English-speaking people or other people who have a word for blue were able to

  26: 21

easily distinguish the two colors now here's where it gets really weird the himba tribe is very good at

  26: 27

distinguishing between slightly different shades of green way better than any westerners are it's just the

  26: 33

blue that they have trouble with probably because there's no word for the color in their language behind every design is a series of linguistic

  26: 39

influences all subtly shaping what you see how you see it and even how it was

  26: 44

created okay so I think I set up a pretty clear case that culture heavily influences design and even the way that

  26: 51

you see the world but one of the most important aspects of design is the process the process determines the

## How Culture Informs Design PROCESS

  26: 58

result as much as anything else it's like making a recipe you can have the exact same ingredients but if you pan

  27: 04

fry one burger and boil another identical Burger you're going to end up with very different results that's a

  27: 11

burger that I'm heating up yeah the process dictates the results as

  27: 17

much as anything else and please don't ever boil a burger yeah so let's talk about Western design processes as you

  27: 23

know Western thought has been heavily influenced by the Greek philosophers like Aristotle Aristotle hated

  27: 29

contradiction and so do most westerners they're very uncomfortable with it I mean just take Aristotle's law of

  27: 34

non-contradiction for instance notice the wording there it's not just a guideline it's a law in Western culture

  27: 40

this quest for Clarity and Singularity is found in everything from management strategies to design practices I mean

  27: 46

you've heard all the maxims before less is more good design is as little design as possible the goal is to keep things

  27: 52

direct clear and concise the thing is in context-rich Asian cultures this design

  27: 58

philosophy just doesn't apply at all I guess diorama's ideas of good design is as little design as possible could work

  28: 04

in an Eastern culture Eastern designers and customers might have a very very different idea of what constitutes as

  28: 11

little design as possible especially when you consider the fact that people from Eastern cultures can process so much more visual information I mean look

  28: 18

at this black Decker rice cooker next to this Zojirushi rice cooker while Dita ROMs didn't design the Black and Decker

  28: 24

rice cooker it definitely embodies his minimalist principles the Zojirushi design is apparently a great design but

  28: 30

the forms are very elliptical and Blobby plus I mean look at the buttons they're all laid out in a strange way it doesn't

  28: 35

really make sense at least to Western sensibilities the point is this is definitely not as little design as as

  28: 41

possible by Western standards but it's a best-selling design in Japan and a great product overall it's important to note

  28: 47

that minimalist design is found in both Western countries and throughout East Asia but their underlying motivations

  28: 53

and expressions are very different Japanese minimalism has its roots in philosophies like wabi-sabi and Ma which

  29: 00

value the beauty of imperfection and the importance of negative space the wabi-sabi design style has its roots in

  29: 06

Zen Buddhist principles and aims to create a Serene contemplative environment it's also important to note

  29: 12

that while this Japanese design philosophy is over a thousand years old it only gained popularity in the West in

  29: 18

the early 20th century I'm pretty sure that the modern minimalist design philosophy you see in Japanese design

  29: 24

today is actually more of a response to Western tastes although I can't prove this but one thing I can say is that

  29: 30

while Western audiences often associate Japanese design with minimalism many traditional Japanese designs are

  29: 36

intricate and functionally very complex European minimalism on the other hand and leans heavily on functionalism and

  29: 42

rationalism with influences from the Bauhaus and Scandinavian design movements geometric forms industrial

  29: 48

materials like metal and glass and a monochromatic color palette characterize this style while Japanese minimalism

  29: 54

seeks to provide a space for Spiritual holistic contemplation European minimalism aims for efficiency and

  30: 00

Clarity interestingly the context prominent nature of Japanese language May mirror its designs focused on the

  30: 06

broader context while the subject prominent structure of European languages might align with a more object-centric approach to minimalism

  30: 13

this avoidance of contradiction bleeds into the tools westerners use for analysis and problem solving as well if

  30: 19

you're from a western culture you're probably not in your head thinking yeah of course who could argue with the law of non-contriction but it's not so

  30: 26

simple consider the SWOT analysis commonly used in business and design settings it categorizes product features

  30: 32

as strengths weaknesses opportunities or threats simple enough right but what if something is both a strength and a

  30: 39

weakness an edge to edge display on a phone creates a great viewing experience but the device is more fragile and can

  30: 45

crack more easily Western models like SWAT or even design methodologies that emphasize clear goals and personas often

  30: 52

sacrifice Nuance for the sake of clarity for example Journey maps are a design strategy used to create a linear

  30: 58

Narrative of user experience overlooking the messiness and unpredictability of real life these models aren't without

  31: 04

Merit but they can be very narrow in their scope and should be used as part of a broader context for making

  31: 10

decisions they work well in a western context but their utility can diminish in cultures with different conceptual

  31: 16

foundations a mind map is an example of a more holistic tool and maybe it would work better in eastern context I'm not

  31: 23

really sure I'm not saying that these tools are good or bad I'm just saying that we shouldn't assume that these tools and processes are the go-to

  31: 30

solution even something as foundational as the law of contradiction can be worth questioning in the right context as we

## Is A Singular Design Vision Really Necessary?

  31: 36

move to Eastern cultural sensibilities we find a completely different cultural comfort with country prediction think

  31: 41

about the philosophy of Yin and Yang again where opposites coexist within a harmonious Circle in East Asia it's

  31: 48

common to find designs that juggle multiple themes or even conflicting elements I mean just look at this phone

  31: 53

for example you've got some Stripes then you got some more stripes then these Stripes sort of curve around this giant

  31: 59

black circular camera array then they put the flash over here to the side but it doesn't quite line up right wait till

  32: 05

you see this I think it's wild the black camera array isn't even symmetrical they decided to put some text underneath one

  32: 10

of the lenses so this one is just bumped up further than the others then they put what I believe are Chinese characters on

  32: 15

the side here but it's in between the two stripes which make the two elements visually Clash like in a really strange

  32: 20

way and then you've got the English tagline where technology is spelled wrong it's like a typo I mean if I'm

  32: 26

being honest from a western perspective this design is a disaster but at the same time this isn't really like any

  32: 32

phone I've seen in the Western Market where everybody just tries to copy Apple it's not my personal cultural taste but

  32: 37

at least they have a Fresh Approach if you've embraced Western design principles your entire life it's tempting to believe that a singular

  32: 44

vision is the only way to make a masterpiece and I've even said this before but maybe that's not universally

  32: 49

true maybe a variety of ideas can enrich a design rather than muddle it take a cue from Kai ping Ping's research which

  32: 56

found that East Asians often perceive both positive and negative emotions in the same exact facial expression now

  33: 03

apply this to design imagine a design that invites contradictory feelings calmness and excitement Nostalgia and

  33: 09

futurism all at once this is almost certainly too chaotic for Western design sensibilities but it could be really

  33: 15

interesting in certain contexts it should be noted that East Asians don't have any problem with formal logic it's

  33: 20

not like they don't understand the law of non-contradiction it's just that they don't use it in their daily life as

  33: 26

often as westerners while this probably does lead to logical errors it's not like the Western fear of contradiction

  33: 32

doesn't also produce errors the need for consistency and non-contradiction in Western cultures can lead to

  33: 38

oversimplification or outright dismissal of complex nuanced issues now you really

  33: 44

can't talk about design in the East without mentioning the fact that China has been known to copy Western intellectual property some people argue

## Copying

  33: 51

that maybe it's an Eastern cultural thing and to be fair the importance of giving credit to individuals is actually

  33: 57

a very Western concept after all and maybe that's a part of it but I really don't think that's telling the whole

  34: 02

story the theft of intellectual properties from more developed countries is unfortunately very common in the 18th

  34: 08

and 19th centuries the United States was still a developing Nation it would sometimes steal intellectual property

  34: 14

from Britain Samuel Slater famously known as Slater the traitor by the British memorized designs of textile

  34: 21

Machinery before copying the designs and moving to the U.S Britain had strict laws against exporting this technology

  34: 28

Germany was also known for taking technological and scientific knowledge from Britain and other industrialized

  34: 33

countries but now a couple hundred years later both Germany and the United States are well established in generating their

  34: 40

own in intellectual property and I do think that intellectual property theft is a legitimate problem in a lot of

  34: 46

countries especially China the bigger point I'm trying to make is that a lot of people try to chalk it up as an East

  34: 52

Asian thing but it really is more of a developing country thing looking towards the future we have an exciting

## What Should You DO?

  34: 58

opportunity to blend the best of all cultural perspectives to tackle the challenges we face it's not easy it

  35: 05

means moving past our deep-seated beliefs and values but it's absolutely worth it by adjusting our approaches

  35: 10

questioning our own understandings and opening our minds to others experiences we're shaping a unified World rich in

  35: 18

shared knowledge and endless potential together let's build a world that's interconnected enlightened and stronger

  35: 24

than ever before and that starts by understanding each other I hope you learned as much from watching this video

  35: 29

as I did making it every time I launch one of these videos it absolutely destroys me encapsulating these really

  35: 47

out a lot too if you want to see the full 100 pages of notes from this video it's on patreon big shout out to my

  35: 53

existing patrons if we manage to get enough new patrons I can start making videos that are tailored to exactly what

  35: 59

you want to learn about a lot of you asked me to bring back my design analysis series but I can't really do

  36: 05

that because they just don't get enough views for Better or For Worse the views are what pay for these videos but if I

  36: 10

have enough patreon support we can talk about exactly what we want to talk about if you can't afford it or you don't want

  36: 16

to pay that's totally okay there's no pressure here but as always have a great day and I hope you learned something
