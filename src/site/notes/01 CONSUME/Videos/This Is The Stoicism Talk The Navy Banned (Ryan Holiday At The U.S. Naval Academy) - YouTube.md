## Intro: Stoicism, Censorship & Admiral Stockdale

0:00

i was supposed to give a talk at the Naval Academy today i just found out about 20 minutes before I was supposed to go on that it's not happening because

0:07

I was going to talk about this reaction against controversial ideas or ideas

0:12

that we disagree with i've loved my time here at the Naval Academy it's been one of the honors of my life i'm terribly

0:18

sad and somewhat bewildered this amazing institute of higher learning is now

0:23

banning books and not just banning books but not allowing criticism of that decision as well some people have

0:30

resigned in protest over it i felt like I couldn't in good conscience go and deliver this

0:40

lecture now I am back home and on my flight home I thought I don't want to

0:47

allow that to happen they can prevent me from going on

## The Speech the Navy Didn‚Äôt Want You to Hear

0:54

stage but they can't prevent me from delivering the talk so I'm going to give the talk that I was going to give at the

0:59

Naval Academy now this is obviously a slightly different environment i was planning to do it on stage i was

1:05

planning to have slides behind me i was planning to address you know a thousand people in person and that's a little bit

1:11

different than doing it here in my studio in Texas but here's more or less

1:16

the talk that I would have given to those midshipmen and the idea that the obstacle is the way now anyone and

1:21

everyone can watch it hopefully it will reach a larger audience than it was going to reach had everything gone as

1:29

planned so whoever you are wherever you are but most of all if you're at the

1:34

Naval Academy I hope this resonates with you and with that said let's talk about

## Wisdom is Work

1:41

wisdom i want to take you back to the summer of 1943 a young man from Illinois is sworn

1:49

in and inducted the Naval Academy and so as a young James Stockdale gathers with

1:56

his fellow plebes to be sworn in to the Naval Academy as World War II rages

2:02

across the globe he swears his oath to the Constitution and to the country and

2:08

his father who had dreamed for many years that his son would one day enter the Naval Academy gives him a parting

2:15

word of advice he says "I want you to try to be the best man in that hall."

2:21

Now what did he mean by this when he urged his son to try to be the best man

2:27

at the Naval Academy did he mean class rank now ultimately James Stockdale

2:33

ranks about 130th in his class at the Naval Academy which although impressive is I think by no means the best so his

2:40

father must have meant it at some other level and certainly Stockdale himself understood it at another level and later

2:47

that month he writes a letter home and and the advice from his father is still pinging around in his head he said "Dad

2:54

when you left you told me you wanted me to be the best man in that hall and I'm going to try to do that." I think what

3:00

his father was saying was something similar actually to a piece of advice that a stoic philosopher gave another

3:07

great soldier Pompy the Great as he set out to battle pirates in the Mediterranean he stops in to visit the

3:15

stoic philosopher Posidonius and he asks him if he has any advice for him before he departs and Posedonius says quoting

3:23

the Odyssey that you must be best and always superior to others now again was

3:30

Postidonius referring to winning all of the battles was he referring to the

3:35

greatest conquests or the greatest feats of intellectual achievement or piling up

3:42

the most money i I don't think so he was of course referring to the idea of virtue the stoic virtues of courage

3:49

discipline justice and wisdom he's saying be the most virtuous man be

3:55

superior to others in that sense this is what Stockdale's father was advising his

4:01

son reminds me of another story about two Spartan wrestlers who after a long

4:06

hard battle wins and as the other reaches up his hand to shake that of the

4:12

victor he says "The better man won." The wrestler who won corrects him and he says "No the better wrestler." It's a

4:19

story about sportsmanship but also this same idea that winning is not everything

4:26

class rank is not everything rank is not everything achievements are not

4:31

everything but who you are the standards you hold yourself to the character that

4:37

you possess this is everything and certainly when they say the better man

4:42

won or they say be the best man in that hall these were different times when

4:48

Stockdale entered the Naval Academy in 43 as part of the class of 47 although

4:54

he graduates in 46 because of the war women are not allowed in the Naval

5:00

Academy it is in fact not until 1980 that Elizabeth Row and Janie Mines are

5:06

the two first female graduates of the academy these two powerful inspiring

5:12

women are a reminder that as the Stoics in fact talked about there is nothing

5:18

gendered about virtue or greatness long before the controversies about DEI

5:25

Mousonius Rufus the philosophy teacher of Epictitus is not only teaching a

5:30

slave like Epictitus but writes a fascinating essay about why women also

5:35

need to be taught philosophy he would say that it should be obvious that there

5:42

is not a different set of virtues for men and women that virtue is virtue

5:49

arrit excellence is excellence courage discipline justice and wisdom is

5:55

demanded of each of us as individuals and that it is what we ought to aspire

6:01

to whoever we are whatever we do it is the compass that guides us it is our

6:08

true north and there is a reason that wisdom is considered the mother of the

6:15

virtues because it tells us when to apply courage it tells us what is right and what is wrong it tells us what the

6:20

right amount of things are tells us what to resist and what to accept wisdom is

6:27

probably the most ineffable of the virtues it is hard to define it is many

6:32

things of course it's being smart and it's knowledge and facts and it's insight it's intelligence and intuition

6:40

it's experience and education and philosophy and practical understanding and awareness and wit and perspective

6:47

and precipacity it's it's even the prudence as the ancients sometimes

6:52

called wisdom it's all these things and more and yet it's also quite simple i

6:59

would say wisdom is knowing what's what what what you need to do here what matters here what counts here what to do

7:07

when to do it and how to do it and while we might quibble over the exact definition of wisdom I think we can all

7:14

agree that it's not something you're born with it's not something that someone can give you wisdom is something

7:19

you have to earn it's something you have to get it's not something that can be given as Senica would say no one is wise

7:26

by chance certainly we can all agree about that you have to earn it it is the result of toil and struggle and trial

7:34

and error and so many things wisdom is work and it's really the work of our

7:39

lives and that's what I want to talk about today it was certainly the work of Stockdale's life he graduates from the

7:45

Naval Academy in 46 then he spends almost 20 years in the Navy rises to the

7:52

rank of commander and then he's sent to Stanford to get a master's degree now it

7:58

might seem strange that the Navy would send a fighter pilot in their late30s to Stanford to get an advanced degree but

8:04

Stockdale knew exactly why he was there and in fact he was a bit frustrated his first year or so at Stanford he said

8:12

that one of the things that struck him was that he'd taken all these classes he'd spent all this time but the one

8:19

thing that he hadn't gotten was wisdom he said "I was lacking an inspiration or a pole star to guide me." He'd just been

8:26

processing relatively tedious material at first and then as he walked through the halls of Stanford one day a man

8:34

approaches him at first confusing him for a fellow professor and this man is named Philip Rinlander rinlander had

8:41

himself served in the Navy during World War II and he asks Stockdale what he's doing and what he's looking for and they

8:47

strike up a friendship and in the way that the hero's journey often involves

8:53

the seeking out of a mentor Rhinellander becomes this for Stockdale and he gives

8:58

him a book off of his shelf he reaches behind him and he grabs the incoridian of Epictitus and he hands him this book

9:05

a book that would change the course of Stockdale's life as Marcus Reis would

9:10

say that a mastery of reading and writing requires a master so does life and so in this way Rinlander becomes a

9:18

mentor and a teacher to Stockdale he spends countless hours in his office getting reading recommendations and life

9:24

advice discussing big ideas and ultimately takes Rinlander's course in philosophy as it happens this

## Introduction to Epictetus

9:31

introduction to Epictitus is a rather timeless encounter marcus Aurelius

9:38

himself would be introduced to the writings of Epictitus by his philosophy teacher Junius Rusticus he thanks him at

9:46

the beginning of meditations for loaning him his copy of Epictitus from his own library and these may have been notes on

9:51

Epictitus' lectures that Rusticus wrote down himself having perhaps attended

9:57

some of Epictitus' lectures in any case Marcus would say that just as a mastery

10:03

of reading and writing requires a master so does life i think in Stockdale's case

10:09

the meeting of the teacher is an essential part of the hero's journey the person who opens up the door who gives

10:17

us the material we need who teaches us marcus Aurelius has this teacher not just in Rusticus who he remains close to

10:26

for the rest of their remaining lives but he is given a second gift when he is

10:31

adopted by the emperor Hadrien and Hadrien senses that Marcus is too young to become emperor by himself so he

10:38

adopts a powerful senator named Antonyinus who in turn adopts Marcus Aurelius hadrien probably imagines that

10:45

Antonyinus will live for a few years instead Antonyinus lives for more than

10:50

two decades and Marcus decides to learn under him instead of them becoming

10:56

rivals instead of seeing Antonyinus as an impediment Marcus assumes the role of

11:01

a willing student of an apprentice and gets 20 years of on the job teaching

11:07

history affords us almost no other example of two heirs to the throne

11:13

getting along in such a fashion learning from each other in such a fashion and

11:19

when you read the effusive praise that Marcus gives Antonyinus and all the things that he learns from him the

11:26

beginning of meditations you are given a textbook example of what good mentorship

## What Good Mentorship Looks Like

11:32

looks like admiral Michelle Howard a class of 82 graduate of the Naval Academy would say that we sort of have

11:38

two choices in life we can try to figure things out on our own and stumble or we can talk to someone who has had the same

11:45

shared experiences we can learn by trial and error or we can learn from the

11:52

experiences of others that's the choice that we get to make this question of who we are apprenticed under who are we

11:57

learning from who is our guide who is opening doors for us is one of the most essential questions of our education and

12:03

are we really listening because as the stoics say you know it is impossible to learn that which you think you already

12:09

know ego gets in the way our ambition gets in the way our entitlements get in

12:16

the way our conceit gets in the way there's a famous statue of Nero who was

12:23

also given a great teacher he is attached to Senica himself one of the wisest minds in the ancient world and he

12:31

too had the opportunity for years and years of on the job study but he resents Senica's leadership and as you can see

12:38

in the statue the body language resembles that of the petulent teenager it resembles the person whose ego tells

12:44

them that they already know everything they need to know it is the sulking petulant

12:50

closeminded deliberate ignorance of a petty narcissist all the things that

12:56

Nero was and all the things that ultimately proved to be his undoing look

13:02

learning is not always fun mentors are not always nice the course they set out for us is not always easy but as

13:09

Epictitus said as Stockdale would have read in his copy of the Encidian the

13:14

philosopher's lecture hall is a hospital it's painful he says "You shouldn't walk

13:19

out of it feeling good or pleasurable but you should still be in pain because you weren't well when you entered." The

13:26

work the rework the changes the remedies that philosophy applies to us that the

13:33

doctor that is our teacher subjects us to won't always be fun and it will take

13:38

time to recover but where we end up that is what matters and that is what's important our greatest mentor has to be

## The Past is Our Greatest Teacher

13:47

the past although our teachers are essential the most accessible teacher is the past cleo the goddess of history is

13:55

there and prepared to mentor and teach all of us patton famously believed he

14:00

was the reincarnated spirit of countless warriors from the past as he would write

14:07

in a famous poem so as through a glass and darkly the agelong strife I see

14:14

where I fought in many guises many names but always me and there is a story about

14:21

him touring a civil war battlefield where the awful and violent battle of the wilderness was fought and as he

14:27

discussed the battle with his tour guide he began to argue saying that the tour guide's version of events were incorrect

14:34

that it had happened this way and the troops had traveled that way and as the argument got heated an old man walked up

14:41

to him and and said "No no no the general here is correct i was at this

14:46

battle as a boy." And that's precisely how it went and Patton too believed that

14:51

he had been there as a boy and that this experience remained within him in some

14:57

form and as convincing as Patton's belief in this sort of mystical

15:04

otherworldly cycle of regeneration is I I think there's actually an easier and

15:10

in some ways more impressive explanation which is that as a young boy Patton was

15:17

almost debilitatingly dyslexic he did not write or read until he was 12 years old his parents actually kept him out of

15:25

school boy were worried that he would never do these things they wondered if he was mentally disabled in some form

15:32

but instead of giving up on their son what they did was they read to him a lot his aunt nanny read to her favorite

15:40

nephew constantly and so did his father they read him the Odyssey and every classic they could get their hands on

15:45

his father also used uh his connections to bring in Civil War veterans and

15:52

politicians and any well-known person that he could meet and Patton would button hole them and ask them every

15:57

question he possibly could he grew up surrounded by history history became

16:04

almost real to him these myths these legends these great moments great

16:11

battles these great personalities he had lived with them in a way that his fellow

16:17

school children never could have even imagined and Patton himself would hint

## The History of War & Life

16:23

that this is where his genius came from he he would say that the road to high command leads through the long path

16:29

called the history of war he said to be useful to you military knowledge not unlike discipline has to be subconscious

16:37

that simply memorizing is futile that an officer has to be soaked in military

16:44

lore to the point where the military thing becomes automatic becomes muscle

16:51

memory becomes part of their identity their sense of the world then this is what books ultimately became to Patton

16:57

who did learn to read and became a lifelong reader and was seen reading in all of his campaigns he read widely he

17:05

read critically it was said that by the time World War II broke out he had read nearly every book about war ever

17:12

published he read books about religious history he read books about psychology

17:17

he read books about economics he read books about everything he could get his hands on and the reason he did this the

17:24

reason that almost all great men and women have been great readers is that through history we annex as Senica said

17:32

all the eras and wisdom of the past into our own lives another great American

17:38

Harry Truman never goes to college but is a lover of books he said at one point that he believed he'd read nearly every

17:44

book in the library near his house as a kid and he would say that the only new

17:50

thing in the world is the history we do not yet know the reason people study

17:55

history is that it is literally a form of time travel literally a way to be

18:01

tipped off about the future and the founding of stoicism is itself an echo

18:08

of that bit of wisdom zeno the founder of stoicism is a young merchant he

18:13

travels the Mediterranean dealing in Tyrion purple that is the dye that would make the fanciest and brightest cloaks

18:20

of the Athenians and later the Romans until one day he suffers a shipwreck and he washes up penniless in Athens where

18:27

walking through the agora he stops by a book seller and he hears that book seller reading aloud a story of Socrates

18:35

asking the book seller where he can find a person like that he is introduced to his teacher the philosopher whose

18:41

nickname at that time was the door opener which is what great teachers do they open doors to other worlds to us it

18:49

was listening to that book seller listening to Socrates come alive a man who was at that point quite dead that a

18:57

prophecy that Zeno had heard as a young boy finally made sense to him he had asked the oracle at Deli "What is the

19:03

secret to a good life?" And the oracle had told him "You will become wise when you begin to have conversations with the

19:11

dead." And that's what Zena was doing there in the agora listening to that

19:16

book seller it's what I do every time I pick up a book it's what Patton was doing when he read it's what Stockdale

19:23

was doing when he was introduced to Epictitus they were participating in what we call the great conversation the

19:29

great works of antiquity the the authors of which are long since dead but they

19:34

feel alive to us on the page they come alive to us on the page it's why I

19:40

called my bookstore the painted porch after the stoopa poille where Zeno was

19:46

introduced to stoic philosophy and began to have his conversations with the dead reading is a superpower because when we

## Why Reading is a Super Power

19:54

are reading we are not just conversing with the dead who created it but all the dead people who have read that book

20:01

since your predecessors your ancestors who picked this book up in a library

20:07

whose parents read it to them who were recommended it by a friend whose lives were changed by the ideas in those books

20:15

the great General Mattis our former Secretary of Defense who spent 40 years in the Marine Corps would say that

20:20

reading is an honor and a gift he said it's a gift from a warrior or a historian who a decade ago or a thousand

20:28

decades ago they set time aside to write and they distilled their wisdom their

20:34

hard one experiences down into these pages to have this conversation with you it is a

20:41

gift it is a superpower why do we reject this gift it is insane who would decline

20:48

such a supernatural experience yet this is precisely what so many of us do to

20:53

follow breaking news to gossip to veg out in front of the television to

21:00

distract ourselves with social media we could be communing with the wisest minds

21:05

who ever lived we could be traveling through the centuries we could be being briefed on the future as Truman said by

21:13

studying the past and yet we choose not to do this it's not just reading of course as Mattis would say if if you

21:20

haven't read hundreds of books you are functionally illiterate he said our own personal experiences are not broad

21:26

enough to sustain us i I would say that that reading occasionally is not enough

21:31

and simply reading is not enough we have to linger on the works of the master

21:37

thinkers senica said reading them and rereading them over and over again if we want to he says derive the ideas which

21:44

shall win firm hold in our mind that you have to understand the stoics are not authors you have read they are authors

21:51

you have to be reading you don't read meditations you are reading meditations

21:57

you haven't read epictitus you are reading epictitus after he was

22:03

introduced to the incuridian stock travels everywhere with his copy and

22:10

with related books he would say that on his bedside table no matter what carrier he was on he was deployed shortly after

22:16

his time at Stanford he carried his Epictitus books with him he had in

22:22

Coridian he had discourses he had Zenifan's memorabilia of Socrates which had so influenced Epictitus he said he

22:29

had the Iliad and the Odyssey because Epic Pedus expected all of his students to know the plots and the themes of the

22:36

Odyssey stockdale said that he didn't have time to be a bookworm while he was a fighter pilot but that he still spent

22:43

several hours buried in them each week i don't know what definition you have to

22:48

have of a bookworm to think that reading for several hours a week doesn't make you one but he was a bookworm and this

22:56

copy of Epictitus he reads not only on his deployment but for the rest of his

23:02

life my own copy of meditations is pretty worse for the wear after 20 odd

23:07

years with it its cover is falling off nearly every page is marked or folded

23:12

but that's the point i am not just reading it but rereading it and rereading it and each time I pick it up

23:18

I take something new out of it as Heracletus said how we we don't step in the same river twice although the book

23:24

doesn't change you change the world changes and thus you take something new out of it each time and I am communing

23:32

not just with Marcus Aurelius who's dead but I am communing with a younger version of myself who who captured a bit

23:39

of myself in these pages in these memorabilia that I left behind and I can see who I used to be what struck me then

23:47

i can disagree with myself i can talk with my younger more ignorant self as

23:53

well when I say that we have to read I don't just mean we read the popular books or we read the acceptable books we

## Why We Have to Read Critically and Dangerously

24:02

have to read critically we have to read dangerously senica said that we have to read like a spy in the enemy's camp and

24:09

this is what he was doing when he quotes Epicurus throughout his own writings he

24:14

says quoting bad authors even when the line is good senica wasn't afraid of a rival school of philosophy he wanted to

24:21

learn from them he wanted to absorb their wisdom too you could argue that the class that influences Stockdale the

24:28

most that he relies on most in the ordeal that lay ahead was actually not

24:34

Epictitas in the fall of 1961 he enrolled in a class he'd eagerly been

24:39

trying to get into which was a class on comparative Marxist thought and he said

24:44

that what struck him about the class is that they didn't read criticisms of Marx or summaries of Marxism they read only

24:53

the Marxists themselves he said "We read no criticism of Marxism only the primary sources." Says for almost a full year we

24:59

read nothing but the works of Marx and Lenon he was reading like a spy in the

25:04

enemy's camp he would write a letter home to his father that one of the things he learned from his parents is that you can't beat something you don't

25:11

understand that you will be better equipped to beat something you understand than something you don't

25:16

understand something you have closed your mind to and we should think about what Stockdale would think about the

## The 381 Books Banned From the Navel Academy Library

25:24

news that almost 400 books have been removed from the Naval Academy library

25:29

and that this was no accident but in fact the official policy of the United

25:35

States government and when I first saw the news on on April 1st I I suspected

25:40

at first that it was an April Fool's joke the idea that that the best and

25:46

brightest students in the country are seen as too fragile too easily

25:52

manipulatable too susceptible to be exposed to works that people don't like

25:59

or disagree with this transgresses the very ethos the the very purpose of

26:04

higher education which is to challenge which is to open doors which is to allow

26:11

you to understand things and understanding and being familiar with something is not the same as liking or

26:19

endorsing or embracing it the Naval Academy is not the only place where this energy is being directed in the small

## They Don't Gotta Burn the Books They Just Remove 'Em

26:26

town in Texas where I live where my bookstore is there was an effort to remove a number of books from the high

26:32

school library and thinking of the lyrics to one of my favorite Rage Against the Machine songs you know we think of censorship as the burning of

26:40

books but they don't burn books anymore what they do is they remove them they deprive us of our right to access them

26:47

and I partnered with this company Script and we just gave them out to every student who wanted them right because

26:52

when people tell you you shouldn't be allowed to read something you shouldn't be able to engage with an idea it is

26:58

precisely those ideas that intellectually curious people ought to go towards secure and confident and

27:05

smart people ought to try to understand and look one of the reasons we study history is is to understand that none of

## None of These Debates are New

27:11

these debates are new in the 1950s there was incredible political pressure to

27:18

censor what books could appear on federal installations largely on

27:23

embassies all over the world and in 1953 Eisenhower was asked about this at a

27:29

press conference you know would he ban communist books from US embassies and he

27:34

said "Look my view is that censorship and hiding solves nothing." And he

27:39

pointed out the fact that in the run-up to World War II as people were astonished and horrified by what

27:46

happened it was obvious in retrospect that more people should have read Minecom he said you know they laid it

27:52

out and we didn't read it he urged people to read Lenon and Stalin and Marx

27:59

he said if we're going to run a free government let's educate ourselves i just refuse to accept that young people

28:07

are sensitive little snowflakes who have to be protected there's a great dichotomy what kind of learner are you

28:13

are you a soldier or are you a scout even if you're training to be in the military you don't want to be a soldier

28:20

when it comes to learning a soldier is trying to defend what they know what

28:25

they've been taught a scout a scout reads dangerously reads curiously

28:31

plunges into unfamiliar territory gets behind enemy lines and seeks to

28:37

understand anything and everything particularly the things and the points

28:42

of view from the people they disagree with they steal man rather than straw man they investigate rather than

28:49

persecute this is what Senica was saying we must read like a spy in the enemy's camp i think it's essential to point out

28:56

here that the books that have been removed from the library at the Naval Academy are not Marxist texts or mine

29:03

comp they are in many cases art literature works of legitimate if not

29:09

controversial scholarship they are criticisms of America and American

29:16

history that is my Maya Angelou is not the enemy if Stockdale can can read the

29:23

enemy and try to understand it certainly can make room for some of our greatest

29:29

poets and writers and you never know when this information is going to be of use to you in the future when this

29:35

understanding when this curiosity will benefit you in the Hanoi Hilton where Stockdale was repeatedly interrogated

## How These Books & Ideas Will Benefit You

29:42

and tortured he was able to withstand in part the propaganda and the

29:49

misinformation and the barrage of criticism and questions that were thrown

29:55

at him because as he said he understood Marxist theory more than his

30:01

interrogators did he would tell of pushing back against one of his interrogators nicknamed Rabbit he said

30:07

that's not what Lenin said you're a deviationist you're paraphrasing you're you're deviating from the party line and

30:14

it was his familiarity with these ideas that allowed him to do that general Mark

30:20

Millie would talk about this in a congressional hearing that he's read Mao and Marx and Lenin said "This doesn't

30:25

make me a communist." Says "What's wrong with having situational understanding

30:31

about the country for which we are here to defend?" This is what great thinkers do this is how wise people educate

30:37

themselves because we are going to need to be able to deal with complexity and discomfort and contradiction the poet

30:44

John Keats would talk about this idea of negative capability as this beautiful metaphor of the mansion of many

30:50

apartments that there's these these different rooms and that the mark of a good mind was the ability to hold

30:58

contradictory ideas in it at the same time that America is good and has done

31:05

bad is one of those ideas that people are awful and people are heroic and

31:11

inspiring that issues can be simple and complex at the same time is a form of

31:16

complexity that a simple mind cannot handle admiral James Rickover class of

31:22

1922 at the Naval Academy the father of America's nuclear navy would say that so

31:27

many of our present ills stem from our chiding faith in the search for perfect answers he says it requires a degree of

31:35

maturity to realize that all solutions are partial and I would add to that that

31:40

things remain unclear things contradict each other things are confusing

31:46

understanding is sometimes elusive if you cannot handle that if you need things to be simple and clear you are

31:54

going to have a rough go of it particularly in this line of work if the history you are reading doesn't make you

## You're not Reading History if it Doesn't Make You Uncomfortable

32:01

uncomfortable you are not reading history if you are only looking for stuff that you agree with that confirms

32:07

or supports what you want to be true if your deepest held beliefs aren't regularly being challenged I don't know

32:13

what path you are on but it is not the path to wisdom things are not simple and if they are simple to you you are doing

32:19

it wrong we have to be able to think for ourselves right leaders must be

32:25

independent thinkers or they are by definition not leaders the famous charge

32:31

of the light brigade maybe you know the Tennyson poem about it or hopefully you know the Iron Maiden song about it but

32:38

the the Tennyson poem it's an illustration ultimately I think of this idea half a league half a league half a

32:45

league onward all in the valley of death rode the 600 forward the light brigade

32:52

charge for the guns he said into the valley of death rode the 600 forward the

32:58

light brigade was there a man dismayed not though the soldier knew but someone

33:05

had blundered theirs not to make reply theirs not to reason why theirs but to

33:12

do and die into the valley of death wrote the 600 but the 600 didn't need to

33:19

ride into the valley of death although their heroism was incredible it was also pointless and if at any point in the

33:26

process someone had seen and questioned what was so obviously a blunder had the

33:31

courage to push back on these deranged orders if the commanding officer himself

33:37

who knew that the charge was almost certainly mistaken had the courage to question what obviously resulted from a

33:45

miscommunication that heroism wouldn't have been necessary they could have been saved for another day and it was

33:51

precisely this hard-headedness this lack of independent thinking that Florence

33:58

Nightingale would bump into in the Crimean War where she fought with equal

34:04

heroism to introduce basic sanitation and medical reforms to prevent so many

34:11

men from needlessly dying in military hospitals she would lament that these

34:17

officers and their superiors their heads were so flattened by the boards of military discipline that they were

34:22

basically children and she spent needless energy fighting this resistance

34:29

this status quo bias energy that could have saved lives and and many many lives

34:34

many many men a generation of soldiers died needlessly because of the inability

34:41

to conceive of doing things differently rickover himself would say that

## Leaders Need Criticism, Feedback & to Be Challenged

34:47

subordinates who agree with their superiors are useless parts of the organization that leaders need criticism

34:54

and feedback and to be challenged and I would argue that all change all innovation it comes from this

35:00

disagreement it comes from these challenges it comes from this questioning i mean look at the history

35:07

of the Navy steam ships were resisted and ironclads were resisted and

35:13

submarines were resisted and aircraft carriers were resisted and so too was

35:20

integration so too was the allowing of women to enlist all along the way every

35:27

important change has been resisted the status quo has been upheld to so many

35:34

people's detriment we we have to figure out a way to respect tradition but despise convention to preserve

35:42

traditions that are worth preserving but be willing to embrace change and to

35:48

abhore complacency because our lives your careers the future one thing we can

35:54

say about it for certain is that it will be filled with change and disruption and innovation and new ideas and new

36:01

problems and those who are being trained for leadership are being selected for

36:06

their ability to think and to learn and to adapt to think for themselves that is what they bring to this future that is

36:12

how they will guide us and lead us in that future and that is what wisdom is made from and for the great physicist

36:20

Richard Feman was once told about some theory from a colleague and and Richard

36:26

said that's what are you talking about that none of that makes any sense and the colleague replied not

36:32

by defending the idea but by saying "Professor Fineman this theory has been commonly accepted for some time." And

36:40

Fineman looked at him and he said "So not only is it you're telling me it's old just because

36:47

something has been true for a long time just because it's been repeated just because it's comfortable doesn't mean it's right." As Rusticus would teach

36:55

Marcus Aurelius we can't fall for every smooth talker and I would include myself

37:01

in that just because you like what I have to say doesn't mean you should exempt me from being questioned from

37:10

being challenged you should be curious you should investigate you should put everything to the test as Epictitus said

37:18

find out for yourself do your own research it's why we don't need to be scared about the books you have access

37:25

to and if we do need to be scared if you can't think for yourself if you are

37:30

vulnerable to being brainwashed or hoodwinkedked or manipulated by a book

37:35

in the library what business do you have being in charge of anyone let alone a

37:42

cutting edge fighter jet or an aircraft carrier or a weapon of any kind as I

37:47

said this has to be the work of our life this path to wisdom and education marcus

37:53

Aurelius was seen leaving the palace one day in Rome he's widely beloved and

37:58

respected he's been a philosopher for most of his life and a friend stops him and he says "Sir where are you going?"

38:05

And and Marcus says "I am off to see Sexus the Philosopher to learn that which I do not yet know." The friend was

38:12

amazed he said "Here we have the king of the Romans in his old age taking up his tablets and going to school." It's

## There is no Rank Excluded From Studying

38:18

striking to me that Admiral Stockdale was my age when he entered the halls of Stanford he was in his late 30s he had

38:26

four children he'd spent almost 20 years in the military he'd graduated from an

38:31

elite institution and yet here he was going back to school he must have been

38:36

quite a sight he was confused often on campus for being a professor but no he

38:42

was there to learn as as Epicurus said to to say that the time for learning is passed and gone it's like saying that

38:49

the time for happiness is not yet or that it is now no more no this is the

38:54

season this is the time this is the place whoever you are wherever you are in life it's not just about becoming a

39:01

student but about remaining a student for the rest of your days general Mattis

39:07

would say that there is assigned reading for every rank of marine that even

39:13

generals are assigned new sets of books that they must consume and you think about it as you go through the ranks you

39:19

are exposed to new problems new ideas there are people who have been in your exact shoes who have written about or

39:26

been written about and that experience is there for you you can talk to them you can travel back in time you can

39:32

anticipate the future problems you're going to have he says that at no rank is a marine excused from studying and this

39:40

is true not just for the Marines but for all of us as I conclude here I want to leave you with this idea that at some

39:46

point you will come to a problem or an opportunity or a command at which point

39:53

you will need wisdom you will need something to draw on and it will be too late in that moment to get what you need

40:00

the challenge of an education Stockdale would say later is not to prepare people for success but to prepare them for

40:06

failure and and he said that it's in hardship and failure that the heroes and the bums get sorted out you're going to

40:12

want to draw on this virtue but you can only make that withdrawal if you've been

40:18

making the deposits along the way if you've developed the compass if you have cultivated the base of knowledge and

40:24

experience for Stockdale the the moment the pivotal moment of his life comes in September of

40:30

1965 he's piloting his A4 Skyhawk over North Vietnam when he begins to take

40:36

flack and has to eject and as he is parachuting down into what he knows will

40:42

be certain imprisonment and quite possibly death he says to himself I am leaving the world of technology and

40:49

entering the world of Epictitus in this moment he is thinking of what he had learned at Stanford he is drawing on the

40:56

wisdom that he had been studying not just there in his college days but also in his bunk on the carrier and there he

41:03

was exposed to years of solitary confinement deprivation torture he said

41:10

it was the laboratory of human experience and it was an ordeal that is

41:16

almost incomprehensible and he would say that in these early days as the highest ranking officer

41:22

there he had to put a lot of thought into what his orders should be how he would communicate to the men he was

41:28

charged with leading how they would get through this ordeal he quickly realized that government policy was woefully

41:35

insufficient that it had to be more than name rank serial number and date of birth that they said that had no chance

41:41

of standing up in the torture room that they're under the gun as the masters of their own fate he said we had to throw

41:48

out the book and write our own at Stanford he remembered Professor Rhinelander telling him that a man with

41:56

a proper education should the necessity arise refound their own civilization and

42:01

that is what Stockdale did in the Hanoi Hilton tapping through the walls in

42:07

fertive moments and brief encounters through the letters he wrote home

42:13

through the messages that were passed manto man in the way that they resisted in the example he set he was rewriting

42:20

what it meant to be a prisoner of war rewriting what it meant to resist

42:25

rewriting what it meant to stand on principle he said "There we were

42:31

founding a prison civilization that as a group we had the confidence to disregard bogus orders from home and we had to

42:38

become the center of our own world where we could bring out the best in ourselves as his father had hoped of him as he

42:46

entered the naval academy they had to develop their own laws their own customs even their own heroes." And that is what

## A Proper Education Can Reinvent Civilization

42:52

wisdom is about that is what it was for that is what allowed him to not just survive but as he says famously in the

42:58

Stockdale paradox turn it into an experience that in retrospect not only would he not trade away but that all of

43:04

us his descendants able to talk to him and talk to the dead are better for

43:09

having gone through there in the Hanoi Hilton there subjected to horrendous

43:16

things he was best he was superior to others and certainly he was superior to

43:21

those who tried to break him and that's what wisdom is that's what virtue is

43:26

about that is the message of the talk i wanted to leave you with courage

43:33

discipline justice and wisdom it's been an incredible honor to deliver these first

## Final Remarks

43:40

three lectures to all of you in person i wish I was delivering this fourth lecture under better circumstances my

43:47

intention was not to embarrass anyone my intention was not to cause trouble for

43:53

anyone i just felt like in good conscience I couldn't give a lecture

43:59

about wisdom and not address the fact that a few hundred yards away books are being removed from a library at the

44:06

orders of the secretary of defense i felt that given that I had stood in that

44:13

room and addressed the midshipman on the subject of courage on the subject of

44:20

discipline on the subject of doing the right thing I couldn't then fold just because a pressure was being placed on

44:28

someone who was placing it on someone who was placing it on someone who way down the line is putting that pressure

44:34

on me that felt like a betrayal not just of stoicism the philosophy I have tried

44:40

to apply in my life but also a betrayal of Stockdale in whose name I was giving

44:46

this lecture and whose story I was telling in the talk that I was going to give and look I understand the

44:52

impossible position that the good folks at the Naval Academy have been placed in

44:58

these are not choices they should have to make they should not be having to weigh academic independence and their

45:05

job security or or their pension or negative media attention and angry

45:12

people on the internet they should not be having to be afraid of these things and I understand that I'm in a very

45:19

different position than them and and this is what I said i said "Look I'm a private citizen so not only am I not

45:25

subject to these various constraints I have both a freedom as well as an

45:31

obligation to respond differently than somebody else who has slightly more on the line there have been different times

45:37

in my career where I have been that person on the inside who had to make a choice between staying and going and all

45:45

the rationalizations and the very real trade-offs that go along with that but I'm not at that place in my career

45:51

anymore i'm in a different place i think part of that is a result of what I've

45:57

talked about and been trained in part of it is the privilege and freedom that comes from the success that I've had and

46:04

then also a lot of it comes from my clarity my understanding of having

46:09

studied these things to know where you have to draw the line and so that was a line I felt I needed to draw and

46:16

delivering these lectures has been one of the honors of my life i've just been

46:21

so impressed and inspired by these young men and women who chose a course in life

46:29

very different than the one that I was even contemplating at that age and just to be able to get to talk to them and

46:36

learn from them and to walk the halls where so many great Americans have also walked has been just an incredibly

46:43

moving and transformative experience for me the implication is not just that I

46:49

wouldn't be able to deliver today's talk but my access and my welcome at this institution that I have taken such

46:56

meaning and joy from being a part of and and quite frankly learned so much from

47:03

that that would go away and that's what Stockdale meant when he spoke of extortion environments play along or

47:11

else go along or else now certainly nobody intimated there would be serious

47:16

consequences for me but when they said "Hey you got to delete this if you want to be able to go on stage and and

47:23

speak." I feel very strongly that Stockdale's example tells us why we have

47:28

to say no to things like that our ability to learn from these people who

47:33

went before us to try to make them proud and to try to add our own experience on

47:39

top of theirs that's what the journey to wisdom is about that's what the philosophical life is all about and I

47:45

wish all of you whether you're midshipman whether you're in the armed forces or just uh any person in the

47:51

world trying to live a bit more philosophically I wish you the best in that journey and thanks for listening
