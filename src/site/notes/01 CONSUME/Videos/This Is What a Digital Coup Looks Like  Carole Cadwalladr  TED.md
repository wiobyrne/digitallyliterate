# This Is What a Digital Coup Looks Like  Carole Cadwalladr  TED

![This Is What a Digital Coup Looks Like | Carole Cadwalladr | TED](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZOoT8AbkNE?list=WL)

## Description

“We are watching the collapse of the international order in real time, and this is just the start,” says investigative journalist Carole Cadwalladr. In a searing talk, she decries the rise of the “broligarchy” — the powerful tech executives who are using their global digital platforms to amass unprecedented geopolitical power, dismantling democracy and enabling authoritarian control across the world. Her rallying cry: resist data harvesting and mass surveillance, and support others in a groundswell of digital disobedience. “You have more power than you think,” she says. (Recorded at TED2025 on April 8, 2025)

## Notes

## Transcript

0:04

I've been feeling a lot of panic and fear about this talk.

0:11

And not just for the normal reasons of public speaking,

0:14

although that's there, too.

0:16

But it's also because I want to say something meaningful,

0:21

and I've been overwhelmed by the enormity

0:24

of what is happening right now.

0:27

And there's a particular set of circumstances

0:30

which have also been feeding into my confusion and denial.

0:36

And that is because the last time that I stood on this stage,

0:41

it led to a three-year legal battle,

0:45

culminated in London's High Court,

0:49

in which it felt like I was on trial for my life,

0:52

because I was.

0:54

My career, my reputation, my finances,

0:57

even my home was on the line.

1:01

All because I came here

1:04

to warn you

1:05

that I didn't think democracy was going to survive the technology

1:10

that you're building,

1:11

however incredible it is.

1:13

In fact, I was the person who almost didn't survive,

1:17

and pretty much everything I was warning about is now coming true.

1:24

I can't sugarcoat it.

1:26

It's a bit of a headfuck.

1:27

(Laughter)

1:30

I have a lot of emotions about coming here.

1:33

And TED, also, I suspect, is feeling them too.

1:38

But what actually I finally realized yesterday

1:41

is that the denial and the confusion that I've been feeling

1:44

is maybe what you're feeling, too.

1:48

I felt powerless for a really long time.

1:51

So if that's what you're feeling, I get it.

1:55

But we have to act now.

1:59

My alarm system is ringing again.

2:05

There are things that we can do.

2:08

In my case, I survived.

2:11

And you will too.

2:12

But it's by learning how to fight back.

2:16

This is my guide,

2:18

and it has to start with naming it.

2:24

It's a coup.

2:26

I know you probably don't want to hear that, and especially here,

2:29

but we can’t fight it if we can’t see it.

2:31

And we can’t see it if we don’t name it.

2:34

(Applause)

2:41

The Russian and American presidents are now speaking the same words.

2:46

They are telling the same lies.

2:49

We are watching the collapse of the international order in real time.

2:55

And this is just the start.

2:58

Coups are like concrete.

3:00

When they stop moving, they set.

3:03

It is already later than we think.

3:07

This image, some of you in this room might know these people.

3:10

I call it tech bros in hostage situations.

3:13

It's a message to you.

3:15

This is Putin's playbook.

3:19

He allows a business elite to make untold riches

3:22

in exchange for absolute loyalty.

3:26

Some people are calling this oligarchy,

3:29

but it's actually bigger than that.

3:32

These are global platforms.

3:36

It's broligarchy.

3:38

\[Tech bros + oligarchy = broligarchy\]

3:40

(Laughter and murmuring)

3:42

(Applause)

3:48

There is an alignment of interests

3:52

that runs through Silicon Valley

3:55

to what is now a coming autocracy.

4:01

It's a type of power that the world has never seen before.

4:07

\[Follow the data\]

4:09

It's always the data.

4:12

It's the crack cocaine of Silicon Valley.

4:15

You know, the first thing that Elon Musk did

4:18

was to send his cyber troops into the US Treasury

4:21

to get access to the data.

4:23

That is not a coincidence.

4:24

It's a hack.

4:26

That data is now feeding AIs that are choosing who to sack

4:30

and who to replace --

4:31

Sorry -- eliminate fraud and waste.

4:34

(Laughter)

4:36

When we broke the Cambridge Analytica story

4:39

about the harvesting \[of\] 87 million people’s Facebook data,

4:43

people freaked out, rightly.

4:46

\[That\] is chicken feed compared to \[this\].

4:50

But it is the blueprint.

4:53

It's always the data.

4:56

Which is why it's so important

4:58

that you start thinking about your private life.

5:01

The broligarchy doesn't want you to have one.

5:03

This is the old headquarters of the East German secret police.

5:09

They kept detailed files on almost one in three of their citizens.

5:15

That is nothing compared to what Google has

5:19

on every single one of us,

5:21

and hundreds of other companies.

5:25

The entire business model of Silicon Valley is surveillance.

5:30

It harvests our data in order to sell us stuff.

5:35

We are already living inside the architecture of totalitarianism.

5:40

(Cheers)

5:42

(Applause)

5:44

It may not have been deliberate,

5:48

but we now have to start acting as if we live in East Germany,

5:53

and Instagram is the Stasi.

5:58

Politics is downstream from culture.

6:01

So I actually learned this from somebody

6:05

who I think of as one of the great philosophers of our age,

6:09

Steve Bannon.

6:10

(Laughter)

6:11

He actually stole it from somebody else.

6:15

But it's not politicians who have the power.

6:20

He knows that.

6:21

It's why he's a podcast bro, these days.

6:25

But culture now is just what's next on your phone.

6:30

And that's AI.

6:32

Culture is AI now.

6:35

And forget the killer robots.

6:37

If you want to know what the first great AI apocalypse is,

6:42

we're already living it.

6:44

It's total information collapse.

6:48

And if you take one thing only away from this talk,

6:53

it's politics is technology now.

6:57

And that's why everybody in this room, you can't look away.

7:01

It's why your CEOs have been taken captive

7:04

and are paraded on TV like hostages.

7:08

But you, you have a choice.

7:13

So Trump, he calls the press the enemies of the people.

7:17

And he probably doesn't even know that he's quoting Stalin.

7:22

So what happened to me is a playbook,

7:25

and it's now coming for all sorts of other people.

7:30

It was actually a friend of this guy who came after me.

7:34

This is Nigel Farage.

7:35

He's a Brexit funder.

7:36

I'm not going to go super into the details.

7:42

But 19 press-freedom organizations

7:47

called the lawsuit against me a SLAPP.

7:50

That means it’s a Strategic Litigation Against Public Participation.

7:56

A really long-winded way of saying

7:58

it's using law as a weapon to shut people up.

8:01

Not just journalists, but other public people, too.

8:03

And it works.

8:06

I just wanted to tell you about one aspect of the litigation,

8:09

which I found terrifying.

8:11

And that was the data harvesting.

8:14

There's this quote you may know, it's Cardinal Richelieu,

8:17

"If you give me six lines

8:19

written by the hand of the most honest of men,

8:22

I will find something in them which will hang him."

8:26

In my case,

8:28

the first forensic searches of my phone and laptop

8:31

yielded 40,000 pieces of data.

8:35

It was my messages, my emails,

8:38

my voice memos, my personal life.

8:42

And the whole thing about this,

8:45

the attack which came for me, was really personal.

8:48

Because the thing about this litigation is only one part of the playbook.

8:53

It was also this sort of massive online campaign of abuse,

8:58

which is just day after day,

9:02

after day, after day.

9:04

Because my most unforgivable crime was reporting while female.

9:11

It was a digital witch burning.

9:16

And I believe that this man came after me personally,

9:20

not at "The Guardian" and not TED,

9:22

it was because I looked like the weakest link.

9:26

But he was wrong.

9:29

(Cheers and applause)

9:37

30,000 people rose up to support me.

9:41

They contributed almost a million pounds to a legal defense fund.

9:46

Because they saw a bully trying to crush me,

9:49

and they would not let it stand.

9:53

And it always makes me emotional when I think about that.

9:57

I just heard somebody was saying, the camera person,

9:59

I don't know where they are, contributed.

10:05

This whole talk is actually my gratitude towards everybody who did that.

10:11

But it's also why I know about what we have to do next.

10:15

You know, Trump is suing news organizations,

10:17

and every day they're settling.

10:19

These are big corporates with corporate interests.

10:22

Not everybody can stand up to power,

10:24

but there are people who are doing it, and we can support them.

10:29

We have to have each other’s backs right now.

10:32

Because we are the cavalry now.

10:35

You know, this is really important to me,

10:37

but I spoke to a UK libel lawyer before this talk.

10:42

I want to say that there is an awful lot of facts set down

10:46

in a High Court judgment,

10:49

and we're actually taking the case now to the European Court of Human Rights.

10:53

We're testing the UK on its laws around freedom of expression.

10:59

So look after facts.

11:00

You'll miss them when they've gone.

11:02

This is Wayback Machine.

11:03

Give them money,

11:04

they're trying to preserve the internet as it's being deleted day by day.

11:08

(Applause)

11:12

History is our best chance of getting out of this.

11:16

You know, you probably know this phrase,

11:18

"Do not obey in advance."

11:20

That's Tim Snyder, who's a historian of authoritarianism.

11:23

We now are in techno-authoritarianism.

11:26

We have to learn how to digitally disobey.

11:29

That can be as simple as the dropdown box.

11:32

Don't accept the cookies,

11:34

don't give your real name,

11:36

download Signal, the encrypted messaging app.

11:39

Don’t bomb Yemen,

11:40

don't add the editor of "The Atlantic" to your group chats.

11:44

(Laughter)

11:49

Don't experiment on children.

11:52

You know, social mores change.

11:53

We don't send children down coal mines anymore.

11:56

And in years to come,

11:58

allowing your child to be data-harvested from birth

12:02

will be considered child abuse.

12:05

You didn't know, but now you do.

12:09

Privacy is power.

12:14

And we have more of it than we think.

12:17

I had this little epiphany yesterday in which I realized, actually,

12:20

the moments when I felt most powerless

12:23

were the moments that I felt I was actually most powerful.

12:27

It was because my journalism had impact.

12:31

They want us to feel powerless.

12:32

That's the plan.

12:34

There is so much, though,

12:35

that we can learn from people who've been through this before.

12:39

Alexei Navalny,

12:40

the leader of the Russian opposition,

12:42

he always talked about a beautiful Russia of the future.

12:46

He painted a vision.

12:48

There is a beautiful internet of the future,

12:53

free from corporate capture and data tracking.

12:57

We can build it.

12:59

It is going to take a movement.

13:02

But we can learn from movements that there have been before us.

13:07

This is my colleagues and I on strike in December

13:11

because my news organization, "The Guardian,"

13:14

decided to sell our corner of it, “The Observer,” the Sunday title.

13:20

And it was a battle we really didn’t need at this time,

13:23

and we didn’t actually win,

13:25

but you know, you can’t win every battle.

13:30

But you definitely won’t win if you don’t fight.

13:33

(Applause)

13:38

So I want to leave you with this.

13:42

This is ChatGPT

13:45

writing a TED Talk in the style of Carole Cadwalladr.

13:51

And it is creepily plausible.

13:55

But what it doesn't know,

13:56

because AI is actually as dumb as a rock,

14:00

is that I am going to turn to Sam Altman,

14:03

who is coming here, a TED speaker,

14:06

and say that this does not belong to you.

14:11

ChatGPT has been trained on my IP,

14:15

my labor, my personal data.

14:18

(Applause and cheers)

14:24

And I did not consent.

14:28

You know, "The Guardian" has effectively got rid

14:31

of more than 100 journalists.

14:33

We actually leave the building next week.

14:37

And shortly afterwards,

14:38

it signed a syndication deal with OpenAI.

14:43

Or, as I think of it,

14:45

it married its rapist.

14:49

But I do not consent.

14:52

And while we still have copyright laws in my country,

14:55

UK government is trying to tear them up at the moment

14:58

in order to suck up to Silicon Valley and Trump.

15:01

But while we have them, use them.

15:04

Because what is happening to my industry

15:07

is happening to yours, too.

15:09

And it's more than theft.

15:11

It's a violation.

15:13

Data rights are human rights.

15:18

(Applause)

15:23

In 2019,

15:25

I came here, and I called out the gods of Silicon Valley.

15:31

I was wrong.

15:34

Sam Altman, Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk,

15:39

you are not gods.

15:41

You are men, and you are careless.

15:45

(Applause and cheers)

15:53

You think that by allying yourself with an autocrat

15:57

you will be protected.

15:59

That's not how history works.

16:01

It's not even how oligarchy works.

16:04

This is Mikhail Khodorkovsky.

16:06

He was an oligarch until he was sent to Siberia,

16:10

to prison for 10 years,

16:12

after Putin tired of him.

16:15

You are sucking up to a tyrant ...

16:20

who is trying to destroy the laws

16:22

who made your businesses possible.

16:26

You are collaborators.

16:29

You are complicit in a regime of fear and cruelty.

16:36

But the rest of us,

16:38

we all here, we have a choice.

16:43

I chose to come back to TED

16:47

because I'm reclaiming my story, my words.

16:52

(Cheers and applause)

17:03

We are not powerless.

17:07

The 30,000 people who supported me

17:11

proved that -- we are not powerless.

17:15

Because we know who we are, and we know what we stand for.

17:20

And my question to Silicon Valley is,

17:23

do you?

17:26

Thank you.

17:28

(Cheers and applause)
