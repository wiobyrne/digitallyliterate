# It's time to start backing up the web. - YouTube

![It's time to start backing up the web. - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGuXTFyxLe0)

## Description

It's more important than ever to contribute to information preservation projects and start backing up the web. Open information is crucial to a thriving society, and political forces are currently working hard to restrict your access (and the access of government agencies) to all sorts of important information in the name of "combatting wokeness." Here's 3 ways you can help.

## Notes

## Transcript

## Data is being taken away, it's time to ACT

0:00

I'm not a prepper I don't want an

0:01

underground fallout shelter I don't want

0:03

to hoard military rations and toilet

0:05

paper but I do want to preserve protect

0:07

and share open information open

0:09

information has been at the core of my

0:11

entire career from sharing academic

0:13

articles my various ongoing projects to

0:15

keep stuff alive on internet archive to

0:17

my original start teaching video

0:19

broadcast and streaming when things were

0:21

hidden behind gatekeep doors I've lost

0:23

enough data on my own and seen too many

0:25

websites and forums disappear to trust

0:27

the old saying that the internet never

0:29

forgets anymore betrayed by the myth

0:31

that something uploaded to the internet

0:33

can never be taken away I've seen others

0:35

beg for backups of their favorite online

0:37

game people come together to keep a

0:38

website alive just long enough to

0:40

generate an archive of it and I've seen

0:42

the devastation that a free photo

0:44

hosting site nuking all of their photos

0:45

can have on forums and websites

0:47

everywhere most recently the data

0:49

hoarding And archiving scenes have had

0:50

to rush to try to mirror thousands of

0:52

data sets research pages and websites

0:55

from the general government websites and

0:57

the department of energy NASA and most

0:59

wickedly the C DC as the current

1:01

Administration is set on destroying

1:03

science that is inconvenient to Target

1:05

the wokies rather than lowering the cost

1:07

of eggs our housing or any of the

1:09

countless groceries and building

1:10

materials we import from our neighbors

1:12

and now the unelected Broar who's in the

1:14

midst of a coup of the US Treasury has

1:16

started targeting Wikipedia Humanity's

1:18

open encyclopedia and home base of

1:20

knowledge calling to defund it and

1:22

replace it with AI chat Bots that he

1:23

controls Wikipedia's article acceptance

1:25

and revision moderation is not perfect

1:27

and skews a little too heavily towards

1:29

one gender but is not political and AI

1:32

llms are too prone to hallucination and

1:34

literally being able to be controlled to

1:36

Output overwritten information to be

1:38

trusted especially when provided by

1:40

someone with blatant and transparent

1:41

conflicts of interest so it's time to

1:44

start making backups while there are a

1:45

few headline garnering projects of

1:47

people making cyber decks and pelican

1:49

cases to put in their bunkers I'm not

1:51

too worried about that if someone

1:52

succeeds in taking down a big source of

1:54

information your personal offline

1:55

archive may be useful for you but won't

1:57

help the masses online what we can do

2:00

however is strand the hell out of it and

2:02

pop up enough clones everywhere that

2:04

enough normal people know to just search

2:05

for new Wikipedia and get access to it

2:08

it's happened before for this we're

2:10

looking at kiwix an open- Source offline

## Back Up Wikipedia (& others) w/ Kiwix

2:12

web browser created way back in 2007

2:15

this browser is critical in spreading

2:17

information including being used in

2:18

information smuggling operations in

2:20

North Korea kiwix works by packaging up

2:23

information websites such as Wikipedia

2:25

stack exchange TED talks and other

2:27

Wikipedia sites into Zim files and then

2:29

reading them back as if they're just a

2:31

pre-built offline document the program

2:33

is free and available for everything you

2:35

can get it on Windows Mac Linux Android

2:38

iOS Raspberry Pi browser extensions are

2:40

available and you can get server images

2:42

to host it you can build just about

2:43

anything with the data from this install

2:45

the program and from there you can

2:47

browse archive sites of all kinds for

2:48

Wikipedia specifically it's divided up

2:50

based on category top 100 and top 1,000

2:53

article lists and so on personally I

2:55

think it's a little too filtering to

2:56

just download the top any number of

2:58

Articles using a social filter like that

3:00

doesn't really help the preservation CA

3:02

thankfully as of the last updated

3:04

archive Wikipedia itself has only about

3:06

110 GB to download in an its entirety or

3:09

only about 58 GB if you don't want

3:11

photos and videos for some reason that

3:13

means it's pretty tiny All Things

3:14

Considered to package up on a Micro SD

3:16

card for a Raspberry Pi Project to keep

3:18

in your bunker if you're that kind of

3:20

person or just keep on your computer or

3:22

Nas or pass along to friends a ton of

3:24

sites and educational content have been

3:26

added to kiwix since its release I know

3:28

I'm saying this wrong kiwix X It wiki ex

3:31

I I've never heard it said out loud so

3:33

I'm just making it up as I go I do this

3:35

a lot anyway a ton of sites have been

3:37

added to it since its release including

3:40

Linux wikis chemistry and Engineering

3:41

texts music guidance research in various

3:44

sciences and maths tons of documentation

3:46

for programming programming languages or

3:48

other it topics photography cooking

3:50

history and so on you can pick and

3:52

choose what you want to download and

3:53

archive and update through the app

3:55

anything you save can be viewed online

3:57

or offline making it great for building

3:58

your own offline encyclopedia free of

4:01

ads or other intrusions I'd love for

4:03

there to be a more straightforward

4:04

process to package up any arbitrary site

4:06

to include in these archives as we could

4:08

really start preserving the net even

4:09

more but as it is the best way for us to

4:11

combat Mass deletion and information

4:13

censorship is to keep backups with kiwix

## Back up the Web w/ Internet Archive browser Extension

4:15

and support other archiving Endeavors as

4:17

an example you can install the internet

4:19

archive browser extension and set it up

4:21

to automatically archive any public

4:23

website you visit it won't like save

4:24

your emails or anything don't worry but

4:26

save those to the way back machine if it

4:28

hasn't been archived in the past last

4:29

week or month or year that way your

4:31

normal web use contributes to keeping a

4:33

backup of the web

## Help capture deleted webpages w/ ArchiveTeam Warrior

4:35

too the last method I wanted to

4:37

highlight comes from archive team.org

4:39

they've released a distributed computing

4:41

tool similar to folding at home if you

4:43

remember those days of teams competing

4:44

to fold proteins and running PS3s all

4:46

night to contribute to science or you

4:48

can run a virtual box Appliance to

4:49

contribute to Archive teams efforts to

4:51

Archive government Pages before they get

4:53

delet it there is a lot of demanding

4:55

work and splitting it up among as many

4:57

computers as possible helps speed things

4:58

up and sure as much is protected as

5:01

possible install virtual box if you

5:03

haven't already then download the

5:04

archive team Warrior Appliance from the

5:06

link in the description import the

5:08

appliance and virtual box use the

5:09

default settings and then start it if

5:11

you get an error reboot your PC and try

5:12

again worked for me every time go to The

5:14

Address given in the popup once it's

5:16

ready it's just Local Host Port 80001

5:19

here you can assign a nickname to your

5:20

tracking here and then choose a project

5:23

the government project is the priority

5:24

one at the moment but there are a lot

5:25

you can do here and then click on

5:27

current progress to see how you're doing

5:29

and you should see that a bunch of

5:30

illegible log messages are just

5:31

scrolling by if it's working great I

5:33

know they've had some kind of it's

5:36

gotten really popular in the past few

5:37

weeks so they've had issues Distributing

5:39

the load to everyone but there are other

5:40

projects on the warrior app that you

5:42

could support if the government one

5:44

isn't working out in this moment I'll

5:46

have links to more information on this

5:47

project and the leader board in the

5:48

description below I plan on contributing

5:50

to this project a ton I've had it

5:51

running on like three machines already

5:53

public record is a crucial part of

5:55

preserving history and those who seek to

5:56

destroy it and manipulate history will

5:58

never work to serve your your best

5:59

interest taking small steps to ensure

6:01

information is never lost and if

6:03

anything spreads more widely benefits

6:05

all of humanity regardless of which

6:07

political affiliation you might believe

6:09

yourself to have what other ways do you

6:11

think we could preserve information

6:12

research and history comment below and

6:14

remember to Be Kind Rewind
