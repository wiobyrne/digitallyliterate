# The Self-Improvement Lie - YouTube

![The Self-Improvement Lie - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TANEzcjNDvc)

## Description

The obsession with self-improvement isn’t just a personal journey — it’s a consequence of the economic system we live under: Neoliberalism. 

From hustle culture to self-help podcasts — I break down how market-fundamentalist thinking has infiltrated not only our institutions, but our minds. This mindset shift hasn’t just shaped our economy and our sense of self — it has helped today’s billionaires build their empires, while the rest of us compete just to keep up. Along the way, I’ll introduce key figures behind this ideology, like Margaret Thatcher, Ronald Reagan, and economist Milton Friedman.
