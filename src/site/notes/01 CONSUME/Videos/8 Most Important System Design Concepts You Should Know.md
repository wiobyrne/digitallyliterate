Building scalable systems isn't just about writing good code - it's about

0:05

anticipating and solving problems before they become critical.

0:09

Today, we'll explore eight system design challenges that every growing system faces,

0:14

along with the solutions that top companies use to tackle them.

0:18

Every successful application eventually faces the challenge of handling high read volumes.

0:23

Imagine a popular news website where millions of readers view articles,

0:28

but only a small team of editors publishes new content.

0:31

The mismatch between reads and writes creates an interesting scaling problem.

0:36

The solution is caching.

0:38

By implementing a fast cache layer,

0:40

the system first checks for data there before hitting the slower database.

0:44

While this dramatically reduces database load, caching has its challenges:

0:48

keeping the cache in sync with the database and managing cache expiration.

0:53

Strategies like TTL on keys or write-through caching can help maintain consistency.

0:58

Tools like Redis or Memcached make implementing this pattern easier.

1:02

Caching is especially effective for read-heavy,

1:05

low-churn data, like static pages or product listings.

1:09

Some systems face the opposite challenge - handling massive amounts of incoming writes.

1:14

Consider a logging system processing millions of events per second,

1:18

or a social media platform managing real-time user

1:21

interactions. These systems need different optimization strategies.

1:26

We tackle this with two approaches. First,

1:28

asynchronous writes with message queues and worker processes.

1:33

Instead of processing writes immediately, the system queues them for background handling.

1:38

This gives users instant feedback while the heavy processing happens in the background.

1:43

Second, we use LSM-Tree based databases like Cassandra.

1:47

These databases collect writes in memory and periodically flush them to disk as sorted files.

1:53

To maintain performance, they perform compaction:

1:56

merging files to reduce the number of lookups required during reads.

2:00

This makes writes very fast

2:02

but reads become slower as they may need to check multiple files.

2:06

Handling high write loads is just one part of the puzzle.

2:09

Even the fastest system becomes useless if it goes down.

2:13

An e-commerce platform with a single database

2:15

server stops entirely on failure - no searches, no purchases, no revenue.

2:21

We solve this through redundancy and failover,

2:24

implementing database replication with primary and replica instances.

2:28

While this increases availability, it introduces complexity in consistency management. We might

2:34

choose synchronous replication to prevent data loss and accept higher latency,

2:38

or opt for asynchronous replication that offers better performance but

2:42

risks slight data loss during failures.

2:45

Some systems even use quorum-based replication to balance consistency and availability.

2:51

Critical services like payment systems need true

2:53

high availability. This requires both load balancing and replication working together.

2:58

Load balancers distribute traffic across server clusters and reroute around failures.

3:03

For databases, a primary-replica setup is standard:

3:07

the primary handles writes

3:09

while multiple replicas handle reads,

3:11

and failover ensures a replica can take over if the primary fails.

3:15

Multiple-primary replication is another option for distributing

3:18

writes geographically, though it comes with more complex consistency trade-offs.

3:24

Performance becomes even more critical when serving users globally.

3:28

Users in Australia shouldn't wait for content to load from servers in Europe.

3:32

CDNs solve this by caching content closer to users, dramatically reducing latency.

3:38

Static content, like videos and images, works perfectly with CDNs.

3:42

For dynamic content, solutions like edge computing can complement CDN caching.

3:48

Different types of content need different cache-control

3:50

headers - longer durations for media files,

3:53

shorter for user profiles.

3:56

Managing large amounts of data brings its own challenges.

3:59

Modern platforms use two types of storage: block storage and object storage.

4:04

Block storage with its low latency and high

4:06

IOPS is ideal for databases and frequently accessed small files.

4:11

Object storage on the other hand costs less and is designed to handle large,

4:15

static files like videos and backups at scale.

4:19

Most platforms combine these: user data goes into block storage,

4:22

while media files are stored in object storage.

4:26

With all these systems running, we need to monitor their performance.

4:30

Modern monitoring tools like Prometheus collect logs and metrics,

4:33

while Grafana provides visualization.

4:37

Distributed tracing tools like OpenTelemetry help debug performance bottlenecks across components.

4:43

At scale, managing this flood of data is challenging. The key is to sample routine events,

4:49

keep detailed logs for critical operations, and set up alerts that trigger only for real problems.

4:55

One of the most common issues monitoring reveals is slow database queries.

5:00

Indexing is the first line of defense.

5:03

Without indexes, the database scans every record to find what it needs.

5:08

With indexes, it can quickly jump to the right data.

5:11

Composite indexes, for multi-column queries, can further optimize performance.

5:17

But every index slows down writes slightly since they need to be updated as data changes.

5:22

Sometimes indexing alone isn't enough.

5:24

As a last resort, consider sharding - splitting the database across multiple machines,

5:30

using strategies like range-based or hash-based distribution.

5:34

While sharding can scale the system significantly,

5:37

it adds substantial complexity and can be challenging to reverse.

Tools like Vitess simplify sharding for databases like MySQL,

6:04

but itâ€™s a strategy to use sparingly and only when absolutely necessary.
