## Extended Summary
In "Bad Samaritans," Ha-Joon Chang critiques the one-size-fits-all approach advocated by many developed nations and international institutions when it comes to economic policies for developing countries. He argues that historical context, political factors, and institutional capacity must be taken into account when designing economic strategies.

The book explores how globalization has both benefits and drawbacks for developing nations, emphasizing the need for strategic industrial policies to foster growth and innovation. Chang highlights the importance of learning from successful models of economic development rather than blindly following Western prescriptions. Through a mix of theoretical analysis and empirical evidence, he presents a compelling case for a more balanced approach to economic policymaking that prioritizes national interests and long-term sustainability.
