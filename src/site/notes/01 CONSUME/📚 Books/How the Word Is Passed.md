## Extended Summary
"How the Word Is Passed" is an enlightening account of America's relationship with its history of slavery. The book examines this complex issue through the lens of several key historic sites - Monticello plantation, Angola Prison, Blandford Cemetery for Confederate Soldiers, the Whitney Plantation Museum in Louisiana and New York’s Wall Street among others.

Clint Smith delves into a critical analysis of how these locations interpret and present their ties to slavery. He uncovers stories that reveal a pattern of selective memory and purposeful forgetfulness that often typifies mainstream narratives about America's racial past.

At Monticello, for instance, Smith highlights how Thomas Jefferson's life as a slave owner is often overshadowed by his role as a founding father. At Angola Prison in Louisiana - once a slave plantation and now one of the largest maximum-security prisons in the U.S - he draws chilling parallels between historical enslavement and contemporary mass incarceration.

Smith skillfully weaves together history, reportage, personal narrative and critical analysis to challenge long-held myths about American history. His insightful exploration reveals many uncomfortable truths - that America's past is deeply intertwined with slavery, and its legacies continue to shape the present.
