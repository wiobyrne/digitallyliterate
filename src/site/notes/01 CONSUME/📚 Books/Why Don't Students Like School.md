## Three-Sentence Summary
- "Why Don't Students Like School" explores the psychology behind why students struggle with enjoying school and proposes solutions for making education more engaging and effective.
- Drawing on cognitive science, Daniel T. Willingham explains that the human brain is not designed for thinking but for solving problems related to survival, which forms a significant part of the disinterest students often display in academic learning.
- The book presents nine principles based on this understanding, providing teachers and school administrators with practical strategies to create a learning environment that stimulates curiosity, fosters comprehension, and encourages a love for learning.

## Extended Summary
In "Why Don't Students Like School," cognitive scientist Daniel T. Willingham delves into the intricacies of how the human brain works to explain why many students find school uninteresting or even tedious. He presents an argument grounded in scientific research: our minds are not naturally inclined towards thinking - they are primarily designed to save us from having to think. In essence, our brains have evolved to solve problems directly linked to survival rather than engage in abstract thought or memorization of facts.

The book breaks down this overarching theme into nine principles that educators can use as a guide in their teaching practices. These principles include understanding that people are naturally curious but not naturally good thinkers; memory is the residue of thought; deep knowledge must precede deep thinking; proficiency requires practice; and children are more alike than different in terms of learning.

Willingham supports these principles with real-life classroom examples, demonstrating how they can be applied practically. He also addresses common myths about how people learn and provides insights on how educators can foster an environment where students enjoy learning.

One key takeaway from the book is that educators should focus less on rote memorization and more on encouraging critical thinking skills through problem-solving tasks that resonate with real-life situations. This approach has the potential to make school more exciting and meaningful for students, contributing to an increased love for learning.

## Key Points
1. The human brain is not naturally inclined towards abstract thinking or memorization; it's designed to solve survival-related problems.
2. Engaging education should encourage critical thinking through problem-solving tasks that resonate with real-life situations rather than focusing on rote memorization.
3. Willingham presents nine principles rooted in cognitive science that educators can apply to make learning more enjoyable and effective.

## Who Should Read
Teachers, school administrators, parents, and anyone interested in education would find this book valuable. It provides insights into how the human brain works and how these processes impact learning, offering practical strategies for making education more engaging and effective.

## Readwise Highlights

- So far I’ve described two ways in which your brain is set up to save you from having to think. First, some of the most important functions (for example, vision and movement) don’t require thought: you don’t have to reason about what you see; you just immediately know what’s out in the world. Second, you are biased to use memory to guide your actions rather than to think. But your brain doesn’t leave it there; it is capable of changing in order to save you from having to think. If you repeat the same thought-demanding task again and again, it will eventually become automatic; your brain will change so that you can complete the task without thinking about it.

- The implications for education sound rather grim. If people are bad at thinking and try to avoid it, what does that say about students’ attitudes toward school? Fortunately, the story doesn’t end with people stubbornly refusing to think. Despite the fact that we’re not that good at it, we actually like to think.We are naturally curious, and we look for opportunities to engage in certain types of thought. But because thinking is so hard, the conditions have to be right for this curiosity to thrive, or we quit thinking rather readily.The next section explains when we like to think and when we don’t.

- To summarize, I’ve said that thinking is slow, effortful, and uncertain.

- Let me summarize what I’ve said in this chapter. People’s minds are not especially well-suited to thinking; thinking is slow, effortful, and uncertain. For this reason, deliberate thinking does not guide people’s behavior in most situations. Rather, we rely on our memories, following courses of action that we have taken before. Nevertheless, we find successful thinking pleasurable.We like solving problems, understanding new ideas, and so forth. Thus, we will seek out opportunities to think, but we are selective in doing so; we choose problems that pose some challenge but that seem likely to be solvable, because these are the problems that lead to feelings of pleasure and satisfaction. For problems to be solved, the thinker needs adequate information from the environment, room in working memory, and the required facts and procedures in long-term memory.

- The answer is that they understand new ideas (things they don’t know) by relating them to old ideas (things they do know). That sounds fairly straightforward.

So for example, if asked,“How is government different from our school?” the student would be stumped. A student with deep knowledge would be able to answer that question, and might successfully extend the analogy to consider other groups of people who might need to form rules, for example, his group of friends playing pickup basketball.

- There are, however, ways to cheat this limitation. In Chapter Two I discussed at length how to keep more information in working memory by compressing the information. In a process called chunking, you treat several separate things as a single unit. Instead of maintaining the letters c, o, g, n, i, t, i, o, and n in working memory, you chunk them into a single unit, the word cognition. A whole word takes up about the same amount of room in working memory that a single letter does. But chunking letters into a word requires that you know the word. If the letters were p, a, z, z, e, s, c, and o, you could chunk them effectively if you happened to know that pazzesco is an Italian word meaning “crazy.” But if you didn’t have the word in your long-term memory, you could not chunk the letters. [Location 1849](https://readwise.io/open/205792628)

- Thus, the first way to cheat the limited size of your working memory is through factual knowledge.There is a second way: you can make the processes that manipulate information in working memory more efficient. In fact, you can make them so efficient that they are virtually cost free.Think about learning to tie your shoes.   Initially it requires your full attention and thus absorbs all of working memory, but with practice you can tie your shoes automatically (Figure 2 [Location 1856](https://readwise.io/open/205792629)

- Mental processes can become automatized. Automatic processes require little or no working memory capacity.They also tend to be quite rapid in that you seem to know just what to do without even making a conscious decision to do it.

- Finding a fact in long-term memory and putting it into working memory places almost no demands on working memory.
