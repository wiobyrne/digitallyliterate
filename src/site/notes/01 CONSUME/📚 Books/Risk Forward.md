- The Prism Effect
  When we don't see a reflection in the outside world of what we find within ourselves, the temptation is to hide parts of who we really are in order to fit into a mold.
  But if you think of the metaphor of light shining through a prism, the prism reveals that white light is actually comprised of a full range of colors fused together.
  If you remove one of the colors, the light dims.
  The same is true for you. [None](https://readwise.io/open/206691602)

- "Any creative endeavor is a discovery. You start out with a gut sense that something feels worthwhile only to realize it's shallow and stale. Then you're lost for a while, not sure where to turn. Only by wrestling through countless rewrites and late nights of self-doubt do you find something new. You can't make a new discovery by following a preprinted map."

- DON'T OUTSOURCE YOUR VISION 
  When a vision is not yet clear, and when we're hesitant to Risk Forward, it's tempting to hand over the reins.
  We want someone else to make the decisions. We want them to tell us what to do.
  We assume that because we're not yet clear, we never will be.
  Clarity is a process.
  And sometimes the project, plan, or path tells you what it wants to be and at that point, it takes on a life of its own, and it guides you. [None](https://readwise.io/open/206691707)

- MAKE YOUR OWN MISTAKES 
  "I would rather follow my instincts and make a mistake than follow someone else's instincts and make a mistake. If you follow someone else's instincts and fail, you've failed and it's not even your own. At the end of the day, you want ownership even over your mistakes. And for that matter, l'll go even further. I'd rather follow my own instincts and fail than follow someone else's instincts and succeed." -Frank Oz 
  Risking forward requires being willing to make mistakes. [None](https://readwise.io/open/206691753)
