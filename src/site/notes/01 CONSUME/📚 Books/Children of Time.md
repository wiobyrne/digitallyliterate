## Three-Sentence Summary
In "Children of Time," a last-ditch effort to terraform a planet results in the unexpected evolution of spiders into an intelligent species. The narrative alternates between the perspective of these spiders and the last humans who, in a desperate search for a new home, encounter this alien society. The novel explores themes around humanity's struggle for survival, sentient evolution, and the potential consequences of playing god.

## Extended Summary
"Children of Time" is an epic sci-fi novel that centers on two primary narratives: one following a race of sentient spiders evolving on a terraformed planet, and another tracking the last remnants of humanity searching for a new home. 

The story begins with Dr. Avrana Kern attempting to execute her ambitious plan to terraform a planet and seed it with monkeys infected with nanovirus that would speed up their evolution into intelligent beings. However, things go awry due to sabotage, leaving only the nanovirus and spiders to evolve over millennia.

On Earth, humanity has suffered ecological collapse and wars over remaining resources. With Earth dying, they embark on an ambitious journey aboard the starship Gilgamesh to find Avrana's planet in hopes it will be their salvation.

Over hundreds of generations, Kern watches as her accidental experiment unfolds: spiders become sentient beings with their own complex society and technology. When humans finally arrive after their long journey through cryosleep, they encounter these evolved creatures.

The narrative structure alternates between these two perspectives - from human characters aboard Gilgamesh struggling with societal decay and desperation to survive; and spider characters grappling with technological advancements while trying to understand Kern, who they believe is an omnipotent god.

Ultimately "Children of Time" paints a vivid picture of possible sentient evolution and the perils of playing god. It also explores the idea of what makes one human and challenges conventional notions of intelligence and progress.

## Key Points
1. The novel presents a fascinating exploration of sentient evolution outside human parameters, showcasing the development of a complex spider society.
2. The narrative contrasts the survival instincts and societal dynamics between humans and the evolved spiders, providing an interesting perspective on intelligence and civilization.
3. Through Kern's character, Tchaikovsky critiques the potential consequences of unchecked ambition and playing god.

## Who Should Read
"Children of Time" is ideal for science fiction lovers who enjoy deep world-building, complex narratives, and explorations into themes such as evolution, survival, civilization, and human nature. It would also be intriguing for those interested in speculative fiction that challenges conventional perspectives on intelligence and progress.
