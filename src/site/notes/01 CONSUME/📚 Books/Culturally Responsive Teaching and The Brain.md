## Extended Summary
"Culturally Responsive Teaching and The Brain" is an insightful book that provides a framework for creating effective learning environments for diverse students. It combines research from neuroscience, psychology, and education to show how culturally responsive teaching can improve student engagement and academic outcomes.

Hammond starts by defining culturally responsive teaching as a pedagogical approach that acknowledges the importance of including students' cultural references in all aspects of learning. She explains that this approach is necessary because it recognizes and respects the unique experiences of ethnically diverse students.

Hammond then delves into cognitive neuroscience to explain how our brains learn. She highlights the importance of developing students' cognitive processing skills - such as attention, memory, and reasoning - to increase their capacity to learn independently.

The book presents a number of strategies teachers can use to develop these skills in their students. This includes using storytelling as a teaching tool, fostering a sense of community in the classroom, creating opportunities for collaborative problem-solving, and incorporating real-world contexts into learning activities.

Finally, Hammond addresses some of the challenges involved in implementing culturally responsive teaching. These include overcoming unconscious bias, addressing language barriers, and building relationships with families and communities.

Throughout "Culturally Responsive Teaching and The Brain", Hammond emphasizes that this approach is not just about being sensitive to cultural differences but also about leveraging these differences to enhance learning.
