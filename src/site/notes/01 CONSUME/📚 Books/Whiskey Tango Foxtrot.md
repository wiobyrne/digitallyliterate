## Extended Summary
"Whiskey Tango Foxtrot" centers on three main characters: Leila Majnoun, a disillusioned nonprofit worker; Leo Crane, an off-the-grid trustafarian; and Mark Deveraux, a self-help guru who's risen to fame with his book series. The trio is unknowingly brought together by an underground organization called Dear Diary that aims to combat the Committee - an immensely influential conglomerate that controls global information flow.

Leila stumbles upon this vast conspiracy during her work in Myanmar when she witnesses something she wasn't supposed to see. Trying to unearth more about what she saw leads her towards Dear Diary.

Leo becomes involved when he discovers his late brothers' involvement with Dear Diary after inheriting their marijuana farm. His paranoia and substance abuse make him susceptible to Dear Diary's recruitment efforts.

Meanwhile, Mark becomes entangled with the Committee after they approach him to be their public face due to his growing influence as a self-help author.

As these three disparate lives intertwine in unexpected ways amid paranoia and manipulation from all sides, they must decide where their loyalties lie.

The narrative weaves technological surveillance themes with personal stories of addiction (Leo), ambition (Leila), and the pursuit of fame (Mark) in a world where privacy has become a commodity, and information is power.
