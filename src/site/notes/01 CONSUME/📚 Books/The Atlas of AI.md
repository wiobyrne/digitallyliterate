**Author:** [[01 CONSUME/üë• People/Kate Crawford\|Kate Crawford]]

---

## Three-Sentence Summary
- "The Atlas of AI" uncovers the real world impact of artificial intelligence, beyond its digital interface, including environmental damage, labor exploitation and data bias.
- Kate Crawford delves into the materials required to build AI technologies, their toll on the environment and the power structures that drive this industry. 
- She advocates for a more holistic understanding and regulation of artificial intelligence that considers human rights, democratic values and environmental sustainability.

## Extended Summary
"The Atlas of AI" by Kate Crawford is an insightful exploration into the often overlooked physical realities and impacts of artificial intelligence (AI). The book takes readers on a journey from mines that produce minerals for AI technology, factory floors where these devices are assembled by exploited workers, to the data centers that store our information. 

Crawford offers an in-depth look at how AI technologies are far from ethereal or neutral but are rooted in real-world complexities. The author underscores how these technologies are forged from natural resources which have severe ecological implications due to destructive mining practices and energy consumption during production. 

She also highlights how vast amounts of personal data needed to train these systems can lead to privacy infringements and reinforce systemic biases. The book reveals how power structures control and benefit from these processes while perpetuating inequality.

Instead of preaching doom or blindly championing progress, Crawford proposes a balanced approach that questions assumptions about AI's neutrality and universality. She calls for stricter regulations on data collection, acknowledging workers' rights in the tech industry, mitigating environmental impact, and developing more ethical algorithms.

---

## Key Points
1. AI technologies have tangible physical realities with significant environmental implications due to resource extraction and energy consumption.
2. The development and deployment of AI can perpetuate inequalities through exploitative labor practices in tech manufacturing sectors and biased algorithms.
3. A balanced approach is necessary to regulate AI technologies, considering human rights, environmental sustainability, and ethical implications of data collection and algorithm design.

## Who Should Read
"The Atlas of AI" is compelling for anyone interested in the wider impacts of artificial intelligence. It is particularly valuable for tech enthusiasts, policymakers, environmentalists and human rights advocates seeking a more comprehensive understanding of the AI industry beyond its digital fa√ßade.

- The first myth is that nonhuman systems (be it computers or horses) are analogues for human minds. This perspective assumes that with sufficient training, or enough resources, humanlike intelligence can be created from scratch, without addressing the fundamental ways in which humans are embodied, relational, and set within wider ecologies.

- There were simply some complicated human tasks that would take more time to be formalized and solved by machines.12 [Location¬†92](https://readwise.io/open/559374510)

- less formal aspects of intelligence must be abstracted, eliminated, or approximated for computers, leaving them unable to process information about situations as humans do. [Location¬†98](https://readwise.io/open/559374511)

- As author and engineer Ellen Ullman puts it, this belief that the mind is like a computer, and vice versa, has ‚Äúinfected decades of thinking in the computer and cognitive sciences,‚Äù creating a kind of original sin for the field. [Location¬†106](https://readwise.io/open/559374512)

- In contrast, in this book I argue that AI is neither artificial nor intelligent. Rather, artificial intelligence is both embodied and material, made from natural resources, fuel, human labor, infrastructures, logistics, histories, and classifications. [Location¬†124](https://readwise.io/open/559374515)

- AI systems are ultimately designed to serve existing dominant interests. In this sense, artificial intelligence is a registry of power. [Location¬†129](https://readwise.io/open/559374516)

- To understand how AI is fundamentally political, we need to go beyond neural nets and statistical pattern recognition to instead ask what is being optimized, and for whom, and who gets to decide. [Location¬†142](https://readwise.io/open/559374518)

{ #rw559374521}


- an atlas is as much an act of creativity‚Äîa subjective, political, and aesthetic intervention‚Äîas it is a scientific collection. [Location¬†151](https://readwise.io/open/559374522)

- We need a theory of AI that accounts for the states and corporations that drive and dominate it, the extractive mining that leaves an imprint on the planet, the mass capture of data, and the profoundly unequal and increasingly exploitative labor practices that sustain it. [Location¬†163](https://readwise.io/open/559374526)

- This colonizing impulse centralizes power in the AI field: it determines how the world is measured and defined while simultaneously denying that this is an inherently political activity. [Location¬†176](https://readwise.io/open/559374527)

{ #rw601584594}


- how artificial intelligence functions as a structure of power that combines infrastructure, capital, and labor. From the Uber driver being nudged to the undocumented immigrant being tracked to the public housing tenants contending with facial recognition systems in their homes, AI systems are built with the logics of capital, policing, and militarization‚Äîand this combination further widens the existing asymmetries of power. [Location¬†261](https://readwise.io/open/601584595)
{ #rw601584595}


- Artificial intelligence, then, is an idea, an infrastructure, an industry, a form of exercising power, and a way of seeing; it‚Äôs also a manifestation of highly organized capital backed by vast systems of extraction and logistics, with supply chains that wrap around the entire planet. [Location¬†269](https://readwise.io/open/601584596)
{ #rw601584596}


- The task is to remain sensitive to the terrain and to watch the shifting and plastic meanings of the term ‚Äúartificial intelligence‚Äù‚Äîlike a container into which various things are placed and then removed‚Äîbecause that, too, is part of the story. [Location¬†280](https://readwise.io/open/601584597)
{ #rw601584597}


- This is why we must contend with AI as a political, economic, cultural, and scientific force. As Alondra Nelson, Thuy Linh Tu, and Alicia Headlam Hines observe, ‚ÄúContests around technology are always linked to larger struggles for economic mobility, political maneuvering, and community building.‚Äù36 [Location¬†290](https://readwise.io/open/601584598)
