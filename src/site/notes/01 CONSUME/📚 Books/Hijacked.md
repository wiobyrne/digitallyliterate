## Extended Summary
Elizabeth Anderson's *Hijacked* explores the ideological roots of neoliberalism, revealing how it has perverted the seventeenth-century Protestant work ethic to benefit the One Percent at the expense of workers. Neoliberalism is described as an ideology that prioritizes market orderings over state regulation, transferring power from public governance to private employers. The book contrasts two interpretations of the work ethic: a conservative version that demands relentless toil and submission from workers while glorifying capital owners, and a progressive version that advocates worker dignity, self-government, and social democracy. Anderson argues that neoliberal policies degrade workers' autonomy and capabilities while perpetuating class-based power struggles. She calls for renewing the progressive work ethic to empower employees through measures like worker cooperatives and equitable resource distribution.

## Key Points
1. Neoliberalism exploits the Protestant work ethic to justify labor commodification and employer dominance.
2. The conservative work ethic stigmatizes poverty while glorifying capital owners as exemplars of virtue.
3. Reclaiming the progressive work ethic can promote social democracy, worker empowerment, and equitable economic systems.
