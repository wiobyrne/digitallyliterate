## Extended Summary
Gabrielle Zevin's "Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow" is a sweeping narrative that follows the lives of Sam Masur and Sadie Green over three decades, from their chance encounter as children in a hospital to their rise as successful video game designers. The story explores their complex relationship, which defies traditional categorization â€“ they are friends, creative partners, and soulmates, but never romantic lovers.

The novel is set against the backdrop of the rapidly evolving video game industry, serving as both a chronicle of technological advancement and a metaphor for the characters' personal growth. Sam, a Korean-American with a physical disability, and Sadie, from a privileged background, navigate the challenges of their identities within this competitive field. Their journey is marked by creative triumphs, personal setbacks, and the constant tension between their individual ambitions and their deep connection to each other.

Zevin skillfully weaves themes of identity, disability, sexism, and cultural appropriation throughout the narrative, using the video game medium as a lens to explore these complex issues. The story is punctuated by their game creations, each reflecting the personal and professional challenges they face at different stages of their lives.

The novel's structure is non-linear, incorporating flashbacks and foreshadowing to create a rich, layered narrative. This approach mirrors the nature of video games, where players can explore multiple paths and outcomes. The omniscient narrator provides deep insights into the characters' thoughts and motivations, allowing readers to understand the complexities of their relationships and decisions.

While Sam and Sadie are the central focus, the novel also introduces a cast of supporting characters who play crucial roles in their lives. Most notably, Marx, their friend and business partner, whose presence (and later absence) significantly impacts the protagonists' journey."

Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow" is ultimately a meditation on the nature of love, creativity, and human connection. It challenges conventional notions of romance, suggesting that the most profound relationships can transcend traditional categories. Through Sam and Sadie's story, Zevin explores the idea that true partnership â€“ whether in friendship or creative endeavors â€“ requires vulnerability, forgiveness, and the ability to grow together through conflicts and misunderstandings.

## Key Points

1. The novel explores the complexities of long-term friendship and creative partnership, challenging traditional notions of love and romance.
2. Video games serve as both a central plot element and a metaphor for life, representing themes of identity, second chances, and the desire for control and reinvention.
