## Extended Summary
"Anthem" is a dystopian novel by Noah Hawley set in a future totalitarian state where individuals have no names, only numbers. The protagonist, Equality 7-2521, is different from his peers as he possesses curiosity and intellect that the society seeks to suppress. He works as a street sweeper but secretly conducts scientific experiments in an underground tunnel he's discovered.

Equality falls in love with Liberty 5-3000, a woman he meets while she's working in the fields. Their relationship is forbidden by their society's laws which discourage personal connections. Despite this, they continue to meet secretly.

One day, Equality makes an important scientific discovery - electricity. He presents his findings to the World Council of Scholars hoping they would see its potential benefits. However, they are horrified by his act of independent thought and innovation and vow to destroy his invention.

Fleeing from the Council's wrath, Equality takes refuge in an uncharted forest where Liberty soon joins him. In their solitude away from society's constraints, they rediscover their individual identities. They come across books from the past world which introduces them to concepts like 'I' and 'ego'. This leads Equality to realize that man's highest moral purpose is the pursuit of his own happiness.

In the end, Equality vows to build a new society based on individualism and freedom. He discards his old name and takes on a new one, Prometheus, symbolizing his defiance and the new path he's charting for humanity.

"Anthem" is a powerful critique of collectivism, emphasizing the importance of individuality, self-reliance and freedom. It also highlights the destructive effects of suppressing human spirit and creativity.
