## Extended Summary
Red Mars is set in the near future where Earth is facing overpopulation and ecological collapse. A multinational consortium sends a group known as the "First Hundred" to colonize Mars. These individuals are tasked with terraforming the planet and creating a livable environment for future generations. 

The narrative follows several key characters among the First Hundred: John Boone, Maya Toitovna, Frank Chalmers, Arkady Bogdanov, Nadia Chernyshevski, among others. Each character embodies different ideologies and perspectives on how best to establish a society on Mars.

A major theme in 'Red Mars' is the tension between Earth's control over Martian affairs and the growing desire for independence among Martian citizens. This tension eventually culminates in a violent revolution led by Bogdanov against Earth's control.

The book also delves into intricate details about terraforming processes - like creating an atmosphere or warming up the planet - with scientific accuracy that lends credibility to Robinson's vision of colonizing Mars.

At its core, 'Red Mars' is not just about humans colonizing another planet; it's about humanity's struggle with itself â€“ our proclivity for self-destruction versus our capability for innovation and survival.
