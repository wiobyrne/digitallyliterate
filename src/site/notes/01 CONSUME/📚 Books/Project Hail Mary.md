## Extended Summary
"Project Hail Mary" by Andy Weir is a gripping sci-fi thriller about survival, friendship and the lengths one will go to save humanity. The story begins with Ryland Grace awakening from a coma on a spaceship with no memory of who he is or why he's there. Slowly, as his memory returns in flashes, he realizes that he’s the last surviving member of a desperate mission called Project Hail Mary designed to save Earth from impending doom.

The threat comes from an alien microbe, named Astrophage, which has colonized our Sun and is sapping its energy at an alarming rate. Unless it’s stopped, Earth will soon freeze over. Ryland, who was a high school science teacher before being drafted into this interstellar mission due to his unique scientific insights about Astrophage, has been sent alone into space to find a solution.

During his mission, Ryland encounters an alien life form for the first time - Rocky - from another civilization also threatened by Astrophage. Despite their differences and initial mistrust, they form an unlikely friendship and become allies in their common pursuit.
