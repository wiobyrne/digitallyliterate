## Extended Summary

_The Harrow_ (published May 1, 2025) is Noah Eatonâ€™s sharply plotted debut novel that blends crime thriller conventions with biting social commentary. Set in modern London, it centers on The Harrowâ€”a tenacious but cash-strapped local investigative magazine determined to expose scandal, corruption, and gangland crimes.

John Salmon, the magazineâ€™s embittered editor, has fought for years to preserve its legacy. Into this fraught world steps Danny Roth, a rookie journalist fresh out of university. Danny convinces John to let him pursue a grisly gangland murderâ€”and soon their investigations collide with a council coverâ€‘up John's been quietly tracking. As they dig deeper, they face threats from criminal and political powers, placing their careersâ€”and livesâ€”on the line.

Eaton structures the narrative as a classic whodunit with red herrings, unexpected alliances, and mounting danger, all narrated with a dry, dark wit. Characters are vividly drawn: John, with his grizzled integrity; Danny, whose youthful ambition and naivetÃ© inject energy and risk; and a cast of gangsters, corrupt officials, and misfits who populate both London's underbelly and council chambers.

Beyond its plot, _The Harrow_ is a metaâ€‘text on journalismâ€™s decline. It laments the extinction of local muckâ€‘raking in favor of instant digital content, while championing the power of tenacious reporting to hold power to account. The novel's toneâ€”equal parts gritty and wryâ€”uses humor and suspense to probe questions of truth, responsibility, and the price of exposing wrongdoing.
