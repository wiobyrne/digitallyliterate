## Extended Summary
"The Self-Driven Child: The Science and Sense of Giving Your Kids More Control Over Their Lives" is authored by William Stixrud, a clinical neuropsychologist, and Ned Johnson, a motivational coach. They combine their expertise in neuroscience, psychology, and education to present a compelling case for why children need more autonomy in order to succeed in the rapidly changing 21st century.

The book begins with an exploration of the concept of control as it pertains to child development. Drawing on recent findings from neuroscience, the authors explain how feeling in control is associated with better mental health outcomes, including lower levels of stress and anxiety.

The authors then delve into the topic of motivation. They argue that intrinsic motivation - the desire to do something because it is personally rewarding - is key to learning, creativity, problem-solving and overall success in life. However, they warn that this type of motivation can be undermined by excessive parental control or pressure.

In order to cultivate self-driven children who are motivated from within rather than by external rewards or threats of punishment, Stixrud and Johnson suggest several strategies parents can adopt. These include giving kids more choice whenever possible; respecting their opinions; helping them set their own goals; encouraging healthy sleep habits; not over-scheduling them; teaching them mindfulness techniques; and providing them with unconditional support.

The authors assert that by fostering a sense of control and intrinsic motivation, parents can help their children become more resilient, confident, and capable of meeting the challenges of adulthood.
