## Highlights

- The Almagest shows our ability to problem solve
- The Almagest shows that: if it practically works, it's more believable
- The Almagest shows our ability to force fit incorrect solutions, and then believe those solutions
- The Almagest shows how we conflate some truth in a person, statement, or idea, with total truth 
- Belief governs reality
- Even in the face of overwhelming evidence, Belief finds a way
- The fluid in the ear keeps our equilibrium, 
- We have an existential protection mechanism that filters out details that challenge our beliefs
- When reality disproves our beliefs, we either ignore, punch back, distract, ("whataboutism"), or tack onto the narrative
- When reality disproves our beliefs, it's easier to change the narrative protecting our beliefs, than to actually change our beliefs
- Be careful what you believe, because your beliefs exert mind control on you
- Geocentrism shows our vanity, our ego, our narcissism
