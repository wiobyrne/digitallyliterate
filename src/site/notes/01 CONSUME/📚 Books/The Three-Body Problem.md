## Extended Summary
"The Three-Body Problem" by Cixin Liu is a compelling mix of historical events and hard science fiction. The narrative begins during China's Cultural Revolution, introducing us to Ye Wenjie, a physicist who witnesses her father being killed by Red Guards due to his scientific beliefs. She is later sent to a remote radar base called Red Coast Base, where she makes first contact with an alien civilization from the Alpha Centauri star system.

This civilization, Trisolaris, is struggling due to its chaotic three-star system (the three-body problem). Learning of Earth's position in a stable one-star system, they decide to invade Earth. Trisolarans manipulate human scientists using a virtual reality game called "Three Body," providing clues about their existence and intentions.

In present-day Beijing, we meet Wang Miao, a nanomaterials researcher who stumbles upon the "Three Body" game and the mysterious deaths of several scientists. Teaming up with police officer Shi Qiang, they uncover the existence of ETO (Earth-Trisolaris Organization), a group of human defectors working with Trisolarans.

The book presents complex scientific concepts and philosophies about humanity's place in the cosmos. It ends on a cliffhanger as Ye sends another message into space despite knowing it will expedite Earth's invasion.
