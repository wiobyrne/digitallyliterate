## Extended Summary
"In The Wake: On Blackness and Being" by Christina Sharpe is an exploration of the enduring impact of slavery on contemporary black life. Sharpe employs various metaphors related to water, ship and wake to analyze how the Atlantic slave trade has left a lasting mark on African diaspora. The ‘wake’ here refers both to the path that a ship leaves behind in water as well as state of vigil kept beside a dead body – revealing how black individuals continue to navigate through a world shaped by slavery’s traumatic history.

Sharpe introduces us to the concept of “wake work,” which involves consciously living with and acknowledging this past. She argues that it's not enough for Black people merely survive; they must actively engage with their history in order to truly live. 

The book is divided into different sections each focusing on themes like "The Ship," "The Hold," and "The Weather." Each section uses personal stories, contemporary art pieces, literature, films etc., to dissect varied dimensions of black existence in relation to their past. 

For instance, she discusses how images depicting police violence against Black individuals can be traced back to public executions during slave era. Similarly, she explores how black bodies continue to be devalued and objectified, drawing parallels between contemporary experiences and historical events.

Throughout the book, Sharpe emphasizes that understanding this history is integral to resisting ongoing racial violence. She encourages readers to keep 'waking' – staying alert and aware of these systemic injustices and their historical roots.
