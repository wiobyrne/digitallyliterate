The book is divided into five thematic sections: Words, Flesh, Love, Faith, and Hope. Each section delves into different facets of human experience and understanding. The 'Words' section explores how language shapes our reality. 'Flesh' discusses our physical realities and how they connect us to each other and the world around us. 'Love' examines the many forms love can take and its transformative power. 'Faith' considers religious beliefs but also broader notions of faith as trust in life itself despite its uncertainties. And finally 'Hope' emphasizes the importance of maintaining hope even in the face of adversity.

Throughout these explorations, Tippett emphasizes that wisdom is not just about accumulating knowledge or adhering to moral codes but involves an ongoing process of growth and learning that requires vulnerability and openness.
