## Extended Summary
"Woken Furies" follows Takeshi Kovacs as he navigates through his dystopian home planet Harlan's World with a single-minded pursuit of revenge for the death of his former lover. The novel explores themes like transcience of life, identity crisis due to digitization of human consciousness, and socio-political issues prevalent in this dystopian society.

The narrative is non-linear and goes back-and-forth between Kovacs' past and present encounters. It reveals how he gets entangled with a group called ‘The Little Blue Bugs’ who are fighting against the ruling oligarchy on Harlan’s World. At the same time, he is being hunted by an earlier version of himself that has been unleashed by those who fear him.

Kovacs’ journey leads him through various deadly confrontations where he must deal with not just physical threats but also psychological ones as he battles internal demons from his past life and comes face-to-face with another version of himself.

By exploring the concept of multiple versions of oneself existing simultaneously due to digital consciousness transfer technology, Morgan raises questions about what constitutes identity and selfhood in such an advanced technological society.

"Woken Furies" is marked by its gritty storytelling, deep character development, and exploration of socio-political themes set against the backdrop of a dark, dystopian future.
