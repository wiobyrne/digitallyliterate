# Shop Class as Soulcraft

**Author:** [[01 CONSUME/👥 People/Matthew B. Crawford\|Matthew B. Crawford]] • [[01 CONSUME/📚 Books/📚 Books\|📚 Books]]
---

## Three-Sentence Summary
- "Shop Class as Soulcraft" is a philosophical exploration of the value and satisfaction derived from manual work.
- The author argues that manual professions like carpentry or motorcycle repair are more intellectually stimulating and personally fulfilling than many white-collar jobs.
- Crawford critiques the modern education system's emphasis on academic knowledge over practical skills, suggesting that this hierarchical view of labor is misguided and harmful.

---

## Extended Summary
In "Shop Class as Soulcraft," Matthew B. Crawford combines personal narrative with philosophical insight to examine the nature of work in contemporary society. Drawing from his own experiences as an electrician and motorcycle mechanic, he contrasts the tangible rewards of manual labor with the often abstract and disconnected tasks of white-collar jobs.

Crawford questions our cultural assumption that knowledge work is somehow superior to manual work. He argues that many seemingly menial tasks require complex problem-solving abilities, a deep understanding of various systems, and a level of expertise that is undervalued in our society.

The book criticizes the current education system for encouraging students to pursue academic careers at the expense of practical skills. Crawford suggests that this one-size-fits-all approach ignores individual aptitudes and interests, leading to job dissatisfaction and a loss of craftsmanship pride.

Through this exploration, "Shop Class as Soulcraft" challenges readers to reconsider their perceptions about different types of work and to value all forms of labor equally.

---

## Key Points
1. Manual work often requires complex problem-solving abilities and deep knowledge.
2. Society tends to undervalue manual labor compared to white-collar jobs.
3. The current education system may discourage the pursuit of practical skills, leading to job dissatisfaction and a loss of craftsmanship.

---

## Who Should Read
This book is perfect for anyone feeling dissatisfied or disconnected in their current job, especially those in white-collar professions. Craftsmen, tradespeople or anyone interested in philosophical discussions about work and education will find this book particularly insightful.

## Readwise Highlights

- The disappearance of tools from our common education is the first step toward a wider ignorance of the world of artifacts we inhabit. And, in fact, an engineering culture has developed in recent years in which the object is to “hide the works,” rendering many of the devices we depend on every day unintelligible to direct inspection.

- In schools, we create artificial learning environments for our children that they know to be contrived and undeserving of their full attention and engagement. Without the opportunity to learn through the hands, the world remains abstract, and distant, and the passions for learning will not be engaged. [Location 145](https://readwise.io/open/598395356)

- The man who works recognizes his own product in the World that has actually been transformed by his work: he recognizes himself in it, he sees in it his own human reality, in it he discovers and reveals to others the objective reality of his humanity, of the originally abstract and purely subjective idea he has of himself.4 [Location 191](https://readwise.io/open/598395357)

- The satisfactions of manifesting oneself concretely in the world through manual competence have been known to make a man quiet and easy.

- Constantly seeking self-affirmation, the narcissist views everything as an extension of his will, and therefore has only a tenuous grasp on the world of objects as something independent.

- Such a strong ontology is somewhat at odds with the cutting-edge institutions of the new capitalism, and with the educational regime that aims to supply those institutions with suitable workers—pliable generalists unfettered by any single set of skills.

- Of the Smith-Hughes Act’s two rationales for shop class, vocational and general ed, only the latter emphasized the learning of aesthetic, mathematical, and physical principles through the manipulation of material things. It is not surprising, then, that the act came four years after Henry Ford’s innovation of the assembly line. The nascent two-track educational scheme mirrored the assembly line’s severing of the cognitive aspects of manual work from its physical execution. [Location 395](https://readwise.io/open/598395367)

- The critical divide in the future may instead be between those types of work that are easily deliverable through a wire (or via wireless connections) with little or no diminution in quality and those that are not. And this unconventional divide does not correspond well to traditional distinctions between jobs that require high levels of education and jobs that do not.18 [Location 419](https://readwise.io/open/599244868)

- Often this sense making entails not so much problem solving as problem finding. When you do the math problems at the back of a chapter in an algebra textbook, you are problem solving. If the chapter is entitled “Systems of two equations with two unknowns,” you know exactly which methods to use. In such a constrained situation, the pertinent context in which to view the problem has already been determined, so there is no effort of interpretation required. But in the real world, problems don’t present themselves in this predigested way; usually there is too much information, and it is difficult to know what is pertinent and what isn’t. Knowing what kind of problem you have on hand means knowing what features of the situation can be ignored. Even the boundaries of what counts as “the situation” can be ambiguous; making discriminations of pertinence cannot be achieved by the application of rules, and requires the kind of judgment that comes with experience. The value and job security of the mechanic lie in the fact that he has this firsthand, personal knowledge. [Location 446](https://readwise.io/open/599244870)

- It seems we must take a cold-eyed view of “knowledge work,” and reject the image of a rising sea of pure mentation that lifts all boats. More likely is a rising sea of clerkdom.
