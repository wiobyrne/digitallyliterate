## Extended Summary
The narrative is structured around one drop of water, introduced in ancient Nineveh with King Ashurbanipal and the Epic of Gilgamesh. Moving to Victorian London (circa 1840), Arthur Smyth, dubbed ‚ÄúKing Arthur of the Sewers,‚Äù is born beside the Thames. Gifted with prodigious memory, he becomes an apprentice printer and later a scholar of cuneiform texts. In 2014, Narin, a ten-year-old Yazidi girl near the Tigris, faces baptism rites disrupted by conflict and displacement under ISIS, reflecting her community‚Äôs ongoing suffering. Finally, in 2018, Zaleekhah, a hydrologist on a London houseboat, grapples with personal loss, environmental concerns, and rediscovery of heritage. These timelines intersect through water‚Äôs symbolic presence‚Äîfrom a raindrop to a snowflake, baptismal tear, and back‚Äîemphasizing collective memory, trauma, resilience, and the ethics of cultural heritage.
