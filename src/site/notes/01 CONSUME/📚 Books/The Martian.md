## Extended Summary
> "The Martian" by Andy Weir follows the tale of astronaut Mark Watney who becomes stranded alone on Mars when his crew leaves him behind, thinking he died in a storm. With limited supplies and no way to communicate with Earth, Watney must rely on his ingenuity and perseverance to survive. He repurposes equipment for farming inside the habitat and generates water by burning hydrogen. He manages to communicate with NASA using the Pathfinder probe's communication system that was left on Mars from an earlier mission.

> Meanwhile on Earth, NASA realizes that Watney is alive and strategizes a rescue plan. Despite setbacks such as supply probe explosion and habitat airlock failure which nearly kills him, Watney remains resilient. Eventually, he modifies Mars rovers to travel across Mars' treacherous landscape to reach Ares 4 landing site where a return vehicle is waiting.

> The narrative interlaces Watney's log entries documenting his struggles and triumphs with third-person perspectives of NASA officials and his crew members aboard spaceship Hermes who learn about his survival. The book ends with a daring space rescue, where Watney is successfully retrieved and returned to Earth.
