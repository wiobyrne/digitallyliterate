## Extended Summary
"Seveneves" by Neal Stephenson opens with a catastrophic event: the moon explodes into seven pieces. Scientists quickly realize that these fragments will eventually crash into each other creating a meteor shower ("Hard Rain") on Earth that will wipe out all life.

In an effort to preserve humanity, nations come together to create a "Cloud Ark", essentially transforming the International Space Station into a makeshift ark populated by selected humans and genetic samples. After several political and survivalist conflicts among the inhabitants and several tragic events, only eight women are left with enough genetic material to repopulate humanity when Earth becomes habitable again in roughly 5,000 years.

Fast forward to 5,000 years later where we see the descendants of these "seven Eves", who have evolved into seven distinct races based on their matriarch's genetic alterations. They live in vast structures orbiting Earth, which has recovered from Hard Rain but is still undergoing terraforming.

The second part of the book explores this new society’s complex political structure (based on their matriarchal lineage), their advanced technology (including robotics and bioengineering), and their first contact with humans who had survived underground on Earth during Hard Rain. The novel ends with suspense as two groups set off to explore a newly discovered part of their engineered habitat.
