# Foreign Fruit: A Personal History of the Orange
**Author:** [[01 CONSUME/👥 People/Katie Goh\|Katie Goh]] • [[01 CONSUME/📚 Books/📚 Books\|📚 Books]]

## Three-Sentence Summary

In "Foreign Fruit: A Personal History of the Orange," Katie Goh weaves together a hybrid memoir that explores the orange as a metaphor for hybridity, inheritance, and identity. As a queer person of Chinese, Malaysian, and Irish heritage raised in Northern Ireland, Goh parallels her complex cultural background with the orange's journey across continents and its genetic tendency toward multiplicity. Through this elegant exploration, Goh refuses simple narratives about herself and the fruit, instead creating a complex meditation on colonialism, belonging, and the restrictive nature of conventional identity narratives.

## Extended Summary

"Foreign Fruit: A Personal History of the Orange" began after the 2021 Atlanta spa shootings, when Goh, rejecting a request to write a quick response piece about anti-Asian hate crimes, instead ate five oranges at her parents' kitchen table—a moment that inspired her to see the fruit as a lens through which to examine her own complex identity.

The book follows both oranges and Goh's personal journeys, beginning in China (where sweet oranges were first cultivated and where Goh's paternal ancestry lies), through Malaysia (where her grandparents live), and into Europe. Throughout, Goh draws parallels between the orange's botanical nature—its genetic "inherent divergence" and tendency to cross-pollinate, producing unpredictable results unless controlled through grafting—and her own multicultural identity.

Unlike her earlier writing that catered to what critics call "the first-person industrial complex," where traumatic experiences were packaged into neat viral essays, "Foreign Fruit" uses oranges as a cipher that allows Goh to write about herself indirectly. Each chapter braids together citrus history with Goh's travels, family stories, and reflections on hybridity. The narrative includes cinematic historical scenes alongside personal experiences, such as visiting her father's ancestral village in Fujian, constructing her family tree in Kuala Lumpur, and examining how colonization—from Britain's conquest of Malaysia to her education in Northern Ireland—shaped her understanding of history and self.

While the book offers much food for thought and showcases Goh's talents as a prose stylist, the review notes that her choice to structure her personal journey around literal travels sometimes limits opportunities for deeper reflection.
