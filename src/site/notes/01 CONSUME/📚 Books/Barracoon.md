## Extended Summary

"Barracoon: The Story of the Last 'Black Cargo'" by Zora Neale Hurston is a non-fiction work based on interviews conducted by Hurston with Cudjo Lewis, the last survivor of Clotilda, the final slave ship to arrive in America. Captured in Africa when he was 19 years old, Cudjo was enslaved for five years before being emancipated by Union soldiers. He went on to live for more than 70 years as a free man.

Hurston provides a detailed account of Cudjo's life story - from his early life in Africa, being captured and sold into slavery, enduring the Middle Passage's horrors, experiencing slavery in America, gaining freedom after the Civil War, establishing an all-black town (Africatown), marrying and having children.

The narrative structure is primarily chronological but frequently intersperses Lewis' own words with Hurston's observations and commentary. The use of vernacular dialogue captures Lewis' unique voice and tells an intimate tale about survival against all odds. 

Through this story, Hurst explores themes like racial injustice, resilience amid adversity, cultural memory and human dignity. She critiques racist practices that allowed Lewis' enslavement while also highlighting the rich cultural heritage of African societies and the resilience and dignity of African people.
