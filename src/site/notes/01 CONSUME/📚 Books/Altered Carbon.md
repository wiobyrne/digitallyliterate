## Three-Sentence Summary
- "Altered Carbon" is a cyberpunk novel set in a futuristic society where human consciousness can be stored digitally and transferred into new bodies. The story follows Takeshi Kovacs, a former U.N. envoy turned private investigator, who is hired to investigate the apparent suicide of a wealthy man whose mind was backed up, so he should have no memory of his death. The book explores themes of identity, mortality, and the value of life in a society where death can be temporary.

## Extended Summary
In "Altered Carbon," Richard Morgan presents a grim vision of the future where human minds can be digitized and downloaded into new bodies (known as "sleeves"), essentially making physical death obsolete. The protagonist, Takeshi Kovacs, is an ex-UN Envoy (super-soldier), who wakes up in a new body on Earth after being killed on another planet. A wealthy man named Laurens Bancroft has hired him to solve his own murder â€“ Bancroft died but was revived from a backup stored 48 hours before his death, leaving him with no memory of what occurred.

Kovacs navigates through high society and the seedy underbelly of Bay City (former San Francisco) to unravel the mystery behind Bancroft's death. Along the way, he encounters various characters like Kristin Ortega, an Earth police officer who becomes Kovacs's ally and love interest; Reileen Kawahara, Kovacsâ€™s once sister-in-arms turned crime lord; and Poe, an Artificial Intelligence owning The Raven hotel.

The narrative explores heavy themes such as class disparity â€“ those who can afford it can live practically forever by changing sleeves while others suffer from substandard bodies or virtual imprisonment. It also delves into questions about identity â€“ are we just the sum of our memories? Can we truly be said to be alive if our existence is just a digital copy? These existential dilemmas are woven into a gritty, action-packed detective story that keeps readers engaged till the end.

## Key Points
- The concept of "resleeving" presents a future where death is not permanent, creating a society with significant class disparities and moral ambiguities.
- Takeshi Kovacs, as a protagonist, embodies this world's complexity â€“ he's both a product and critic of this system.
- The novel questions the nature of identity and existence in a world where consciousness can be digitized and bodies are replaceable commodities.
