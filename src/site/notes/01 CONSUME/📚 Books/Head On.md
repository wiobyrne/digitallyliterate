## Extended Summary
In "Head On," John Scalzi presents a gripping narrative set in the near future after an epidemic known as Haden's syndrome has swept across the globe, leaving its victims 'locked-in' their bodies, unable to move or respond to stimulus. To accommodate these victims, referred to as Hadens, technology has been developed to allow them to interact with the world through robotic bodies known as 'threeps.'

The story follows FBI agents Chris Shane and Leslie Vann as they investigate what seems to be a straightforward case of Hilketa player dying during a game. However, things quickly take unexpected turns when it's revealed that the player died not from game-related injuries but was murdered.
