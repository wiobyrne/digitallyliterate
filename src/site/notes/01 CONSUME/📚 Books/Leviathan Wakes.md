## Extended Summary
"Leviathan Wakes" is the first book in 'The Expanse' series written by James S. A. Corey (pen name for authors Daniel Abraham and Ty Franck). Set hundreds of years in the future where humanity has colonized other planets and moons within our solar system, it introduces us to two main characters—Detective Joe Miller on Ceres Station in the Belt, and Jim Holden, an officer aboard the ice hauler Canterbury.

Miller is assigned to find Julie Mao, a missing girl from a wealthy family who has become involved with radical political activists. Simultaneously, Holden's peaceful existence is shattered when his ship responds to a distress call from a derelict ship—the Scopuli—and unwittingly stumbles upon a secret that could ignite interplanetary war.

Their paths intersect when they discover that both Julie Mao and the Scopuli are connected to an alien protomolecule capable of altering life forms fundamentally. This new entity threatens not only their lives but also poses existential questions for all humans across Earth, Mars and Outer Planets Alliance (OPA).

Throughout their journey to understand this entity, Miller and Holden face conspiracies, betrayals, political power plays, and escalating tensions leading to war. As they uncover the truth, they grapple with moral dilemmas and their perceptions of right and wrong.

"Leviathan Wakes" combines elements of space opera, detective noir, horror, and political thriller. The narrative is complex yet deeply human—exploring themes of survival, identity, morality, power dynamics, and the potential consequences of humanity's expansion into space.
