## Extended Summary
The Hunger Games is a dystopian novel set in Panem, a nation that has risen from the ruins of what was once North America. The country is divided into twelve impoverished districts ruled by the wealthy Capitol. To remind these districts of their subjugation after a past rebellion and to maintain its power, the Capitol organizes an annual televised event known as The Hunger Games. 

The protagonist is 16-year-old Katniss Everdeen from District 12 who volunteers to participate in The Hunger Games in place of her younger sister Primrose. Each year two tributes from each district are randomly selected ‚Äì one boy and one girl aged between 12 and 18 ‚Äì to fight to death until only one remains standing.

Katniss's fellow tribute is Peeta Mellark, who once saved Katniss's family from starvation by giving them bread. During training sessions in Capitol and live interviews preceding the games, Peeta announces his love for Katniss which she initially takes as part of their strategy for survival but later acknowledges it as genuine.

In the arena, Katniss forms an alliance with Rue from District 11 but after Rue's death which deeply affects Katniss she becomes more determined to defy the Capitol's expectations and exploitation for entertainment. When only Katniss and Peeta remain, they refuse to kill each other. Instead, they threaten to consume poisonous berries, which would leave the games without a victor. The Capitol is forced to announce both as winners of the 74th Hunger Games.

## Readwise Highlights

- The rules of the Hunger Games are simple. In punishment for the uprising, each of the twelve districts must provide one girl and one boy, called tributes, to participate. The twenty-four tributes will be imprisoned in a vast outdoor arena that could hold anything from a burning desert to a frozen wasteland. Over a period of several weeks, the competitors must fight to the death. The last tribute standing wins. [Location¬†190](https://readwise.io/open/544344022)

How little chance we would stand of surviving another rebellion. Whatever words they use, the real message is clear. ‚ÄúLook how we take your children and sacrifice them and there‚Äôs nothing you can do. If you lift a finger, we will destroy every last one of you.
