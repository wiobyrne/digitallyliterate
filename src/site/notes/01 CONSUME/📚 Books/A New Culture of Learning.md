## Extended Summary
"A New Culture of Learning" is a thought-provoking exploration of how learning should evolve to keep pace with the rapid changes brought about by the digital age. Authors Douglas Thomas and John Seely Brown challenge traditional educational models that emphasize rote memorization and standardized testing. Instead, they advocate for a new culture of learning that embraces creativity, curiosity, and collaboration.

The authors argue that this new culture is characterized by a shift from knowing to learning — from accumulating facts to continuously adapting to change. It acknowledges that in a world where information is constantly changing and readily available, what matters more is one's ability to learn rather than what one already knows. 

Thomas and Brown propose a model where learners play an active role in their own education. They encourage learners to use technology as tools for exploration and expression, participate in online communities for collaborative learning, engage in play as a form of experimentation, and create meaningful projects that reflect their understanding.

The authors highlight real-world examples of this new culture at work. These include students using video games to understand complex concepts or virtual communities like Wikipedia that exemplify collective intelligence.

"A New Culture of Learning" asserts that this new approach not only makes learning more engaging but also equips learners with the skills needed to thrive in the 21st-century workplace. These skills include critical thinking, problem-solving, creativity, and collaboration.

The second is a bounded and structured environment that allows for unlimited agency to build and experiment with things within those boundaries.

- One of the metaphors we adopt to describe this process is cultivation. A farmer, for example, takes the nearly unlimited resources of sunlight, wind, water, earth, and biology and consolidates them into the bounded and structured environment of a garden or farm. We see the new culture of learning as a similar kind of process—but cultivating minds instead of plants. [Location 83](https://readwise.io/open/544344027)
