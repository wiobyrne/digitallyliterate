## Extended Summary
"Flash Boys" by Michael Lewis is a deep dive into the world of high-frequency trading (HFT), a controversial practice used by Wall Street insiders to gain an edge in stock market trades. Using sophisticated algorithms and ultra-fast data networks, these traders can execute trades fractions of a second faster than other investors â€“ enough time to see others' orders and adjust their own for profit.

The book follows several characters, mainly Brad Katsuyama, a trader for Royal Bank of Canada who becomes disturbed by what he perceives as corruption in the markets. After realizing that his trades are often front-run by HFT firms, he sets about investigating and eventually exposing this practice.

Katsuyama and his team discover that stock exchanges are selling preferential treatment to HFT firms allowing them to place their servers physically closer to exchange computers, giving them crucial milliseconds' advantage over other traders. This realization sparks Katsuyama's mission to create a fairer system.

He gathers a team of experts and creates IEX (Investors Exchange), aiming for transparency and fairness in high-speed trading. IEX uses speed bumps to slow down trades slightly so that everyone's orders arrive at the same time, preventing front-running.

While "Flash Boys" presents technical financial concepts, Michael Lewis does an excellent job making them understandable for non-expert readers. The book is not only an exposÃ© but also carries a narrative arc following Katsuyama's journey, adding a human element to the complex world of high-frequency trading.
