- Embrace Self-Transcendence over Self-Actualization
  Summary:
  Focusing on self-transcendence over self-actualization is crucial for those on the road less traveled.
  Operating in a top-down manner, looking towards something greater than oneself, is key to setting meaningful priorities. Maslow's hierarchy of needs, as commonly understood, is outdated as before his death, he updated it to emphasize self-transcendence as the ultimate aspiration, yet this crucial amendment has been widely overlooked.
