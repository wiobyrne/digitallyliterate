<blockquote><b>Craig Foster</b><br/><br/>At first, I struggled for several years. I had this idea. I got incredibly inspired by the son in the Kalahari, and I thought, could I ever track underwater? And it just seemed impossible because a track gets put there, and then the next swell washes it away. So there's nothing there. And then I started to notice the slime trails. So a lot of the mollusks leave very subtle slime trails and those collect tiny particles of sand. And if you're not looking very carefully, you'll never notice those, but they're actually everywhere. It's like, oh, gosh, you know. So that was the first track I saw and was very excited. And then I started seeing all these tracks on the backs of animals like that ray that I told you about. So the mollusks are interacting with that ray and I could tell how long</blockquote>

<blockquote><b>Craig Foster</b><br/><br/>Gill shark or a great white shark, tiger shark, that kind of thing. So it's fairly safe to be with those animals. And sometimes there's enormous number of them together. In the case of the seven gills, I've been with 55, 60 of them, and they're each the size of a lion. And they hunt seals, they hunt dolphins, but they don't know that I'm prey. So it's quite safe to be with them. But what has happened, and I've got a lot of relationships with these smaller creatures, And because of that, it feels as if I'm not as reliant on my human relationships. Because I have this, it feels like family, like kin in the water after a while, many years. You just feel this tremendous love for these creatures. And they've taught me so much. They're teachers for me. So I love them. And then I have these bonds. So the human relationships on land, I don't feel I need as much from them. So I think my relationship with my wonderful wife has become better because of that. And with a lot of close friends, family, something happens in the psyche. And if you imagine that throughout prehistory for countless hundreds of thousands of years, we've had these relationships with all these species.</blockquote>
