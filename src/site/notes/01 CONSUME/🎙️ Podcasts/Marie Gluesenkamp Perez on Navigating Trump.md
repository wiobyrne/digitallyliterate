Representative Marie Gluesenkamp Perez is one of just 13 Democrats to represent a district that Donald Trump won.

## Show Notes

Representative Marie Gluesenkamp Perez is one of just 13 Democrats to represent a district that Donald Trump won. Her distinctive economic message, and a willingness to buck her own party, helped her win re-election. But now the reality of the Trump era is coming home.

Gluesenkamp Perez faced raucous crowds at town halls in Washington State recently, with some of her more liberal constituents furious that she isn‚Äôt opposing the administration more forcefully. At the same time, the White House has started making economic arguments that sound very similar to ones that she‚Äôs made ‚Äì that we should consume less, produce more and import less stuff from abroad.

So I wanted to talk to her about how she‚Äôs navigating this moment. What does she think of Trump‚Äôs economic agenda? What reactions is she seeing across her district? How does a Democrat now represent both terrified liberals and loyal Trump voters?
