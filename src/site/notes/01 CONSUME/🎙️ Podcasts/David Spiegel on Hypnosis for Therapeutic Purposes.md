 Dr. David Spiegel, a Stanford University psychiatrist and expert in hypnosis, shares fascinating insights into the power of hypnosis for therapeutic purposes. He differentiates hypnosis from meditation and explains how it can manage pain and stress effectively. The conversation touches on the neurobiology of trance, how suggestibility varies among individuals, and even explores emerging fields like therapeutic psychedelics. Listeners will learn about the groundbreaking self-hypnosis app, Reveri, designed to enhance mental well-being.

## 🧠 Knowledge Development Connections

This episode explores the scientific foundations of hypnosis as a legitimate therapeutic modality, bridging neuroscience research with practical applications for pain management, stress reduction, and mental health treatment. Dr. Spiegel's work at Stanford provides evidence-based approaches to understanding consciousness, suggestibility, and the mind-body connection.
