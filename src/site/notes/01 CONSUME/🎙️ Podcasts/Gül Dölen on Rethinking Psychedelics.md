# G√ºl D√∂len on Rethinking Psychedelics

 Join Dr. G√ºl D√∂len, an associate professor at Johns Hopkins University and a trailblazer in psychedelic research, as she explores groundbreaking applications for [[psychedelics\|psychedelics]]. She discusses how these substances could reopen critical periods in the brain for disorders like [[autism\|autism]] and [[stroke\|stroke]], revealing their potential as therapeutic 'master keys.' Fascinating insights into octopuses under the influence and the intricate link between the brain and immune response further highlight the transformative power of psychedelics in [[health\|health]] and [[learning\|learning]].

## üß† Knowledge Development Connections

This episode explores groundbreaking research into how psychedelics can reopen critical periods in brain development, offering potential therapeutic applications for autism, stroke recovery, and other neurological conditions. Dr. D√∂len's work bridges neuroscience, philosophy of mind, and clinical applications in ways that could revolutionize our understanding of brain plasticity and therapeutic intervention.

### Potential Development Areas

The conversation suggests several concepts worth developing:
- Critical period reopening mechanisms and therapeutic protocols
- Theory of mind development across species and its relationship to consciousness
- Psychedelic research methodology and clinical trial design
- Extended mind thesis applications in therapeutic contexts
- Cross-species consciousness studies and comparative neuroscience
- Integration of philosophy of mind with empirical neuroscience research
- Deprivation-induced plasticity and learning optimization strategies

## Highlights
- Episode notes
  1. Philosophers have varying perspectives on the mind and its workings, including a point of view called [[theory of mind\|theory of mind]]; neuroscientists, on the other hand, are making tangible progress in answering big questions with concrete solutions.
  2. Testing the requirement of theory of mind for consciousness through observing diseases where it is impaired could provide insight into the link between consciousness and genetics.
  3. Octopuses are shown to display hunting behavior and other traits similar to humans, indicating that they may exhibit some form of theory of mind.
  4. Clinical trials for a fragile X disease drug failed despite promising animal studies, leading researchers to question the differences between animals and humans and the potential involvement of other factors.
  5. Critical periods in animal behavior, discovered by Conrad Lorentz, occur during the first 48 hours after hatching and may be reopened by psychedelics to learn in radically different environments.
  6. Deprivation may reopen our social critical period to make it easier to learn new things, which could explain why it's easier to learn languages where the dominant language is not one's own.
  7. Physical therapy can help recover lost motor function within a small window of time after a stroke, and researchers are exploring the potential of psychedelics to reopen critical periods for recovery.
  8. Tax breaks given to large corporations exceed the entire discretionary budget, and American taxpayers' investment in science and technology in the 50s and 60s made current tech ventures possible.
  9. Prominent figures recommend must-read books to explore gender issues and the world of psychedelics.

### ‚ú® Summary
Philosophers have been examining the concept of the mind from different perspectives, considering what it is and what it's not. Questions about how we know the mind and if we can compare people's descriptions arise. The concept of theory of mind is a viewpoint that has drawn interest, and it's more of a perspective than a theory like those in science. It's the shorthand for explaining what the mind is.

<blockquote><b>G√ºl D√∂len</b><br/><br/>Of mind, it's not really a branch of philosophy or anything. It's just a thing that has drawn the attention of philosophers from a variety of different perspectives. Like you can imagine considering what is the mind from a metaphysical point of view. So what are the things that we count when we say this is what a mind is, this is what a mind is not, then there are other considerations like, well, how do we know mind? Can we know mind just through introspection or is there some empirical way or some way that we can compare different people's descriptions of those things to get at what is mind? And that would be sort of the more epistemological approach to mind. And I was interested in all of those things. There continues to be debate about that. And one of the interesting ideas that I came across was that there was this concept of theory of mind, which is not really a theory in the way that we have a theory of light or a theory of synaptogenesis Or any of the more commonplace theories. It's more like it's a point of view. The shorthand way of explaining what theory of mind is that I like to tell people is it's sort of what you're doing. It's the</blockquote>
