## üß† Knowledge Development Connections

This episode presents a masterclass in epistemology through the dialogue between one of the world's foremost physicists and philosophers of science and a leading technology entrepreneur. The conversation bridges quantum physics, knowledge creation, AI development, and practical philosophy in ways that fundamentally challenge how we think about learning, discovery, and progress.

### Related Notes

<blockquote><b>Tim Ferriss</b><br/><br/>David is a visiting professor of physics at the Center for Quantum Computation, a part of the Clarendon Laboratory at Oxford University, and an honorary fellow of Wolfson College, Oxford. He works on fundamental issues in physics, particularly the quantum theory of computation and information, and especially constructor theory, which he is proposing as a new way Of formulating laws of nature. He is the author of The Fabric of Reality and The Beginning of Infinity, and he is an advocate of the philosophy of Karl Popper. You can find him online at daviddeutsch.org And I should return to what I stated initially, and that is preserving the lessons of a living legend. David is truly a pioneer in multiple fields. And the hope is that with the help of Naval, because I am in the passenger seat, I am largely silent in this conversation, that Naval can help to tease out counterintuitive learnings That you can apply to your life and apply to your life in many, many different areas. And to quote Naval, I will say, quote, I think understanding David Deutsch and Karl Popper is the easiest way to actually get smarter. Fix your epistemology and fix your thinking. So what is epistemology? Briefly, because that term comes up a lot. Simple definition of epistemology is the theory of knowledge, especially with regards to its methods, validity, and scope, and perhaps this is a key part you want to keep in mind, the Distinction between justified belief and opinion.</blockquote>

<blockquote><b>Naval Ravikant</b><br/><br/>So you're saying the knowledge of the true scientific method is embedded in the institutions of science in the PhD process?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>David Deutsch</b><br/><br/>Well, the best scientific method that we know of, and one shouldn't really think of it as a method. You know, there's this wonderful lecture by Popper when he first was made a professor at the London School of Economics. He was made a professor of scientific method. And his first six lectures, I wish the rest of them were, the first six lectures are on the internet somewhere. And he starts the first one by saying, I am the first professor of scientific method in the British Empire. The British Empire still existed at the time, more or less. And so the first thing I want to say to you is that there is no such thing as the scientific method. And then he goes on from there. So this subject does not exist. So if any of you have come here to learn the handle that you have to turn in order to make scientific knowledge come out the other end, you're going to be disappointed.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Naval Ravikant</b><br/><br/>So how do we make scientific knowledge come out the other end? How does knowledge grow? How does science grow?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>David Deutsch</b><br/><br/>According to Popper, and I entirely follow him in this matter, all knowledge, not just scientific knowledge, begins with a problem and then continues with conjectures.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Key takeaways
1. Constructor Theory is a physics theory that focuses on what can be done and can't be done and has theoretical applications but not yet practical applications
2. Universal constructors are to theory of construction what universal computers are to theory of computation
3. Gold will eventually be cheap because machines will mine it from asteroids

<blockquote><b>David Deutsch</b><br/><br/>Am working on a new theory in physics called constructor theory. And it is, to me, amazing. And one of the problems I have is how to explain to other people why it is amazing and what's good about it. And this is one of the things that you have to do later. Because the early part of understanding something new, creating something new, is to understand it yourself. And the constructors theory has already changed a lot since I first thought of it. And we're beginning to have theoretical applications of it, not yet practical applications. But you know, one day there will be universal constructors. And universal constructors are to constructor theory what universal computers are to theory of computation. So constructor theory is the theory of all things that can be done and can't be done, the distinction between things that can be done and can't be done, considered as a theory of physics. So you reformulate physics to make statements entirely about that, what can and can't be done. And then, you know, Naval, you will like the economic implications. You know, some people think that once we have universal constructors, you realize that a universal constructor can make more universal constructors, and then you have exponentially More of them as time goes on. So there'll be no role for humans anymore. But the exact opposite is true, as usual. Universal construction, just like a universal computer, is perfectly obedient. It is obedient. Humans are disobedient. You need the disobedient things to program the obedient things. So I spoke a while ago about the fact that gold is eventually going to be cheap machines will go out to the asteroids and mine the gold.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Key takeaways
1. Physical toil can be abolished using robots programmed to do the work.
2. Programming is necessary for robots to perform new tasks.
3. Existing programs can be downloaded for basic tasks.
4. Creating new programs requires hiring a programmer or doing it oneself.
5. Potential cautionary tale in the idea of universal constructors.

<blockquote><b>David Deutsch</b><br/><br/>Well, toil, physical toil will be abolished because that can be done by robots that can be built by other robots that can be and so on right down to the universal constructor. But when I say can be, they will have to be programmed to be. And if you want something done, either you will download from the internet a program where someone has already worked out how to, you know, make a perfect robot butler or whatever. But if you want something new done that hasn't been done before, and you will, then you have to write the program for it. Or hire someone to write the program for it, but then he will want a program in return.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Naval Ravikant</b><br/><br/>There's a Calvin Hobbes where Calvin has this box that becomes a universal constructor and he starts making copies of himself. So he turns the box upside down, he opens it up, another Calvin comes out. And so he commands this Calvin to do his homework. And then he creates another Calvin, and that Calvin has to go and do his chores.</blockquote>

And then he creates another Calvin, and that Calvin has to go and do his chores. And sure enough, what he ends up with is a whole bunch of Calvins who are all playing video games and eating food, and none of them actually want to do the chores or the homework, because These are the AGI, these are Calvins. And so yes, disobedience is a big one. I will say your philosophy has had a huge difference for me on child raising. And I have now realized that it is more important, even through this conversation, it is more important that I have a disobedient child than an obedient child, or an educated or learned Or whatever I may think is the right set of things. Because it is fundamentally that disobedience that allows the creativity to come up with new ideas. And it's that creativity</blockquote>
