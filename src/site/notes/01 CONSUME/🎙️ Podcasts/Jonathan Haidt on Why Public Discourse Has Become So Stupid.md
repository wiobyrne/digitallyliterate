You can still publish anonymously. Ye can ted anonymously. But to get access to the hyper viralization of a company that has this incredible benefit of section two 30 protection, in order tohe advantage of you have to just get authenticated. And it's not that facebook is going to get your drivers license. It's that they would kick you over to a third party non profit that would do the verification. That would be huge tey

### ‚ú® Summary
How do you knock out s two percentbles? It seems to me that the worst two %, but i perceive on twitter, have real names. And so those are not going to be knocked out by a verification. So here's another idea, which i've bandied about so acountally, and i's not fully baked, but something along these lines. What i'm after is te systemic change, so that people are rewarded for nuance. They are punished or ther for lose social credit for complete lack of nuwance.

<blockquote><b>Yascha Mounk</b><br/><br/>Governments to undermine our public discourse, right? So when there's a question of should the Russian state be able to run a bot army to attack people, I have no problem with saying no, you can find ways to counter those bots and so on. But as you're saying, you know, an article as well, it's actually a small number of people with pretty dark personality traits who are just able to radicalize discourse online and to Go and smear all of the more moderate people and sling those arrows at them. And so they're, you know, those are real human beings. They're citizens of the countries in which they engage in the public discourse by and large. They're often perfectly willing to display their real names. Many of them have a picture and the name out there on Twitter, and there's absolutely no reason to assume that they're false. In fact, many of them have a little blue check. So there's been some kind of verification mechanism. So that change, I worry, is going to improve things at the margin, but it's not going to deal with the real underlying mechanism. Well, first, it's not just at the margin.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Jonathan Haidt</b><br/><br/>I think the change I'm talking about would have a very big effect.

### ‚ú® Summary
If we all had that, where you could set it in that way, you can say what you want. It's not censorship. Most of us could then actually express ourselves on twitter without knowing that we'll be onsulted horribly. And most importantly, this would put pressure on people to not be assaults. Cause if yo're n asole, more people block you. Yet, as social scientists, we're trying to create a space in which and people, mi ow, I don't want your bile. Rather, i don't want bile, period.

<blockquote><b>Yascha Mounk</b><br/><br/>On Twitter have real names. And, you know, perhaps there's the worst 2% in terms of people just like spewing absolutely vile threats and murder threats and so on. But those aren't dominating this world on Twitter, right? That makes it a toxic place to be and deeply unpleasant. But the widest people are the ones who have names and have platforms and are one level above that and then will just completely smear as pedophile on the right or the right on the left, Anybody who disagrees exactly. And so those are not going to be knocked out by a verification method. That's right.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Jonathan Haidt</b><br/><br/>All right. So here's another idea, which I bandied about in Silicon Valley, and it's not in my article, it's not fully baked, but something along these lines. What I'm after is a systemic change so that people are rewarded for nuance, and they're punished, or they sort of lose social credit for complete lack of nuance. So the idea that I'd love people to know more about this to develop would be something like this. Suppose that every person, you can even have AI do this, you get rated for two things, nuance and hostility. Nuance means cognitive complexity, or let's call it that, cognitive complexity. That is the ability to have two conflicting ideas in the same tweet. You know, you couldn't do it when it was 120 characters, but 240 characters, you actually can sometimes have some cognitive complexity. Other people, you can see they have zero cognitive complexity in their tweets. And then the other thing is hostility. And so if you use a lot of curse words, A, I could figure out what's really hostile. So suppose you have a zero to five rating for every person on</blockquote>

I've spoken at many high schools and colleges about the colling te american mine. Now i talk about the prolemse of genzi.

And I I talk about the problems of Gen Z, and I always ask afterwards, okay, I've said some critical things about your generation. Do you think I got this analogy right or wrong? And, you know, it's either 100% say that I got it right, or if there are those who think I got it wrong, the conformity pressures are such that they won't speak up. I don't know. But basically, what I find is that Gen Z, they know they've got problems. They know that this stuff is damaging. They know they've got terrible anxiety and depression problems. So I think the way to think about this is not, oh, can we hope that the next generation rejects this? It's rather, can we empower the middle 80% everywhere, like kids, young adults? Can we get a democratic system in which the middle 80% actually has like 50% of the voice. Like that would be incredible.

And, you know, it's either 100% say that I got it right, or if there are those who think I got it wrong, the conformity pressures are such that they won't speak up. I don't know. But basically, what I find is that Gen Z, they know they've got problems. They know that this stuff is damaging. They know they've got terrible anxiety and depression problems. So I think the way to think about this is not, oh, can we hope that the next generation rejects this? It's rather, can we empower the middle 80% everywhere, like kids, young adults? Can we get a democratic system in which the middle 80% actually has like 50% of the voice. Like that would be incredible. Before social media, I presume it's always been the case that the most politically active are the people on the extremes. And so we have a kind of a U-shaped function where participation is lower in the middle and higher at the end. You're going to always have something like that. You're never going to have a flat line where each point on the line, everyone participates equally. And when social media becomes hyperviralized in 2009, I believe what happened is the far left 8%, the far right 8% from the Hidden Tribe study, the far left and far right, they go zooming Up and so do trolls and so do Russian agents and other foreign agents. And look, the CIA might be</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
i wish i had ended with so much more of this is that we do all have agency in our own lives. The first is cut our social imediate usage by 50 to a hundred%. Be very careful what you post. And the other is just go easier on each other. We evolve for hypocrisy, which i must read for orlesses on a good fight. Iam, giving you your home work. If you've never read verita's mind, please go and do so. Thank you yasha.

<blockquote><b>Jonathan Haidt</b><br/><br/>Is living way above its design constraint. And this is the theme of your book, which is coming out any moment now, I believe. In your wonderful book, I learned that the only democracies that have ever achieved equality and stability tend to be those that don't have diversity. And if you have diversity, it kind of helps to have a king or an emperor so that you don't have democratic processes and one group dominating another. And so the great experiment, as you call it, is can you have a diverse, secular, liberal democracy? And I think the answer is yes, but the margin for error is very small. And we are so far outside that margin of error now. So I think we're running out of time. I'm just beginning to read Barbara Walter's book, How Civil Wars Start. And it is really frightening because she says it's when you have a lot of ideologies based on identity, which is what we have on the far left and the far right. And when you have militias, which is what we have on the far right. So she sees the signs brewing for civil war. Now, don't think about like the U.S. Civil War of the 1860s. Think about more like Colombia or places where there are militias, there are killings, there are bombings, there are assassinations. And of course, we had that in the late 1960s. So we've had that before. So I think that's where we're headed. We're headed towards a Latin American style democracy. And what I mean by that is, imagine trying to have a secular liberal democracy with bad institutions that don't work and nobody trusts. And that's what they've been trying to do in many Latin American countries for 200 years now. And they've had moments of success and moments of catastrophic failure. And I think that's our future, unless we make some big changes.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Yascha Mounk</b><br/><br/>So you've given us the case for pessimism. You've given us the case for optimism. Finally, the last question is a straightforward and obvious one. What can listeners do to</blockquote>
