<blockquote><b>Lex Fridman</b><br/><br/>So my advice applies to my own life, which has been mostly spent behind the computer. And for that, you really, really have to put in the hours. And what that means is essentially it feels like a grind. I do recommend that you should at least try it in your own. That if you interview some of the most accomplished people ever, I think if they're honest with you, they're going to talk about their 20s as a journey of a lot of pain and a lot of really Hard work. I think what really happens, unfortunately, is a lot of those successful people later in life will talk about work-life balance. They'll say, you know what I learned from that process is that it's really important to get sun in the morning, to have health, to have good relationships. Hire a chef. Exactly. But I think those people have forgotten the value of the journey they took to that lesson. I think work-life balance is best learned the hard way. My own perspective, there's certain things you can only learn the hard way. And so you should learn that the hard way. Yeah, so that's definitely advice. And I should say that I admire people that work hard. If you want to get on my good side, I think are the people that give everything they got towards something. It doesn't actually matter what it is, but towards achieving excellence in a thing. That's the highest thing that we can reach for as human beings, I think, is excellence at a thing.
