- Identifying Genre in Blogging
  Summary:
  Defining the genre of one's blog is crucial for clarity and reader engagement.
  Having a consistent theme helps readers know what to expect, reducing the need for 'throat clearing' in each post. Clear genre indication from the start helps set reader expectations and enhances the overall reading experience.
  Recognizing one's tendency and being mindful of maintaining simplicity and clarity in content creation is key for successful blogging.

  Speaker 1
  This is about genre. So my blog is a long running series. It has been a series of 8,500 daily posts. So if I was starting today, I have to figure out what is the genre of my work. If you think about David Letterman's TV show, he needed to have a series called Stupid Petriks because the show wasn't Stupid Petriks, but there was a regular recurring Stupid Petriks. The show was a series of David Letterman shows. So if you are a genre as you re-enter blogging is there is a post from Tim on a regular basis and all of them are about the things we put into our body and performance, then you're fine. If that's not the case, then the question is when the reader shows up, do you need to do a lot of throat clearing to get them back on track for what you are writing about today? And so since you're starting with largely a blank slate, I said, well, if the first seven of these are in this series, then you only have to clear your throat once on the eighth day and say, Okay, now we're talking about this and you could do one of those or six of those or 12 of those. But people do better if they understand that they're going to see Dune not read the power broker. Those are different genres and you need to give them a hint as to what they're going to get.
  Speaker 2
  I like the idea of recognizing that my tendency is to, how should I be generous with myself? Be comprehensive. It's going to say overcomplicate. [Time 0:14:57](https://readwise.io/open/705814538)

- Quality Over Quantity
  Summary:
  The key to determining when a post is done lies in not overthinking it but focusing on clarity and brevity.
  By preparing posts in advance, reviewing, rewriting, and aiming for succinctness, the author ensures a consistent and impactful communication method that resonates with the audience and prompts sharing.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  All right, well, I'll do the first part first because it's easier. You asked, how do you decide or know when a post is done? And I texted back, I don't. That's the point. And then I wrote, imagine how hard it would be to have a conversation or even a text thread. If we had to think through whether our turn to talk was over before we stopped talking, right? So my model, my ritual is I write blog posts in advance. And then the night before I review them, I rewrite them, I delete them. So if I get the stomach flu, there's still going to be a blog post tomorrow. And when I rewrite a blog post, the rule is you wait, get points if you make it shorter. You don't get points if you make it longer. And if I can't boil it down more than it already is and it's not deliberately deceptive, it's done because the purpose is tell people something they already sort of know in a way that they Would be grateful for the chance to forward to other people.
  Speaker 2
  Do you say that one more time, Seth? That seems important. [Time 0:19:27](https://readwise.io/open/705814959)

- Consistency and Authenticity in Personal Branding
  Summary:
  Consistency is essential in showing up every day, maintaining a cadence, and in creating a persona for personal branding.
  The speaker portrays a character while writing blog posts, ensuring that the content aligns with this character. Streaks, often used negatively in software, should not make one feel bad.
  The speaker writes blog posts daily, inspired by Isaac Asimov, regardless of usage, emphasizing the importance of consistency in creating valuable content.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Well, I would say two things. First, I think you're talking about consistency in terms of showing up at the ballpark every day.
  Speaker 2
  Cadence. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. So I'll do that one second.
  Speaker 1
  I've never met Larry David, but I'm guessing that there are some days that Larry David is actually a nice, thoughtful person. And there is a character named Larry David as well. So the person who writes my blog is a character named Seth Godin. And I am the only person who's ever written my blog. I'm the only person who ever will write my blog. But when I am doing it, I am playing the character named Seth Godin. So if it doesn't sound like me, if it's just me authentically being tired or annoyed, I don't publish those because that's not what my character would do. This is not me exposing some mystical, mythical Seth Godin to the world. It's me portraying the character Seth Godin because it's a service. And then the second thing is streaks are usually used against us by software. And if they make you feel bad, it's not a helpful thing. But I write blog posts every single day, whether I use them or not. And I learned that from Isaac Asimov when I worked with him all those years ago. [Time 0:24:12](https://readwise.io/open/705815307)

- Simplify Ideas and Assert Optimism
  Summary:
  Simplify ideas by reducing them to their essence and avoiding hyperbole.
  Start from a place of giving the benefit of the doubt, believing that there are no bad people, just situations that lead to troubling behavior. Minimize the use of parenthetical statements to maintain the focus on the main idea.
  Construct blog posts by making a controversial assertion at the beginning, which creates attention, and then provide a contrasting, thought-provoking resolution.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  You know, I've not ever pushed myself to name them because seeing is forgetting the name of what one sees. Yeah. I guess I'd highlight a couple things. The first one is I try to begin from a place of the benefit of the doubt of there probably aren't bad people. There's just situations that cause people to do things that are troubling and a level of optimism to go with it. I try to reduce ideas to their essence without becoming hyperbolic because the voices of social media amped up the hyperbolic part. That's not a simplification. That's an exaggeration. Right. I try to eliminate parentheticals unless I really have no choice. So I will avoid saying something like, all tall people are very brave because that's ridiculous. But I will not write tall people are brave parentheses except for this person, this person, this person, and this person because now it's not worth reading. Right. So there is an assertion at the beginning that creates attention and then a release of that attention that lands an idea. So the shortest blog post I ever wrote, which I'm really proud of is first line is you don't need more time. So that's an assertion. It's controversial. People who feel overwhelmed want to challenge it. And then the delivery is you just need to decide. So that flips it upside down, takes the blame off the [Time 0:27:57](https://readwise.io/open/705815665)

- Attention-Grabbing Assertion
  Summary:
  An attention-grabbing assertion at the beginning of a blog post can create curiosity and engagement.
  By presenting a controversial statement, such as 'you don't need more time,' and following it up with a contradictory idea like 'you just need to decide,' the writer can shift responsibility back to the reader and empower them to take control of their situation. This approach not only challenges the reader but also gives them agency and authority to make decisions and take action.

  So there is an assertion at the beginning that creates attention and then a release of that attention that lands an idea. So the shortest blog post I ever wrote, which I'm really proud of is first line is you don't need more time. So that's an assertion. It's controversial. People who feel overwhelmed want to challenge it. And then the delivery is you just need to decide. So that flips it upside down, takes the blame off the system and the people who are making you busy and puts it right back on you, giving you agency and authority and responsibility to Simply decide and then get back to what needs to get done. And so in just a few words, that's an example of a short Seth Godin blog post and a longer one is one where I will try to teach somebody details about something they didn't know, but frame It in a way that they're comfortable with because that's how they might have framed it as well.
  Speaker 2
  Let me ask a quick question and maybe that I've cut back on my caffeine too significantly, but you don't need more time. You just need to decide what are people deciding? [Time 0:29:09](https://readwise.io/open/705815709)

- Maximizing Audience Satisfaction over Income and Audience Size
  Summary:
  The speaker acknowledges their success in podcasting, attributing it to their unique approach despite not considering themselves as particularly good at it.
  They emphasize the importance of creating a vacuum by stopping certain activities to focus on new endeavors. They reflect on the impact of technological changes on various media formats and highlight the significance of being a pioneer in new media spaces.
  Prioritizing the satisfaction of the people served by solving interesting problems is the speaker's main goal, rather than maximizing income per hour or audience size.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  I think it's very kind of you to say I'm very good at it. I don't think I'm good at it, but because I'm sort of in public and I do it in a certain way, it's noted. I did five years of a Kimbo was in the top 1% of all podcasts and then I just stopped and I stopped not because I didn't love it. I did love it. I stopped because if I kept doing it, there's something else I wouldn't do instead and creating a vacuum is required so that I will do the hard work of filling the vacuum. If I just keep doing the thing, then there is no vacuum. Sometimes the technology changes. That's why Spinnaker went away. That's why you couldn't keep making VCR games. It's why my head start in the CD-ROM business was worthless because CD-ROMs went away. I liked in every time I did this being a pioneer in a new media space because that's for me the funnest spot and then when the technology changes, I got to move on. Podcast technology is never going to change. You're noting there's a change in the production format and that is a change. In my case, what I'm trying to do is not maximize my income per hour spent nor am I trying to maximize the size of my audience. What I'm trying to maximize is are the people I'm serving glad that I did, that I showed up to solve an interesting problem. [Time 0:37:57](https://readwise.io/open/705816157)
