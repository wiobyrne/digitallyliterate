- The Evolution of Narratives in a Relationship
  Summary:
  A man's desire for frequent sex leads to resentment in his relationship.
  He feels entitled to fulfill his desires and believes his actions are not contributing to the distance in his marriage. After the birth of their daughter, the couple grows apart, and the man contemplates quitting his job or getting divorced.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  The story was different. The story had evolved out of in our relationship. I wanted to have sex more frequently than enmory did. And at some point it turned into like resentment that we're not having as much sex in our relationship as i want. And i'm a successful man, and successful men go out and they get what they want. And so i am entitled to this thing that i want, and i'm going to go out and get it because i deserved to. And that was the narrative i was telling myself in my head.
  Speaker 2
  When did that change?
  Speaker 1
  It changed about six months after our daughter was born, and i had disappeared on her. And then our daughter was born, which, if course, very, you know, is a big event in n any family. And we were just far apart at that point. And i could feel that at the time. I blamed it a lot on how much i was working, but that was senc the feeling, yes, the distance, and the feeling i i wasn't even yes, i was doing these bad things, but they couldn't be contributing To the distance, cause she doesn't know about them. I mean, that doesn't make any sense. Sounds ridiculous when i say it, but that's the narrative that was playing in my head. And so bout six months after our daughter was born, maybe seven months, we were so far apart i felt like i either need to quit my job or i'm goin to get divorced.

- Recognizing and Responding to Toxic Relationships
  Summary:
  Identifying and prioritizing healthy relationships is important.
  If someone consistently leaves you feeling bad after interacting with them, that's a signal from your body. It's crucial to listen to these signals and prioritize your well-being.
  By doing so, you can improve your overall performance and have a quieter mind.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  Now, let's take that last example, cause this is one that i people have tremendous difficulties do so, ok, they identify our relationship. That's not serving you any more. Let's, for the sake of argument, you say it's not your most significant otheres just says, not that. But you you identify friend x and hes likee, this as run its course. What do you do then?
  Speaker 1
  I think for me, that the signal is, there's a great quote from my angelo. I'm probably going to get it wrong, but it's something like this, people will forget what you say, they will forget what you do, but they'll never forget how you make them feel. And if there someone in your life, co worker, friend, family member, whatever, where every time you interact with that person, you kind of leave the interaction not feeling good. Yes, that's your body's intelligence. That's what when i say i want to embody my body more, i want to listen to those signals s because the more i've done that, by the way, the better i feel like i perform. And like a board meeting or with an autrepeneur, because i'm picking up on much subtler signals. Yet my mind is quieter, and i'm, i'm picking myself up.

  Many financial leaders aspire to be C-level executives.

  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Yes, so it's not a one sized fitzall thing, right? So different companies need different things. So the c f o of bowing is probably much different skill set than the ceo of papa. Or the c f o, i' sorry, c f o, c fo, the c c f o of of a company that's building airplanes or something elser is different than the skill set of someone in financial services, to some degree. So i have coached a lot of financial leaders, from managers up to sea level. And the way i explain this to them cons meet a lot of v ps in all different rolls, v p of marketing or v p of finus. And they all think they, well, they want to be the sea level. So i'm the v p of finance, i want to be the c f o. I'm the v p of marketing, i want to be the c m o. What separates the v p from the sea level, in my on the shorthand i give them, is that the c stands for confidence. [Time 2:05:41](https://readwise.io/open/601414689)
