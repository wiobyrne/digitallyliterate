  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  Hello, ladies and germs. This is Tim Ferriss. Welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss Show. I'm going to keep my preamble short because I would like to get into the meat and potatoes of this conversation that I've been looking forward to. My guest today is John Vervakey on Twitter. You can find him at vervakey underscore John. He is a professor of psychology and cognitive science at the University of Toronto. He currently teaches courses on thinking and reasoning with an emphasis on cognitive development, intelligence, rationality, mindfulness and the psychology of wisdom. Vervakey is the director of U Toronto's consciousness and wisdom studies laboratory and its cognitive science program where he teaches introduction to cognitive science and the Cognitive science of consciousness, emphasizing the cognitive science. Emphasizing the four E model, which I'm sure we will get into, which contends that cognition and consciousness are embodied, embedded, enacted and extended beyond the brain. Vervakey has taught courses on Buddhism and cognitive science in the Buddhism psychology and mental health program for 15 years. He is the author and presenter of the outstanding, that's what I'm adding, YouTube series. I highly recommend awakening from the meaning crisis and his brand new series after Socrates. You can find all things John Vervakey at Johnvervakey.com that is spelled V-E-R-V-A-E-K-E, Johnvervakey.com. John, thank you so much for taking the time today.
  Speaker 1
  Great pleasure to be here, Tim. Great pleasure indeed.
  Speaker 2
  Could you please elaborate on the four ways of knowing?
  Speaker 1
  So the idea about a taxonomy that has to be principled and so what it is is every one of these kinds of knowing has a particular vehicle, a particular result, a particular standard, a particular Kind of memory. [Time 0:04:12](https://readwise.io/open/543804586)
{ #rw543804586}


- Understanding Episodic Memory and Participatory Knowing
  Key takeaways:
  • Episodic memory is the memory of a person's perspective and state of mind in a particular situation.
  • Participatory knowing is a kind of knowing that results from how a person and reality have been co-shaped, generating affordances.
  • Affordances are available due to the co-shaping of a person and parts of the environment, making them niche and able to belong together.
  • This co-shaping is carried in a person's sense of self, which includes a very weird sense of memory that may not be recognized.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And what you'll do is you'll remember a particular perspective you had on a particular situation and your state of mind in that situation. That's your episodic memory. Now below that, and this gets to what we were talking about earlier, is participatory knowing this is knowing by being. This is the kind of knowing that results from how you and reality have been co-shaped to fit together to generate those affordances. So for example, the water bottle and I have both been shaped by gravity. We've both been shaped by electromagnetism so that we can, there's an affordance there. We've both been shaped by a biological history, which is niche construction. My ancestors evolved. They made tools that shape the environment that shaped my ancestors. Right? And culture has shaped me in this technology, made this, and taught me how to drink out of a water bottle. So there's been all this co-shaping of me and parts of the environment. So we fit together. We're niche together. We belong together. Affordances are available to me. And then that's carried in this very weird sense of memory that you probably don't even recognize. It's your sense of self. The sense of all of the identities you've taken up and how they're somehow historically, narratively linked together to certain narrative histories of certain situations. So here's the proposal. You have participatory knowing it's laying out affordances. And when that's missing, you know it. Culture shock. Or when you're homesick or when you're lonely.
  Speaker 2
  Could you just define affordances?
  Speaker 1
  The affordances are real relations for how you can interact with the object and how the object, how the object is available to you. [Time 0:08:43](https://readwise.io/open/543804587)
{ #rw543804587}


- Different Kinds of Knowing: Affordances, Perspectival, Situational, and Procedural Knowing
  Key takeaways:
  • Perspectival knowing makes certain affordances salient and brings them into situational awareness.
  • Situational awareness tells which skills to activate for procedural knowing.
  • Procedural knowing puts us into causal relationships with the world and provides evidence for our beliefs.
  • Other kinds of knowing are built on dynamic coupling to the environment and participation.
  • Interaction with the environment happens on different levels including the skin-encapsulated ego and mind-body connection.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Okay. So the affordances are here. And then the perspectival knowing makes certain affordances salient to me, grabbing my attention or rousing my metabolism. The floor is walkable for me right now, but I don't need to walk right now. So it's not something that I'm paying attention to, right? Yeah. But I bring it into my situational awareness with the perspectival knowing that situational awareness tells me which skills I should activate, which procedural knowing, and then The procedural knowing puts me into the causal relationships with the world that give me the evidence for my beliefs. So that's all the kinds of knowing. And the point is, outside of the propositional, these other kinds of knowing are built on the way you are coupled to the environment, dynamically coupled to the environment. And therefore they harken back to that participation, that contact we were talking about. Right.
  Speaker 2
  And I suppose it's this coupling and interaction with the environment on a few different levels in the sense that you have your sort of skin encapsulated ego. And it's interaction with what we perceive as external elements. And then you have perhaps those who think of mind and body in this Cartesian dualistic way. You have the interaction of the body with the mind, which in some respects is the entire reason for which the brain evolved in some respects. Let me just come back to semantic memory. Could you give just another example of semantic memory? Because I don't think I grasped that.
  Speaker 1
  Like if I ask you, are dogs fishes? And what do you say to me? I say no.
  Speaker 2
  That's semantic memory.
  Speaker 1
  Did anybody ever sit you down? Do you remember it? Do you have an episodic memory? I remember when I learned that dogs weren't fishes, right? [Time 0:11:41](https://readwise.io/open/543804588)

- Taoism is the Religion Philosophy of Flow
  Key takeaways:
  • The speaker practices Taoist practices such as Tai Chi Quan and Jan Zhang, which helps him achieve a flow state.
  • The speaker has been practicing Shiatsu therapy for ten years.
  • The speaker believes that the flow state achieved through Taoist practices is important and has a story of its impact on him in grad school.
  • The speaker's dedication to Tai Chi Quan caused fellow students to notice a change in him.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  So I've said this, and I mean this deeply, and I don't mean it as a trivial commodification. Taoism is the religion philosophy of flow. And I've been practicing Taoist practices, Tai Chi Quan, Jan Zhang, each one. She kung, I got professional training and practice for 10 years as a Shiatsu therapist. I've done it all, not at all. That's pretentious, but I've done a lot. That's fair. Right? And what those things do, and this is something I want to talk to you about at some point, they get me into a flow state, but in a particular way that I think is really important. And this goes to a story I've told. I was in grad school, and I'd been doing Tai Chi Quan for about three or four years. I was doing it really religiously, both in the sense of devotedly, and I was doing it like two or three hours a day, and going to the dojo three or four times a week, kind of thing. And some of my fellow students came up to me and said, well, what's going on with you? What are you doing differently? I think, oh, you're worried in grad school that people are going to find out. And so I said, I'm doing Tai Chi Quan, and I said, well, why are you saying that? And they said, well, because you're just more like in conversations, you're much more flowing, and you're much more flexible, and you're much more balanced, and you're much more receptive. And it was like, oh, oh, the flow state that I'm getting into in Tai Chi is permeating many different domains of my life and many different levels of my mind. And I thought, ah, and this is a question that has become a question to me. What are the contexts that generate flow that transfers like that powerfully? I'm glad you think it's a great question, because even if you get a good question, then you're a good scientist. [Time 0:16:15](https://readwise.io/open/543804589)

- The Importance of Frameworks and Metaphors in Skills Development
  Key takeaways:
  • The importance of finding a set of skills that has built-in potential for transferable skills.
  • The significance of having a philosophical framework that supports the situation.
  • Video game addiction can be a result of lack of flow potential and transferable skills in the external world.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And so if it does that, then it even shows up in the metaphors. We talk about balancing equations and justice being the balancing of things and scales. And so you want to find a set of skills that has that in built potential. And then what I would want to say is the degree to which there has been a framework built around the situation, a ritual philosophical framework that helps to afford the translation. So around the Tai Chi Quan, you have Taoism, which gives you this way of framing reality as yin and yang that you can see instantiated in the Tai Chi, but you can also see it prevalent in The world. You set up the possibility with this framework for the resonance. So people who get trapped, and I'm not saying that all video games trap people, but the ones that suffer from video game addiction, they get the problem that they flow in a world that is Not, does not have a framework around it does not tap into those. Generally transferable skills. And so they find the external world depressing because of its absence of flow potential that drives them into the game where they flow and then you get the vicious cycle that gets you Into the addiction. So I think there's something about are the kinds of skills that are being brought into the flow state. [Time 0:18:30](https://readwise.io/open/543804590)

- Enhancing the Flow State in Lectures Through Insight Cascade and Implicit Learning
  Key takeaways:
  • The flow state is not easily achieved in educational settings.
  • There are ways to enhance the flow state for both teachers and students.
  • The speaker has a biased theory on the flow state being an insight cascade and implicit learning enhancement.
  • The speaker prioritizes the emergence of insight and intuition while lecturing.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  Because you take this grab an example out of the year, Harvard Business School. They have these case study methods. And there is ostensibly supposed to be a fair amount of interplay between lecturer and student. But I would imagine that not all professors or grad students or whoever is doing the teaching at the time would say they achieve a flow state, even if they've experienced it in other places Like surfing. So what have you found to be things that enhance that for yourself and for the students?
  Speaker 1
  Part of this, I'm going to declare a bias because I have a published theory about what I think the flow state is. I think it's an insight cascade and the enhancement of implicit learning. So an enhance, we cultivate better insight capacities. We cultivate better intuition in an integrated manner. So I'm stating the bias up front, but I think it's a good theory and I think it's well argued and well evidenced. So what I mean by that is more and more I crafted giving priority to the emergence of insight or intuition in me as I was lecturing and not sticking to the script so strongly, but willing To bend. So I use the jazz analogy. I might have the script of the lecture, but I can riff on it and I look and I hunger and sensitize myself for that. [Time 0:24:35](https://readwise.io/open/543804591)
{ #rw543804591}


- The Flow State, Insight Cascades, and Cultivating Intuition
  Key takeaways:
  • The speaker has a bias towards the theory that flow state involves an insight cascade and enhancement of implicit learning.
  • The speaker prioritizes the emergence of insight or intuition in their lectures.
  • The speaker uses the jazz analogy to describe how they riff on their lectures and sensitize themselves to proto insight from their students.
  • The speaker encourages and draws out proto insight from their students, creating a cycle of priming each other for insights.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Part of this, I'm going to declare a bias because I have a published theory about what I think the flow state is. I think it's an insight cascade and the enhancement of implicit learning. So an enhance, we cultivate better insight capacities. We cultivate better intuition in an integrated manner.

So what I mean by that is more and more I crafted giving priority to the emergence of insight or intuition in me as I was lecturing and not sticking to the script so strongly, but willing To bend. So I use the jazz analogy. I might have the script of the lecture, but I can riff on it and I look and I hunger and sensitize myself for that. When the students start to even demonstrate sort of proto insight, I will really call that out. I mean in a positive manner and draw it out and they get, and they start priming each other with insights and they start priming me and I start priming them. It's an easy thing to state and it's a hard thing to do because when you're lecturing and when I teach people how to lecture, I actually try to say, I try to get them to make space for the jazz Because what you do when you're anxious. And one of the things that really kills it a lot is PowerPoint, right? Yeah, because what you want is I need to say all of these things and I need to be clear and I need to have this fall everything follow. [Time 0:25:08](https://readwise.io/open/543804592)

- Intuition vs. Logic in Problem Solving and Finding Meaning
  Key takeaways:
  • Intuition and logic are both important in problem solving and searching for meaning.
  • Logic is poorly suited for solving problems with combinatorially explosive search spaces.
  • Certainty requires searching through all or most of the search space.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  I wanted to invoke a word you mentioned in passing with respect to flow states in lectures, which was intuition. And so I wanted to loop that in to ask, well, we could pick and choose. This is interviewee's choice. So one would be, how do you think about intuition versus logic when it comes to problem solving or searching for meaning or finding meaning? Alternative question would be, what kinds of problems is logic poorly suited to solving?
  Speaker 1
  Yeah. We'll do that. And then I'll tell you what I think intuition is and what the powers and perils of it are. Great. So the search space, right? The search space for very, very many problems, like the chess example, is combinatorially explosive. It's computationally intractable. This is to the seminal work of Newell and Simon and Simon and his notion of bounded rationality. And this is the idea that you can't be comprehensively logical. Logic and math are algorithmic. They work in terms of certainty. Certainty requires that you search sometimes all or at least most of the space. [Time 0:41:53](https://readwise.io/open/543804593)
{ #rw543804593}


- The Challenge of Logic and Similarity in Conversation
  Key takeaways:
  • Cultivate virtues for logical thinking.
  • When to use logic is a harder problem.
  • Exhaustive search spaces can benefit from algorithms.
  • Trying to find invariant principles in conversations is difficult.
  • Similarity in conversations is hard to define logically, according to Nelson Goodman.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  You have to cultivate these virtues for when you use logic. So that's what rationality is. And that's a much harder problem. When should I be logical? And so you have to ask yourself, if I formulate the problem such that the search space could be searched in a relatively exhaustive fashion, and there are algorithms that work that how Many people are present in this conversation? There's an algorithm counting two one two we're done there that work. There was nothing wrong with doing that. Right? But if you try to say, I want to count all the numbers of possible conversations we could have, and thereby try to figure out invariant principles about through all conversations, it's
  Speaker 3
  Like, well, what's a conversation?
  Speaker 1
  And I've been in many ones and, you know, there's good ones and there's bad ones, but the good ones, they're sort of the same. They're similar to each other. And the problem with similarity, and this is now the main argument, is if you try to be logical about similarity, you're doomed.
  Speaker 2
  What do you mean by logical about similarity? This is an argument made by Nelson Goodman.
  Speaker 1
  What a great name for a philosopher. Nelson Goodman. Outstanding. 1972. And the argument goes like this. So identity is to share all properties. Similarity is to share a lot of properties, but not share all properties. [Time 0:43:20](https://readwise.io/open/543804594)

- Addressing Cognitive Bias through Active Open-Mindedness
  Key takeaways:
  • The speaker acknowledges falling prey to the issue being discussed.
  • The practice being discussed should transfer to multiple domains and engage non-propositional knowing.
  • It's important to practice active open-mindedness for a considerable amount of time.
  • Learning about biases and spotting them in other people can improve cognitive agility.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  I don't want to in any way try to convey that I don't fall prey to this. How have I tried to address it is how I'll frame the question you're in. Perfect. Okay. And so first of all, that issue that we were talking about earlier. How pervasively does your practice transfer to multiple domains and to multiple levels of your psyche? How much does it engage the non propositional kinds of knowing? How much is it engaging the ability to metacogatively shift between perspectives, etc. For exactly that reason. Secondly, it's not the questions you answer. It's practices you do at length for a considerable amount of time. I practice first of all, I practice it very explicitly for like two or three years. And you know, in this overlap significantly with stoicism, right? I practice active open mindedness. I'm a cognitive scientist learn about the biases. And this is how you get into it. Learn about the biases and first spot them in other people. You'll be astonishingly good at that. Oh, confirmation bias, my side bias, blah, blah, blah, blah. You're really good at fundamental attribution error. You're like, you're really good at it with other people, right? And get sort of like allow yourself to be sort of overconfident of it.

- Overview of Lexio Divina and Distinguishing between Meditation and Contemplation
  Key takeaways:
  • Lexio Divina is a practice variation on a philosophical fellowship.
  • Distinction between meditation and contemplation is crucial.
  • Frame situations by making salient, backgrounding, and ignoring objects.
  • The lens and the frame of one's glasses can be used as a metaphor of framing situations.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Lexio Divina. Am I getting that right? So practice is a variation on a called philosophical fellowship.
  Speaker 2
  Okay, perfect. So could you walk us through these and just give an example of an exercise, what that might look like in each of those? Sure.
  Speaker 1
  So, I mean, first of all, the distinction between meditation and contemplation. So I know this is audio only. So I wear glasses.
  Speaker 2
  And so I'm. And we'll probably also use the video, but just for those people who only have the audio, it's always helpful to write to tell them what's going on.
  Speaker 1
  Yes. You know, I've been talking throughout about how you frame situations, what you make salient, what you background and what you ignore. So think about that, like the lens and the frame of my glasses, right? And I'm not aware of my lenses or my frame because I'm aware through them, beyond them and by means of them. So they're transparent to me. Now sometimes, and what I'm doing right now, I'm taking my glasses off because there might be something on my lenses. And now they're not transparent to me. I'm not looking through them. I'm looking at them. That's what meditation is. It's about trying to become aware, step back and look at your mental framing. So what you do is, for example, you try to get people to look at something they're normally looking through, like their sensations. [Time 1:00:02](https://readwise.io/open/543804596)

- Understanding the Concept of Non-Thingness in Ultimate Reality
  Key takeaways:
  • Non-theists reject presuppositions about ultimate reality as a being.
  • Being is a no-thingness in which all things come to be.
  • Being is not a thing, but a profound relationship can be formed with it.
  • Non-thingness metaphors, like water, are used to convey the concept of being.
  • The speaker uses an analogy of a partner to convey the transcendent nature of being.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And the non-theist says I reject all of those presuppositions. I don't think of ultimate reality as a thing. I don't think of it as a being. I think of it as the ground of being and being is a no-thingness. It is not a thing. It is that in which all things come to be. Being isn't a being. This isn't something you can just get to. It's very Taoist. It's very Taoist. The Tao that can be spoken of is not the Tao, right? And the naming is the myriad way. And the emptiness of the cup is what makes the cup function. All of these non-thingness metaphors, it's like water, they're all trying to get you to understand that being the really real isn't a thing. It's a no-thingness, which is not the same thing as nothingness. And that we can enter into a profound relationship with that no-thingness. Let me give you an analogy. I love my partner. She's an amazing woman and I'm fortunate to be with her. I do not think I will ever completely grasp or understand her because there is something about her that always is transcending herself and transcending my understanding of her. There is something in that sense properly mysterious about her. Any frame I put around her, she shines into it, but she also withdraws from it further into the mystery that she is.

- Translation Challenges and Impressions of a New Collection of Rumi Poetry
  Key takeaways:
  • Halalisa Geforri's knowledge of the Persian language enriches her translations of Rumi poetry.
  • Translating poetry is a formidable task, especially for non-native speakers or those translating from other translations.
  • The challenges of translation include choosing the cadence and matching alliteration.
  • The book of Rumi poetry being discussed impressed the speaker.
  • The conversation continues and the speaker is open to more questions.
  • The importance of the upcoming topic (4E) is mentioned.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  All right, fantastic. Thank you. And you know, funny enough, I was listening to Coltrane jazz before this conversation, which maybe was a good warmup for the conversation. And I have a new collection of translations. I want to get the name of the author correct. So it is a new translation of roomy poetry. Oh, yes. And it is by, I'm not going to pronounce this correctly, but Halalisa Geforri. And as a Persian or Persian American, I mean, her knowledge of the language so enriches how she is able to convey passages that could be real stumbling blocks for anyone who is basing Their translation off of another translation or who is a non native speaker. It's very hard to translate period, but it's even harder to translate poetry. It's like, do you choose the cadence? Do you choose to try to match the alliteration or what the equivalent of alliteration would be? It's such a formidable task. I was very impressed by the book. I would be remiss if I didn't ask you if you're open to a few more questions.
  Speaker 1
  I'm fine. I'm enjoying this.
  Speaker 2
  Let's keep going. Wonderful. 4E, I think this is important for us to discuss. What are the 4Es?
  Speaker 1
  So I think we should have 6Es, but I'll tell you what the standard 4Es are. And then the bonus too. I'm into it. So this is the idea that cognition is inherently embodied, firstly, embedded coupled to the environment, secondly, enacted. [Time 1:36:29](https://readwise.io/open/543804598)
{ #rw543804598}


- The 4Es of Cognition and the Extended Mind
  Key takeaways:
  • Cognition is inherently embodied, embedded coupled to the environment, enacted.
  • Cognition is something that is done, not something that is had.
  • Most of our cognition is not done inside of us, but through the world including other people.
  • Problem solving is done in an extended way with the world.
  • Ed Hutchins' Cognition in the Wild discusses extended cognition.
  • Navigation of a ship is not done by one person alone.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  So I think we should have 6Es, but I'll tell you what the standard 4Es are. And then the bonus too. I'm into it. So this is the idea that cognition is inherently embodied, firstly, embedded coupled to the environment, secondly, enacted. Cognition is something that you are doing. It's not something you have. It's between you and the world, not within you. And then extended. Most of our cognition is not done inside of us. It's done through the world. This includes other people. So for example, you and I are having a conversation right now. We're solving a problem. And this is depending on people building computers, setting up the internet, setting up Zoom or Riverside. Neither one of us invented the English language, etc. And all of these things and even literacy. Literacy is not natural, but we internalize it, but it allows us to link our cognition in profound ways. And so most of our problem solving is done in an extended way. I guess the classic book by this is Cognition in the Wild by Ed Hutchins. We talk about the fact that nobody, no person, navigates a ship. There's a whole bunch of different people doing different roles and a whole bunch of equipment and they form a dynamical system that is actually responsible for navigating the ship. Myself and one of my dear friends and great co-authors, Dan Chiappie, we've published three papers on NASA scientists moving the rovers around on Mars. And how do they form this distributed cognition, especially with that huge time gap, right? The time delay. And how do they make it work? And how does that distributed cognition work? Because they get very powerful sense of an emergent kind of we agency that's above and beyond just adding the part. [Time 1:37:46](https://readwise.io/open/543804599)

- Understanding Distributed Cognition and Embodied Mind
  Key takeaways:
  • A dynamical system of people and equipment is responsible for navigating the ship.
  • NASA scientists form a distributed cognition to move rovers on Mars.
  • Distributed cognition creates a powerful sense of emergent agency.
  • Embodied cognition means the mind and body are not separate but different aspects of a person.
  • Attention focus is not just cold calculation, but also involves the body.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  There's a whole bunch of different people doing different roles and a whole bunch of equipment and they form a dynamical system that is actually responsible for navigating the ship. Myself and one of my dear friends and great co-authors, Dan Chiappie, we've published three papers on NASA scientists moving the rovers around on Mars. And how do they form this distributed cognition, especially with that huge time gap, right? The time delay. And how do they make it work? And how does that distributed cognition work? Because they get very powerful sense of an emergent kind of we agency that's above and beyond just adding the part. So that's the extended. So embodied. Embodied means, like I said, you don't have a body. You are a body and your mind and your body are not separate things. They're different aspects of what you are. People may say, what do you mean by that? What do I mean by that? Well, remember I said earlier, you have this problem you're facing, which is what do I pay attention to? What do I focus my attention to? What do I ignore? And this is not cold calculation. It's also your affect. It means what do you care about and what do you not care about? Reed Montague, the neuroscientist, put it really well. He said, the difference between us and computers is we care about information and they don't. Right? And that's our great strength and our great weakness. Now, the thing is, why do you care about information? [Time 1:38:55](https://readwise.io/open/543804600)

- The Difficulty of Experiencing Consciousness as Just a Brain in a Jar
  Key takeaways:
  • Steve Gerbertson, a technical investor, discussed in a Facebook post the difficulty of experiencing anything as a human if we were just brains in a jar.
  • Without our appendages and our organism, our experience of consciousness would not be possible.
  • Having this experience of consciousness is very precious.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  You know, this is very ineptly what I was trying to convey very early in the conversation. Predominantly, and I encourage people to find this. It's not going to be immediately coming to the tip of my tongue. But Steve Gerbertson, who's very technical investor, I think he did. Electrical engineering and mechanical engineering degree in three years at Stanford or something like that. I'm probably getting some of the specifics wrong, but he's been on the podcast before. And he had this very long Facebook post discussing why it would be difficult, if not impossible, to experience anything as a human if we were just brains in a jar.
  Speaker 1
  Yes. Brain in a fat problem, yes.
  Speaker 2
  Yeah, brain in a fat problem. And I found it very compelling and sort of embarrassing that it wasn't self-evident to me right off the bat. It's like without these appendages and this multifaceted organism to interface with an environment, what we experience as consciousness doesn't seem at least offhand to me possible, Which makes it very precious that we have this experience.

- Exploring the Hard Problem of Consciousness and Functionality
  Summary:
  It's a hard problem because it doesn't seem to be any way of explaining their nature. But I think if you get into and this is work I'm doing with a whole bunch of other people, I think you can give an integrated answer. So the converging thing is that what consciousness is for and it overlaps with attention and working memory and fluid intelligence. Think about when you're driving on the highway... When do you come back to it? If there's something unexpected happens or there's a really complex situation suddenly emerging ... That's what you need consciousness for.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And even a person who's colorblind, right? Has it been qualia or as Thomas Nagle famously argued, bats who use echolocation have qualia that we don't have. Okay. So that's what that means. It's a hard problem because it doesn't seem to be any way of explaining their nature. But I think if you get into and this is work I'm doing with a whole bunch of other people. So I don't want to take soil credit. But I think if you make use of functionality and you make use of the four kinds of knowing and things like this, I think you can give an integrated answer. There is a consensus emerging and I've published on this and talked about this around what consciousness does. What's it for? And then I think once you get that and you open up that functionality, you actually get a phenomenology. You get an explanation of the experience out of that. So the converging thing is that what consciousness is for and it overlaps with attention and working memory and fluid intelligence. Think about when you're driving on the highway. When do you come back to it? If there's something unexpected happens or there's a really complex situation suddenly emerging or there's an ill-defined problem that you're not quite sure how to formulate in Frame, that's what you need consciousness for. So what is consciousness? It's this higher order relevance realization. It's about re-realizing what's relevant and important so that you can deal with the added challenge of zeroing in on relevant information that is given to you by novelty, complexity And ill-defined-iveness. That's what consciousness for it. It's this enhanced relevance realization. That's why it overlaps with working memory and things like that.
  Speaker 2
  Now that does sound like a consciousness that would extend to animals other than humans.

- Binary Thinking and Additivity in Intelligence
  Key takeaways:
  • The podcast guest discussed the binary thinking prevalent in society.
  • They mentioned the issue of identity politics and its impact on civil debate.
  • The importance of adding to each other's arguments was highlighted.
  • The concept of relevance realization, with a focus on attentional systems, was introduced.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  Yeah, I had Jordan on this podcast and it was incredible to see how strongly binary, not just the responses.
  Speaker 1
  The wrongs and gone.
  Speaker 2
  Yeah. But also the expectations of me were all in, are you all in or are you all out? And there was part of me that wanted to say, this is the kind of identity politics morass that we have as such an issue to have any kind of reconciliation and civil debate. It can't be, well, I'm making a strong statement, but it shouldn't be, shouldn't have to be that black or white. I think there are many areas.
  Speaker 1
  I want to strengthen your argument for you. I want to strengthen your argument.
  Speaker 2
  Please, I need someone to do this with me more regularly.
  Speaker 1
  This has to do with additivity. This has to do with intelligence. Let's just give you an example of relevance realization right now, right here, right now. You have two attentional systems, probably more, but at least these two. [Time 2:10:28](https://readwise.io/open/552837670)

- The Opponent Processing Concept and its Relevance in Democracy
  Key takeaways:
  • The concept of relevance realization is an important aspect of intelligence.
  • The mind has two attentional systems - task focus and default mode network.
  • Task focus helps in keeping one's attention on the task at hand while the default mode network is responsible for mind-wandering and introducing variation.
  • Opponent processing is a common feature of adaptive systems such as the autonomic nervous system and democracy.
  • Opponent processing can be a helpful tool for correcting bias and improving democracy.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  This has to do with additivity. This has to do with intelligence. Let's just give you an example of relevance realization right now, right here, right now. You have two attentional systems, probably more, but at least these two. You have the task focus that is trying to keep you focused on what is John saying with his multisyllabic, complex sentences. And then there's a part of you, the default mode network that's mind wandering and I'm not accusing you of anything. It's drifting away. It's thinking about other things. They're locked together like evolution. The mind wandering introduces variation. The tax network kills most of it off, but some of it survives and helps reproduce the conversation and keep it going. Opponent processing, your autonomic nervous system about arousal, sympathetic is biased to arousing you. Parasympathetic is biased to getting you to calm down and they're locked together in opponent processing. You find this all through adaptive systems, opponent processing. Democracy, I argued this when I gave a talk in the International Symposium on Democracy and Prague in September, right? Democracy should be opponent processing. The best way for me to correct my perspective of bias is to have you be in opponent processing with me. You take a different bias, but we agree that we are each other's best means of self correction. That's how democracy should work. [Time 2:11:12](https://readwise.io/open/552837840)

- Reasons for creating "After Socrates" podcast series
  Key takeaways:
  • After Socrates was created in response to criticisms of the Meaning Crisis series, which was criticized for not providing actionable advice and being overly individualistic.
  • After Socrates aims to trace the entire philosophical tradition from Socrates and offers a pedagogical program based on reverse engineering the dialectic and dealing with logos.
  • Each episode includes an argument that builds on previous ones and points of reflection for listeners to engage with.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  I was meaning and I will now ask about after Socrates. You have this very popular YouTube series Awakening from the Meaning Crisis. Why create after Socrates?
  Speaker 1
  I listened to the criticism of other people. Coming from the Meaning Crisis has a couple of main criticisms that people made. One was a lot of people asked at the end, yeah, but what do I do now? What do I do now? You've convinced me about the Meaning Crisis and this problem and blah, blah, blah, and how do I do now? Then secondly, you did this totally individualistically. How does this work with other people? After Socrates is not extensive, it's intensive. It's trying to trace the entire tradition from Socrates. Doing a lot of time there about all of these kinds of reverse engineer. I'm not claiming this is exactly what Socrates did. Who could claim that? I'm trying to reverse engineer as best I can, this dialectic and to deal logos, these kinds of practices we've been talking about so that people can undertake a pedagogical program. Every episode is I give an argument and they build on each other like Awakening from the Meaning Crisis, but I also get points of reflection that are designed to [Time 2:17:50](https://readwise.io/open/552839162)

- Language and Cultural Cognitive Grammar
  Key takeaways:
  • The podcast host thanks the guest for being a great jazz player.
  • The show notes will be available at Tim.blog/slashpodcast.
  • The speaker advises listeners to be kind and practice what they believe in.
  • The guest and host discuss the power of language and words.
  • Words can shape our thinking and cultural understanding.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  Oh, thank you, John. Thank you for being such a great jazz player on the stage. And I really, really enjoyed it. I took tons of notes. So I have quite a lot of reading and investigating and practicing ahead of me. And to everybody listening as per usual, we all have links to everything. I may need to do some work on my spelling of various names, but we'll figure it out in the show notes at Tim.blog slash podcast. And until next time, please be just a bit kinder than is necessary. That includes to yourself, but certainly to other people. And remember, it's not just what you believe. It is what you practice. So get to practicing folks. And as always, thanks for tuning in. And I thought we would start with a sandbox that I like to play in. And I think you are a black belt where I am still a middling white belt. And that is a discussion of language and words. And specifically, I was hoping you could perhaps give us some examples of words that we use commonly that frame the way we think about life or relate to life in the West, if that is perhaps A container that works for the question.
  Speaker 1
  Yeah, I think it's a good container. I think there are words that are signpost benchmarks for a kind of cultural cognitive grammar, giving us some sort of our basic conceptual vocabulary. [Time 2:20:53](https://readwise.io/open/552840157)

- Critiquing the Cartesian framework and redefining terms like subjective and objective
  Key takeaways:
  • There have been critiques of the Cartesian framework for the last 200 years.
  • The subjective and objective dichotomy has insinuated itself into the way we see the world.
  • The speaker's work is to try to undermine that dichotomy and find something deeper that makes them related.
  • Without something deeper, we risk radical skepticism and solipsism.
  • The meaning of the word 'matter' has changed over time.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And there's been critiques of that framework, which we got from the Cartesian framework for the last 200 years, even in the history of Western philosophy. So the fact that we have these terms, we bandy them about, we think that that's all there is. It's complete and exhaustive and they're divided and they're really radically incommensurable with each other. It just shows how well this has insinuated itself into the very way we see ourselves, see the world, experience ourselves. And it's very powerful and very interesting. And part of my work is to try to undermine that dichotomy and try and get us to think more profoundly about that there must be something deeper than the subjective and objective that fundamentally Makes it possible for them to be related together. Because if not, we are really doomed in a kind of radical skepticism and solipsism. Solipsism is the idea that you, the only thing that's really real is your own mind kind of thing. So that would be one clear example. Another one along those lines that we haven't paid attention to, how much it's changed, is the word matter, we now take matter as actual stuff. But if you go before the scientific revolution matter in the Aristotelian framework means exactly the opposite. It means pure potentiality that which is a waiting to be informed and actualized.

- How Studying Cognitive Science and Philosophy Changes Our Relating to Life's Experience
  Key takeaways:
  • The term 'transjective' was coined to describe the binding of inner and outer experience.
  • The idea of 'affordances' can help explain certain experiences.
  • Studying cognitive science and philosophy has changed the speaker's relationship to their experience.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  How has your relating to, and I apologize if the wording on this is clumsy, but your relating to your experienced reality changed as you've studied cognitive science and philosophy And these different labels and frameworks that despite our perhaps underlying subconscious belief that it has always been this way in the case of say subjective objective. How has your own relating to life's experience changed?
  Speaker 1
  I coined a term the transjective to mean that which binds the two together. That which binds the inner life of the organism to the outer world of the environment kind of thing. And there I was influenced by a teacher of mine, John Kennedy who was a protege of JJ Gibson. Let me give you an example. I've become aware of things. So Gibson had a notion of an affordance. So this water bottle is graspable. Now the graspability isn't in my hand. [Time 2:25:11](https://readwise.io/open/552840679)

- On Contact Epistemology, Neoplatonic Traditions, and Cutting-Edge Cognitive Science
  Key takeaways:
  • The maker has the structural functional organization in their head.
  • Contact epistemology involves mutual participation and connectedness.
  • The neoplatonic tradition is the spiritual grammar of the West.
  • Cutting edge cog sci argues that the mind is between the embodied brain and the world.
  • There are 4 kinds of knowing, with 3 involving connectedness and mutual participation.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Oh sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry everybody. Yeah. So right. So yeah. Thanks for that. So who actually knows this better? Somebody who could describe it or somebody who could make it? Well you generally people say well somebody who could actually make it, who could actually bring about the structural functional organization. So what does the maker have in their head? Well they have the structural functional organization and they just have to put it into that. So the thing that makes this act the way it does is identical to something in your mind and you're both sharing in that. So this is called a contact epistemology. You're mutually participating and so the relatedness and the connectedness is more primordial. And that's sort of an idea running through the whole neoplatonic tradition which I would argue following Arthur vs. Lewis is really the spiritual grammar of the West is the neoplatonic tradition. So in that sense it's old. In another sense it's very new because what's coming out of 4e cognitive science is exactly this kind of thing. And this has to do with ways of knowing. I talk about because of the work I do in 4e cog sigh, 4 kinds of knowing. Maybe we can get into that. But the point is that 3 of those 4 kinds of knowing are about this kind of connectedness and mutual participation. And I find it's very interesting. The sort of cutting edge cog sigh is arguing that this is even to use the metaphor. Your mind is not in your head. It's between your embodied brain and the world. That's where the mind is and that's how you should think of the mind. That's really cutting edge and important and there's a lot of important work being done about it. But in a lot of ways it hearkens back to that ancient neoplatonic tradition. [Time 2:29:57](https://readwise.io/open/552841253)
