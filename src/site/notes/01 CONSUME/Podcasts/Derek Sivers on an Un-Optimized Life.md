## Highlights
- The Night I Thought I Had a Panic Attack
  Key takeaways:
  • The speaker had a panic attack which they were not familiar with.
  • They previously had no respect for people who experienced panic attacks.
  • The speaker was unsure if they had become a 'panic attack person'
  • The speaker went to sleep without any answers.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  So I, where the hell is the boyfriend? I don't know. You take her away. So I was, so you're on your own day, but I'm out of here.
  Speaker 1
  I've accidentally missed one step in the storytelling of this that I should have included is the night in between those two days. I went home that night thinking, what the fuck? I think I just had a panic attack. I'm not one of those people. I have no respect for people who have panic attacks because usually panic attacks to me. I think of like people who are just like, oh no, like my cake is late. I'm going to die. And they freak out over shallow little things. And it seems to me like they have no perspective on life. So then I have no respect for that kind of silly panic, but I had just panicked. And it was involuntary. It's like that night. I had this moment. She's like, wow, what does that mean? Am I a panic attack person now? Have I changed categories from a not panic attack person to a panic attack person? I just kind of fell asleep with no answers to that. So then yeah, then the next day, had this thing happen with a German couple. And I feel like that experience taught me two kinds of empathy that we categorize people, like I just said, the type of person who has a panic attack. And we think of a category of person that's say like depressed, fat, homeless, divorced, bankrupt. [Time 0:16:05](https://readwise.io/open/543804539)

- The Danger of Labels and Identity in Stoicism
  Key takeaways:
  • Being labeled as something can be limiting and should be dealt with carefully.
  • One's circumstances can change suddenly and cause emotional distress.
  • The speakers have a tendency to go on tangents in their conversations.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  Because you are susceptible to the whim of chance in a way that I think is not particularly resilient. If suddenly your circumstance is changed and you find yourself in a different category, it can be really upsetting. And how do you think about what you call or don't call yourself? We're talking a little bit about this at lunch before we recorded, right? There are people who are like, I have heard stoicism, now I am a stoic. And there's this identity that's assumed and these labels that are applied. And as much as I love stoicism, even though I invoke that name, I do think that you have to be careful with labels. So how do you think about that for yourself? Well timed for a sopascotch.
  Speaker 1
  Well, you're amazing. Sit down. Sit down. By the way, the hardest thing about hitting record on this is that Tim and I have these crazy all over the place conversations in a forest and whatnot that it's hard to remember that we Need to close tangents today. Yeah, that's true. Usually we open a tangent and close it two days later. Yep, that's very true. We need to close tangents today. Okay. So do you want me to go on my anti-ism tangent?
  Speaker 2
  Well, let's see. Is there some unfinished business that we need to tidy up first?
  Speaker 1
  There's a tiny idea around the identity, which is to just admit that whatever you are is now, and whatever your preference is now. So like when my kid says, I hate tomatoes, I say today, and he goes, oh, right, I hate tomatoes today, because it's leaving open the possibility that you might change your mind tomorrow.

- Tech Independence: The Main Sales Pitch of the Cloud
  Key takeaways:
  • Tech independence means not relying on cloud services to keep your data safe.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 3
  All right. So Dr.
  Speaker 2
  Sivers, please hold court.
  Speaker 1
  So audience, I prepared. I took notes because although I love Tim's podcast, I love it most when people come and give us like an intense day to dump. Yeah. Know this. Yeah. So, all right guys, I prepared a couple hours. And here you go. So I'm going to unapologetically read from my notes to give you the best bang for buck of your time listening. So tech independence is all about the fact that I think the main sales pitch of the cloud is now, don't worry your little head about that. Let us take care of it. We'll keep all of your data.

- Setting Up Your Own Server: A Simple Guide
  Key takeaways:
  • Getting your own server is simple and can cost as low as $5 per month.
  • Vulture.com offers Cloud Compute for $5 a month.
  • A server is just a computer that is always online and can be publicly or privately accessible.
  • There are three options for setting up a server: a $5 per month Cloud Compute plan, searching the web for a cheap, dedicated server, or getting a dedicated server which is a physical piece of hardware for personal use.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  So first, let me just say, the first thing you need is to get your own server, which is as simple as $5 a month. If you go to, there's a company I recommend called vulture.com, but it's spelled ph-u-l-t-r- dot com.
  Speaker 2
  I could use some branding help, but yeah.
  Speaker 1
  So they have something called Cloud Compute for $5 a month. Where basically that's setting up a private slice that's just yours, but on a shared computer.
  Speaker 2
  Okay, so it's like a virtual private server. Virtual private server, exactly. It was trying to not get technical. Yeah. And a server for people who don't know, I know this is going to be old news for a lot of folks. What is a server? Sounds super complicated.
  Speaker 1
  It's not. It's just a computer that's always online. That's it. Publicly accessible, always online. Doesn't even necessarily need to be public. We'll get to that. Because I think for setting up your server, there are three options. Either the $5 a month, vulture.com, cloud compute. Number two, search the web for a cheap, dedicated server. So now a dedicated server is an actual piece of hardware that is only yours, not shared with anybody else. So if you want more privacy, just spend a little extra money and get a dedicated server. Which means yeah, this physical hardware, you're the only person that has. They have physical access to it, but you have the only root password. And it's going to be an encrypted hard drive. We'll get to that. [Time 0:36:28](https://readwise.io/open/543804542)

- Maximizers vs Satisficers
  Key takeaways:
  • Maximizers feel worse about decisions they make compared to satisficers who feel much better about their choices.
  • Satisficing can shape a person's decision making and life choices.
  • Optimizing, as discussed in the podcast passage, refers to being a maximizer.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  I had no idea you're going to bring this up. This is great. Yeah. Yeah.
  Speaker 1
  That maximizers have been found to feel worse about the decisions they make. They look into every possible option. They try to make the best possible choice, but studies show that they feel worse about the choice they make, whereas satisficers may not make the absolute best possible choice, but They feel much better about the choices they make. Yeah. I think a lot of who I am is because of satisficing. And if I seem like I make weird decisions in life, for example, like not even continuing to pursue making money, it's because I'm satisficing. Like I really took that lesson to heart and have shaped my life around it.
  Speaker 2
  So just for definition terms, right? Because people might think optimizing is trying to eat out the every last Iota of improvement, right? But I think what we're really talking about is... Wait, start it in a rep. You know what? [Time 1:10:25](https://readwise.io/open/543804543)
{ #rw543804543}


- The Unoptimized Life and Making Fast, Reversible Decisions
  Key takeaways:
  • The speaker is discussing their approach to decision-making and how they focus on making fast, easily reversible decisions.
  • They mention the importance of being done with something in order to move on and avoid open loops.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  I haven't had a shower since yesterday. It was feeling greasy. It's distracting. But no, it's funny.
  Speaker 2
  I wasn't sure if you were going to say, so as you were saying yesterday in the forest about sex. Oh, no, no, no, no. We'll leave that aside for Scott outside of recording. The unoptimized life. What effect has that had on you paying more attention to that? Leaving good enough alone. Because this is something I would like to do more of. And I've tried to focus with some success on making fast, especially reversible or trivial decisions. Right. If it can be undone easily, this is also with money, right? Attention and money. I'm going to default to speed with a lot of things. If it's not that important or if it's pretty easy to reverse. And I think that's been helpful.
  Speaker 1
  I'll have to top my head. I think how important it is to be done with something so that you can move on. Like I don't want open loops. [Time 1:14:49](https://readwise.io/open/543804544)

- The Power of Skepticism in Life: A Conversation About Useful, Not True with Professor Servers on Mics
  Key takeaways:
  • The speaker thinks about the quality of their work before release.
  • The concept of 'useful, not true' is discussed.
  • The speaker considers the audience when sharing their most important takeaway.
  • Skepticism has been a superpower for the speaker in the last seven years.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  So I think about that with anything I post on my site, any of my books, it's like, all right, it's released. It's good enough.
  Speaker 2
  All right. I'm going to combine this. There may be another. It's not really a serverism, but in terms of how Professor Servers operates in the world, useful, not true. We've been talking a bit about this. I wanted to save a lot of it for this conversation about the mics. Where should we start with this? All right.
  Speaker 1
  So again, I'm addressing the audience for a second. So, you know, I figure I'm coming on the podcast. This isn't just one of our random conversations. Yeah. This is for the audience. There's a reason we're hitting record. It's for them. Yeah. We can talk freely without hitting record. So I had to think, what's the most useful thing I could share with your audience that I've learned like in the last seven years since we last spoke? The thing that's made a biggest difference in my life, a superpower, a big, huge change. So to me, it's been, in short, skepticism. So if you wonder why I'm so happy, why I'm thriving, why I seem to be doing well, to me, it's a lot of my happiness comes from this worldview that is radical doubt. It's skepticism. And so I'm going to give this the shorthand of calling it useful, not true. But the visual for it is that moment at the end of the matrix movie, when Neo realizes like, those aren't bullets. [Time 1:16:31](https://readwise.io/open/543804545)
{ #rw543804545}


- The Power of Skepticism: A Superpower for a Happier Life
  Key takeaways:
  • The speaker believes that skepticism has been the most useful thing in his life.
  • The speaker considers skepticism to be a worldview of radical doubt.
  • The speaker believes that his happiness comes from skepticism.
  • The speaker uses the movie The Matrix to illustrate how skepticism can change one's worldview.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  So again, I'm addressing the audience for a second. So, you know, I figure I'm coming on the podcast. This isn't just one of our random conversations. Yeah. This is for the audience. There's a reason we're hitting record. It's for them. Yeah. We can talk freely without hitting record. So I had to think, what's the most useful thing I could share with your audience that I've learned like in the last seven years since we last spoke? The thing that's made a biggest difference in my life, a superpower, a big, huge change. So to me, it's been, in short, skepticism. So if you wonder why I'm so happy, why I'm thriving, why I seem to be doing well, to me, it's a lot of my happiness comes from this worldview that is radical doubt. It's skepticism. And so I'm going to give this the shorthand of calling it useful, not true. But the visual for it is that moment at the end of the matrix movie, when Neo realizes like, those aren't bullets. This is just code. Remember all the bullets come away? It's like, oh, wait, right. Like none of these rules apply to me. That's deep skepticism. It's empowering. It's liberating. So what I'm going to do for a few minutes, including a little stories, is to play Morpheus, to help emancipate the listeners. So yes, I call this useful, not true, but it goes, yeah, there we go. Number one. So it's okay. I'm going to tell you the four bits first, and we'll use that to kind of make sure that we come back to this. So number one, almost nothing is objectively true. Number two, beliefs are placebos. So you've got to believe whatever works for you now. [Time 1:16:58](https://readwise.io/open/543804546)
{ #rw543804546}


- The Liberating Power of Choosing Your Own Beliefs
  Key takeaways:
  • Beliefs are not necessarily true, so choose what works for you now.
  • Personal empowerment comes from choosing beliefs that help you be who you want to be.
  • Rules and norms are arbitrary games and can be challenged and changed.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  So, Since no beliefs are true, I think this is liberating To realize that you can just Choose whatever belief Works for you now. That helps you be who you want to be. This is like, This is about personal empowerment. It's a little bit hacking yourself. If a certain belief will help you be Who you want to be. Right now, You don't need to keep believing it Tomorrow. You could believe it for three minutes Or three days or, You know, The rest of your life. You're going to find what you look for. So if you choose to believe something, You'll find evidence to support your belief. Of anything. So, The number three is that Rules and norms are arbitrary games. So this is the one where I can't help but think of You know, Your introduction to the world And for our work week. Giving so many wonderful examples Of how you don't have to accept The world's norms. Yep, for sure. But it's funny how many Times the rules of the world are stated As if they're absolutely true. Like all applicants Must submit their application Through the usual channels And wait to hear from us. Or to be an expert in your field, You should have an advanced degree From a university. But someone made up these rules And most people follow those rules. But they're not true. They're just not absolutely true. So I think that realizing They're not true gives you an incredible advantage Because you realize you can make up the rules. So this is that matrix moment Where the bullets are flying out And it goes, wait a minute. This is just Code. Yeah. Somebody made this up But I don't need to run this program. But if you do that, People are going to be upset at you. So somebody's going to get mad at you. And you have to know That even when they say You're a bad person for doing this, You have to know that that's not true either.
  Speaker 2
  And I have a good story about that. This, I think begs the number of Questions living in a broader society About morally acceptable Or reprehensible behavior. [Time 1:24:32](https://readwise.io/open/543804547)
{ #rw543804547}


- Avoiding Moral Relativism in Different Cultures
  Key takeaways:
  • The speaker agrees with the idea that individuals can choose their own moral values.
  • The speaker questions how to avoid moral relativism and perceiving everything as acceptable.
  • The speaker references Sam Harris' ideas on the moral landscape.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  You can choose your own. So there's a lot of this that I agree with. I also wonder how we avoid. Maybe we don't. But sinking into a moral relativism where everything is okay. On some level because nothing is objectively good or bad. Therefore, general mutilation of like 12 year old girls or whatever it is is totally fine in that culture because the culture is different. Therefore, I'm not going to object to anything like that. Because I'm not the arbiter of universal truth. Therefore, like everything is okay in different cultures, different places, different households, because everything is relative.
  Speaker 1
  How do you think about that? I defer to Sam Harris. Okay. Did he ever talk about the moral landscape on your show?
  Speaker 2
  I don't think we've discussed it explicitly. So why don't you face it if you wouldn't mind elaborating?
  Speaker 1
  Probably the best elaboration is to help people to go search for Sam Harris' moral landscape. The best TED talk I've ever seen. That is the one. Sam Harris' moral landscape so beautifully summarizes [Time 1:32:54](https://readwise.io/open/543804548)

- The Problem with All or Nothing Mindset in Criticizing
  Key takeaways:
  • The speaker criticizes someone for declaring an entire book to be trash based on one thing they didn't like.
  • The problem with isms is that they often operate as all or nothing systems.
  • If a leader of a movement says something a person doesn't like, it can lead to the whole movement being deemed ruined.
  • This mindset is akin to finding a fly in one's dish or a poo in the pool and draining the whole thing, which is an extreme reaction.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And this guy is full of himself. This book is trash. And I think about that all the time because- This is like, is he a German guy?
  Speaker 2
  No, I don't know. I think, I think, yeah, and I've heard a bit of this before. Yeah, right.
  Speaker 1
  So it's like, because he found one thing- Not slightly fine German, I should say. Outside of the US, Germany and Korea. My best is- But he found one thing he didn't like about you. Therefore, declared all 400 pages of this book to be trash. And I think that's the problem with isms. Is it if you're trying to buy- All or nothing. A system, yeah, it's only nothing. And so if the leader of a movement says something you don't like on social media, well, now the bubbles popped. It's a fly in my dish. It's a hair in the meal. It's a poo in the pool. The whole thing is ruined. Drain the pool. I think that's page four to seven in your doctor's seat. Right. Oh, yeah, we're back to that. I've got the alien in the octopus. But it's like the mindset that wants everything to be a religion. Yeah. You know, and I think that's deeply built into people.
  Speaker 2
  Yeah, yeah, the reductionism. I mean, it simplifies reality. Yeah. It simplifies reality. Yeah, I like that. I mean, you do assume cognitive burden to take the harder path.
  Speaker 1
  Yeah, so on that note, back to my whole like useful, not true, my radical, what did I call it? [Time 1:39:44](https://readwise.io/open/543804549)

- Asking Mentors for Help: Tips on How to Write Succinct Dilemma Descriptions
  Key takeaways:
  • Having a mentor can be beneficial for personal growth and development.
  • When reaching out to mentors for help, it's important to be concise and not waste their time.
  • Before asking for help, it's recommended to write a good description of the issue, summarize the context, options, and thoughts.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  So let's segue from personal growth to mentors. Yeah. Because many people have had mentors. Many people seek mentors. Any people pine after mentors. And if they could only get ahold of person X and have a cup of tea or a coffee, pick the brain. Pick the brain. Pick the brain. Pick the brain. Some appealing. Have a meal.
  Speaker 1
  Who would not want to have their brain picked? Yeah.
  Speaker 2
  So how would you suggest people ask mentors for help?
  Speaker 1
  Here's what I do. I have three mentors. So anytime I hit a little dilemma in my life, I write a really good description of my dilemma before I reach out to them. Because I don't want to waste their time, right? Right. Mentors or VIPs. I don't want to waste a minute at a time. So first I write a really good description of the problem. And then I summarize it. I summarize the context, the problem. I summarize my options. And I summarize my thoughts. Because I got to make this succinct. I don't want to send somebody a 20 page long email. So I have to make this as succinct as possible. What does that in practice look like? A half page page page. Half page. Like bullet points for everything instead of paragraphs, right? Yep. As succinct as I can. And then before I send it to them, I try to predict what this person would say.
  Speaker 3
  So each of those three.
  Speaker 1
  Right, right. Would anybody would say to this? But yeah, what this mentor would say with that mentor would say, I know the way this guy thinks I've read all his books. [Time 2:00:11](https://readwise.io/open/543804550)

- Learning From Role Models: Spending Time with Those You Admire
  Key takeaways:
  • Spending time with people you admire and aspire to become more like is important.
  • You become the people you spend the most time with.
  • Perspectival knowledge and taking alternative positions are crucial skills to have.
  • Asking yourself "What would [insert admired person] do?" can help regulate your emotions and answer tough questions.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  And I think a lot of people would agree with you. And for those people who might wonder, I actually do something very similar. Okay. Can you tell? Yeah, absolutely. So I have, I try to spend time with people I admire and aspire to be more like in some capacity, right? Because I do think you become the people you spend the most time with. So to bring up a name that we've already brought up, I think actually a lot about Matt Mullen, because he's very calm in almost all circumstances. Not all. I know what the handful of things he bothered him, but he's very, very calm and measured and good at perspectival knowledge, taking alternative positions, taking the counter position On his own thoughts, his own opinions, his own goals. So I often think when I get dysregulated or upset about something, I'm getting wound up and I'm like, what would Matt do? And this, what would Matt say to me? If not wearing my shoes, what would Matt do? And I've also done that in writing exercises where I actually just sit down with my older self, who has figured it out.
