- What is Cliff Hang?
  Summary:
  "i was dropped into this thing with no understanding of what my capacities were," he says. "I had never connected with the natural world, and i had no idea that within me, and within all of us is this ability to navigate the natural world by simply connecting with stuff that we are born with" He's been cliff hung on several occasions but has always recovered well.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  Had you ever hunted prior to that show, or been involved with hunting? Not at all. Never.
  Speaker 1
  What i realized is, like, growing up in new hampshire, i felt like i was outdoorse and then i went with ve to alaska, and, oh, i'm not outdoors at all.
  Speaker 2
  I l i've never been off trail. I've never been off, like, a well marked trail.
  Speaker 1
  Then all of a sudden you standing in the middle like prince of wales island with steve. It's fuck and pouring rain. You're freezing cold. You're cliff hung, cause it's steve, and something always ha, what do you mean by cliff hung?
  Speaker 2
  What does that mean? What is cliff hung?
  Speaker 1
  So, cliff hung if you're, if you're, i think it usually happens when you're descending. But basically, you say you're descending through heavy cover, and you get out to a cliff, and you make a decision, which is like, i can get down this thing.
  Speaker 2
  And you go down a drop that you can't come back up, then you realize that the drop, the next drop isn't 15 feet, at 60 feet, then your cliff n us yet. Oh, thato, that sounds like a great situation.
  Speaker 1
  And you got to figure it out. But figuring all that stuff out was, like, was incredible. Again, just, i was just like, i'm just a dude. I don't come from any kind of special background, not a green paray. You know, i was dropped into this thing with no understanding of what my capacities were. When i was put into an environment where you have to rely on like, your natural instincts and your ability to do shet in, your ability to like, knot get yourself huck and killed when you're Out in the woods. And at first i was like, i can't do this. And by the way, i've got a 50 pound pack on in a camera all the time. So i got one hand. Everyone else got two hands. At first it was terrifying. I remember that first time we got a little bit cliff hung and i'm lake, where's the sapphone? Let's call t the coast guard. And they're like, they're like, te men, we don't call the coast guard over this. Trust me, you're going to be ok. And it was an incredible and incredible realization to be like, oh, wait, i am going to be ok. I've got all that, all the stuff is innate in being human that i need to like, survive this and to figure it out and to deal with it. Whereas, i think a lot of my career up to that point had been like, how to navigate the human world, the constructed world, ye, right? I had never connected with the natural world, and i had no idea that within me, and within all of us was this ability to navigate the natural world by simply connecting with stuff that We are born with. Steve brought that out of me. And once i realized that, then the whole world opened and you're like, oh my god. I'm in the middle of this highly dynamic, highly visual thing that we can just run with. [Time 0:48:58](https://readwise.io/open/543804578)

  Summary:
  He wasn't an assel. He could be incredibly frustrating to work with, but there was something under it. Once you were kind of in his sphere, he really did care about people. In the field, it was more like s that were cumbersome or inconvenience tony, he didn't like messiness. And i have not worked with james cameron. I know a number of people who have.

  And i have not worked with james cameron. I know a number of people who have. Though i don't think you're ever going to get that moment with michael, or with someone like michael mann, or someone like james cameran, were you're like sitting down and drinking Beers with them out in the desert and talking about like relit and things that really mean something. And like with tony, you did. And that was the difference. He was actually, he was a friend, and a very, very important friend whom i miss every single day. He was not those guys. He wasn't an assel. He could be an assel. He could be an assel all the time. He could be incredibly frustrating to work with. But there was something under it. There was something very loving there. There was something very caring. And once you were kind of in his sphere, he really did care about people. So from that perspective, it was different from the work perspective, though, he wasn't going to immince words in the same way that he wasn't going to mince words when a dish isn't right In the kitchen. Like, you can'tit doesn't work that way, unless you want 20 fucking rosotos sent back. You better get the first one rightan someone fucks it up youd, better let them know that they fucked it up big time right now immediately, and correct the problem. And that was a lot of the process with tony in post, for sure. In the field, it was more like s that were cumbersome or inconvenience tony, he didn't like messiness.

  Summary:
  "I not like an upbeat travel show or a leg o to day were, you know, it's not. It was an exploration of the world in all the permutations of what that means," she says. "If you don't understand pain, you don't understanding fear, you don’t know those things, you are never going to be able to see it."
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  I not like an upbeat travel show or a leg o to day were, you know, it's not. It was an exploration of the world in all the permutations of what that means. And if you don't understand pain, you don't understand fear, you don't know those things, you are never going to be able to see it. You're not going to be able to see it. And i don't mean to be dismissive of anyone, but i remember we, you know, at one point had a new editor coming on for a show, and i talked to him for ten minutes on the phone, and i asked him A few questions, what your favorite showis? Whats your life like? You know, what do you do for what your hobbies? An, sted like that. And i called my, you know, shar show round er, sandys wig, and i said, i'm sorry, this isn't going to work. An she's like, why os? Like he's to fuck and happy. Life's too good. Everything's ok with him, and he's not going to get it. And he didn't. And that wasn't prophetic on my part. It was just knowing that we had to embrace those things. [Time 1:37:05](https://readwise.io/open/543804580)

- Do You Know Where That 100 Degree Line Is?
  Summary:
  It was, we did two and vagus, we did tat. We did the poker, the heads up poker, and then we did the evasive driving. So you have two characters moving around in a dynamic environment there. They're constantly crossing each other. Now you need to know where that hundred and 80 degree line is all the time. And both your cameras need to be tuned up enough to move with that line.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  It was, we did two and vagus, we did tat. We did the poker, the heads up poker, and then we did the evasive driving. Yes, that ware evasive tactics, right? Becaue. We ar also on it was getting atsiptisand, yes, exactly.
  Speaker 1
  So you have two characters moving around in a dynamic environment there, and they're constantly crossing each other. They're constantly crossing the line. They're constantly moving around. Now you need to know where that hundred and 80 degree line is all the time. And both your cameras need to be tuned up enough to move with that line and re establish that line without thinking about it, and without talking ad the dance that you're seeing. So when you talk about the dance, the dance is really maintaining that coverage in a way that is going to make sense for the editor and ultimately make sense for the audience. And it is difficult to learn. And once you do learn it, like with anything else that's fun to do, it's a blast. It's really cool to work with someone that understands how that works.
  Speaker 2
  Know, if this thi schedule we had was normal, if it is, i don't know how the hell you guys do it for so long. [Time 1:52:18](https://readwise.io/open/543804581)

- How Do You Transition From a Creative to a Manageral Role?
  Summary:
  "Get ready to relinquish control. If you don't, you are going to smother the people who are working under you," she says. "Part of that is bringing good people in and understanding when you need to let people do their job."
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  Transitioning from a more narrowly creative role to a broader creative role with more managerial responsibilities? So there there are many ways t to approach thus. I mean, i suppose the the simplest way would just be to say, what advice would you give to someone who is really technical and good at one thing, right? Theyde they're really exceptional, and they hope to embrace or thei'r being asked to embrace a role that is broader with manageral responsibilities? Ke, what advice would you give to your younger self as you are doing that, or to some one else who's in the similar in a similar position?
  Speaker 1
  Get ready to relinquish control. Because if you don't, you are going to smother the people who are working under you. You need to trust them, and you need to be able to work with the people who need work in a pro active manner to get them to the place where you need them to be. Because you are not going to be able to control everything any more. When you have the camera in your hand. You have this tiny little world in the view finder, and you can control every aspect of it. As you start to climb the ladder up to directing and then to show running, you need to depend on other people. So part of that is bringing good people in. The other part is understanding when you need to let people do their job. [Time 2:00:30](https://readwise.io/open/543804582)

- The Muzzle Break
  Summary:
  Muzzle break is a way to dispense the energy of the bullet coming out of the gun. It can provide accuracy and safety by pushing energy of firing the bullet out to the sides. This muzzle break was made by jmac customs and west virginia, an independent operation which takes people who were laid off in coal mines and various other extractive industries that have left west virginia. I'm not particularly in guns, but i respect what they're doing. And i'll probably get a little bit of commentary on line about my understanding of the dynamics and muzzle breaks.

I'm not particularly in guns, but i respect what they're doing. And i'll probably get a little bit of commentary on line about my understanding of the dynamics and muzzle breaks, but that's what the inderdets for west virginia for me, you know. And this is a very personal story, so if everyone can bear it with me, like, west virginia, for me, was the most important thing that i ever did. When i said west virginia, like talking about the parts unknown episode of west virginia. I had lived in west virginia when i was a kid, and my family went through a pretty tough time when we were there. My parents were kind of on the rocks.

You look atthe phoan book and itis like half the people in the phone book are comous. It is another place that is just driving this kind of like a, how does one even say it?
