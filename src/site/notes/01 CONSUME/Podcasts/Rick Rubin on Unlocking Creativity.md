  I think so all right so I'll go with Robert Henry H-E-N-R-I the object isn't to make art it's to be in that wonderful state which makes art inevitable I would love for you to flesh this out A little bit and maybe the way to do it would be to pure stories of your own I mean you may have just given one but how you cultivate the precursors the elemental pieces of this state that Makes art inevitable and that could be through yourself could be through people you've worked with but what does that look like when it's done well the whole book is a is the answer to
