## Show notes


In this episode of "The Ezra Klein Show," Tom Friedman discusses his recent trip to China and how he believes the Washington consensus on China is dangerously wrong. He highlights China's advancements in manufacturing and technology, surpassing the United States in many ways. Friedman emphasizes the need for the U.S. to develop its domestic manufacturing to avoid being "steamrolled" by China.

Friedman also talks about critical fields of the future such as A.I., E.V.s, and clean energy, and why he sees the current consensus as outdated and risky. The episode contains strong language.
