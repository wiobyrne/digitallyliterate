## Highlights
- Episode AI notes
  1. Philosophers have varying perspectives on the mind and its workings, including a point of view called theory of mind; neuroscientists, on the other hand, are making tangible progress in answering big questions with concrete solutions.
  2. Testing the requirement of theory of mind for consciousness through observing diseases where it is impaired could provide insight into the link between consciousness and genetics.
  3. Octopuses are shown to display hunting behavior and other traits similar to humans, indicating that they may exhibit some form of theory of mind.
  4. Clinical trials for a fragile X disease drug failed despite promising animal studies, leading researchers to question the differences between animals and humans and the potential involvement of other factors.
  5. Critical periods in animal behavior, discovered by Conrad Lorentz, occur during the first 48 hours after hatching and may be reopened by psychedelics to learn in radically different environments.
  6. Deprivation may reopen our social critical period to make it easier to learn new things, which could explain why it's easier to learn languages where the dominant language is not one's own.
  7. Physical therapy can help recover lost motor function within a small window of time after a stroke, and researchers are exploring the potential of psychedelics to reopen critical periods for recovery.
  8. Tax breaks given to large corporations exceed the entire discretionary budget, and American taxpayers' investment in science and technology in the 50s and 60s made current tech ventures possible.
  9. Prominent figures recommend must-read books to explore gender issues and the world of psychedelics. [View Highlight](https://readwise.io/open/564409977)

- Exploring the Philosophy of Mind and the Concept of Theory of Mind
  Summary:
  Philosophers have been examining the concept of the mind from different perspectives, considering what it is and what it's not.
  Questions about how we know the mind and if we can compare people's descriptions arise. The concept of theory of mind is a viewpoint that has drawn interest, and it's more of a perspective than a theory like those in science.
  It's the shorthand for explaining what the mind is.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  It's not really a branch of philosophy or anything. It's just a thing that has drawn the attention of philosophers from a variety of different perspectives. Like you can imagine considering what is the mind from a metaphysical point of view. So what are the things that we count when we say this is what a mind is. This is what a mind is not. Then there are other considerations like, well, how do we know mind? You know, can we know mind just through introspection? Or is there some empirical way or some way that we can compare different people's descriptions of those things to get at what is mine? And that would be sort of the more epistemological approach to mind. And I was interested in all of those things. There continues to be debate about that. And one of the interesting ideas that I came across was that there was this concept of theory of mind, which is not really a theory in the way that we have a theory of light or a theory of synaptogenesis Or any of the more commonplace theories. It's more like it's a point of view. The shorthand way of explaining what the theory of mind is that I like to tell people is sort of what you're doing.

- Philosophical Considerations of the Mind and the Concept of Theory of Mind
  Summary:
  Philosophers have various perspectives on what the mind is.
  They consider it from a metaphysical and epistemological point of view. The concept of theory of mind is a way of understanding how the neurobiological process works when trying to anticipate the thoughts of others.
  It's a theory about what someone else might be thinking.

It's the neurobiological process that is going on when you're playing poker. It's anticipating what somebody else might be thinking and trying to see the world from their point of view. So in some sense, it's a theory about what somebody else might be thinking. [Time 0:09:29](https://readwise.io/open/543804626)

- Testing the Requirement of Theory of Mind for Consciousness through Disease Impairment
  Summary:
  Philosophy and science both ask big questions, but scientists come up with more concrete answers.
  The speaker likes the idea of testing theory of mind as a requirement for consciousness using diseases where that function is impaired. They have follow-up questions about whether theory of mind is human specific and if it applies to other animals like octopuses.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And I like this idea because it was a testable hypothesis. And one of the things that I found sort of frustrating about being a philosopher is that the philosophers were always asking the coolest questions, the biggest questions, but just Felt like, you know, they were just going around in circles and never really coming up with an answer that I found to be deeply satisfying. And on the other hand, you know, scientists, neuroscientists, you know, maybe they weren't getting to ask all the really big questions, but man, they were coming up with some concrete Answers that felt tangible and like we were getting somewhere. And so I like this idea that we could test the requirement of theory of mind for consciousness by looking at diseases where that function is impaired and learn something about the relationship Between consciousness and genes that encode different proteins that are required for that theory of mind.
  Speaker 2
  I have many, many follow up questions theory of mind does not seem to be based on the reading that I've done entirely human specific and is it true that you've observed this in for instance, And you're tapping on the shoulder, maybe think of it, hunting behavior in octopuses.

  Summary:
  Neuroscientists may not be asking big questions, but they are making tangible progress.
  The theory of mind can be tested by observing diseases where this function is impaired to learn more about the relationship between consciousness and genetics. Octopus behavior shows traits of theory of mind similar to humans.

  Speaker 1
  Those were actually not my experiments, those were experiments done by really imminent octopus researcher Roy Caldwell, and he showed me the videos of them. And as soon as I saw the videos of the octopus is hunting, it occurred to me that that is exactly a theory of mind like behavior in an octopus. [Time 0:12:55](https://readwise.io/open/543804628)

- Aggressiveness and Social Behavior in Octopuses
  Summary:
  Octopuses vary in aggressiveness, with some males being so aggressive that they leave their reproductive arm in the female mantle to escape being eaten.
  Only their arm is found after mating. Some species are less aggressive but still social.
  The hunting behavior of the Pacific stripe octopus, the only known social species, offers an opportunity to study the development of theory of mind and species-specific advantages.
  Despite being social, this behavior is used for hunting, not social interactions.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And there are differences in the amount of aggressiveness that we observe in octopuses, some are so aggressive that we've never even seen the males of the species because when they Mate, they like leave their hecticodilus arm, which is their reproductive arm in the mantle of the female and eject it and escape so that they don't get eaten. So we've only ever found their hecticodilus arm. That's how aggressive that species is. Okay. So other species of octopus aren't quite so aggressive, but they're still a social. And it was interesting because the species of octopus that does that hunting behavior is the only known social species of octopus. It seems like an interesting opportunity to test these ideas about what are the selection pressures that make theory of mind develop across evolution and what are the species specific Advantages to having a theory of mind. But it's interesting also because even though the larger Pacific stripe octopus, which is the octopus that does that hunting behavior is social, it's not using this behavior in a social Context that's using it in a hunting context, which suggests that, you know, maybe [Time 0:14:54](https://readwise.io/open/543804629)

- The Limitations of Mouse Studies in Fragile X Research
  Summary:
  Exciting lab work led to human clinical trials for a drug to cure fragile X disease.
  But the trials failed, leading some to blame differences between mice and humans. However, others pursued a more cautious approach and recognized the potential for other factors at play.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And so that was really exciting, something like 26 other labs followed up on that work, and several big pharmaceutical companies said, okay, this is it, this is the mechanism based Therapy that we've been looking for, and ran several very large scale human clinical trials for that metapotropic glutamate receptor modulator that we thought would correct the Imbalance it in fragile X. And when they did those studies, everybody was hugely disappointed because we were expecting, you know, the drugs to work and to cure the disease and we really got very little evidence To support that view. And I think at the time, all the people who are doing human research and clinical trials were just willing to throw their hands up and say, well, see, we told you a mouse is not a human, and That's why the human trials didn't work because all of the human trials were based on mouse studies and this was just where we went wrong. But a few of us kind of took a more circumspect view and said, well, yeah, okay, mice aren't humans, but there were a lot of other differences between the human trials.

- Screening for FMR1 in pregnancy and age correlations with autism
  Summary:
  FMR1 is rare, so screening tests are not usually done unless there is a family history of Fragile X. Unlike Down syndrome, there is no age correlation with autism, and the causes are individually rare.
  The idea of critical periods in behavior came from a 1935 study on imprinting.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  I believe, I mean, it's been a long time since I was in medical school, but last time I was, I looked into that, I believe it was still the case that FMR1 was rare enough that it wasn't worth It to do the screening test to try and find it because, you know, you have to balance doing a screening test against the possibility that the test itself is going to cause problems with The pregnancy. And so there is a sort of a judgment call there. And unless you had a family history of Fragile X, I think that it's still the case that people don't actually test for it beforehand. It's not like Down syndrome also where there's any strong indication that in Down syndrome, you know, there seems to be, there is a correlation between the age of the mother and the likelihood Of getting Down syndrome. For schizophrenia, there seems to be a correlation between the age of the father and getting schizophrenia. But for autism, as far as I know, there is no age dependent correlation with your likelihood of getting it. And all of the causes of autism are each individually so rare and there's no screening test that is generally applicable that would be worth doing.
  Speaker 2
  Let's just revisit as promised the reopening of the critical period.
  Speaker 1
  The idea of critical periods first came in 1935 by Conrad Lorentz, who is a ethologist who was studying imprinting behavior in snow geese. [Time 0:27:09](https://readwise.io/open/543804631)

- Critical Periods and Imprinting Behavior in Snow Geese
  Summary:
  Conrad Lorentz discovered critical periods in animal behavior while studying snow geese imprinting.
  This phenomenon is when animals form lasting attachments to moving objects nearby, like motorized airplanes. The attachment only occurs within 48 hours of hatching, making it a sensitive period for learning.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  The idea of critical periods first came in 1935 by Conrad Lorentz, who is a ethologist who was studying imprinting behavior in snow geese. So this is the behavior that shortly after hatching, the animals will form a long lasting attachment typically to their mother. But if the mother isn't around and instead it's sort of a motorized airplane or the scientist in that case Conrad Lorentz himself, then they'll form that attachment to that other moving Object and their vicinity. And you know, there are all these funny pictures online of Conrad Lorentz being followed around by little snow geese, right? Because they've formed this attachment.
  Speaker 2
  Wait, what are snow geese?
  Speaker 1
  They're just a type of geese? Okay, there we go.
  Speaker 2
  Just wanted to figure out. Sounds like a little Scandinavian dwarf or something. No, no, they're just like type of geese. Type of geese birds.
  Speaker 1
  Okay, so they're just followed around by these birds. They're really cute pictures. And this imprinting behavior, though, if you wait, so if you wait until 48 hours after hatching, then they don't form this behavior, right? So this attachment is only possible. Within the first 48 hours of hatching and Conrad Lorentz called that period of time when the animals are extremely sensitive to their environment and can form these long lasting memories.

- The Origins of Critical Periods and Imprinting Behavior in Snow Geese
  Summary:
  In 1935, Conrad Lorentz discovered the critical period for imprinting behavior in snow geese.
  If the mother isn't present, the geese will bond with other moving objects nearby. This behavior can only occur within the first 48 hours of hatching.
  Lorentz called this window of time the critical period and it has since been described for numerous things, including language acquisition.

He called that window of time the critical period and critical period since then have been described for so many different things. So probably the one that most people will be familiar with is the critical period for language learning. [Time 0:28:36](https://readwise.io/open/543804633)

- Why the Brain Has a Mechanism for Reopening Critical Periods
  Summary:
  The brain has a mechanism that allows psychedelics to reopen critical periods that were closed.
  This could be because the brain adapts to stable environments but needs to reopen to learn in a radically different environment. For example, learning a new language is not adaptive if everyone around you speaks English, but it becomes necessary if you move to a place where no one speaks English.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And sometimes you want to just get on with it. And if the environment that you're in is stable, then you don't need to necessarily be adapting or adjusting your model of the world every single move that you make. And so that's why we think that critical periods close. But then another question is, why does the brain have a sort of ready-made mechanism that psychedelics can tap into for reopening critical periods, right? Like, why can we reopen them so easily if the brain wasn't already built to do this? And this is really me speculating, but I suspect it's because when we have these habits, they're adaptive so long as the environment is stable. But then there's a radical shift in the environment. Then you can imagine that there would be adaptive to be able to reopen critical periods and relearn from your environment. So going back to the language example, you know, as long as everybody around you speaks English, it's probably not all that adaptive to be learning Spanish. But if you move to Spain, or you move to Central America, then suddenly nobody's speaking English, and you want to be able to learn the language that everybody's speaking around you.

- The Effects of Deprivation on Critical Periods and Language Learning
  Summary:
  Deprivation can reopen our social critical period, making it easier to learn new things.
  This could explain why it's easier to learn Spanish in Guatemala, where English is not spoken as widely. Historically, religious practices across cultures have used deprivation techniques to achieve a mystical state.
  This could be similar to the concept of 'beginner's mind' in Zen Buddhism, which can be explained through the reopening of critical periods.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  There's evidence for this, that this deprivation induced reo, you know, can also reopen our social critical period. So here's another rule that kind of applies across critical periods is that deprivation is a technique. And so this might be the explanation, for example, for why it's easier to learn Spanish if you go to Guatemala than if you go to Costa Rica, because in Costa Rica, everybody speaks Spanish, But everybody also speaks English, right? So it's very hard, you're not deprived of English, you're just exposed to Spanish, whereas in Guatemala, almost nobody speaks English, and so you're deprived and you get the language. So that's one idea that we have, we don't, we haven't proven it. But the other part of that is that it's an interesting to note that historically religious practices across many, many different cultures have used deprivation techniques to get To that mystical state that people talk about Zen Buddhist call it beginner's mind. If you were looking for a neurobiological description of beginner's mind, reopening critical periods would be it. [Time 0:47:18](https://readwise.io/open/543804635)

- The Window for Physical Therapy After a Stroke
  Summary:
  Physical therapy can help stroke patients recover lost motor function within a small window of time, ideally 6 weeks to 2 months.
  This critical period is due to adjacent brain regions becoming flexible again. While a second stroke is the current method of reopening this period, it is not viable.
  Researchers are exploring the potential of psychedelics to reopen critical periods for motor recovery.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  For a long time now, clinically, we have known that right after you have a stroke, you have this very short window of time, really, really close by three months, but really you want to Get in there within six weeks to two months or so, where physical therapy is going to have its maximal effect or benefit for helping you to recover the motor function that you lost because Of the stroke. Okay. And that window of time, you know, we don't exactly know why it closes, but it seems to be that it's not that the damaged part of the brain suddenly melts neurons. It's that the brain regions immediately adjacent to the damaged part of the brain become flexible again and able to perform or control the motor functions that were lost by the brain Region immediately next to it. So, we have this window closes, just like all other critical periods close and so far, the best way that we have for reopening that critical period is to give another stroke, but nobody Wants to cure stroke by giving another stroke. It's a really, really, really, really useful way hard to sell hard to sell that. Yeah, definitely harder, you know, we, and so we like the idea that maybe we could branch out into other critical periods like this one to see whether or not psychedelics can reopen that Critical period of motor recovery following stroke.

- Tax Breaks for Corporations and Technological Advances
  Summary:
  Taxpayers in the 50s and 60s invested in science and technology which has enabled today's tech ventures like Facebook, Google, and cell phones.
  Today, tax breaks given to big corporations exceed the discretionary budget.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  This is sort of venturing us into politics, which is a hobby, not my area of expertise. But I would certainly say that if we look at the percentage of taxpayer money, well, first of all, in the 50s and 60s, we collected a lot more taxes. Today, we give away more in tax breaks than the entire discretionary budget back to big corporations as incentives and tax breaks. But really, most of those corporations, the thing that they are making and selling right now, especially in the tech industry, are possible because the taxpayers in the 50s and 60s Made those investments in the science and technology areas to develop all of the computing and software building science and research that that stuff was built upon. Facebook and all of these tech ventures that we, and Google and cell phones and computers, they didn't just happen to arise out of America for no reason.

- The Importance of Data in Understanding Gender Issues and a Recommended Reading List
  Summary:
  Discover three must-read books recommended by a prominent figure.
  Among them are a feminist masterpiece, a revolutionary look at history, and a thrilling deep dive into the world of psychedelics.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  How did we wander into this political sphere? Probably the ones that I have gifted the most is a book called Invisible Women by Carolyn Criado Perez. You know, I really love it because I think it's a book of feminism that is accessible and I think resonates with people whether or not you're a man or a woman. It's just data. It's like, all right, well, you know, here's how much it costs to keep ignoring women. And if you fix it, your city can save a million dollars a year. It's all about the structural stuff. It's not about your feelings about whether women deserve to be in the kitchen or not. It's not about that. It's just here's how ignoring data about women's body sizes, women's travel patterns ends up costing society. It's an excellent way of kind of getting that. And then the other book that I love the most. It's a very grandiose title. It's called The Dawn of Everything, A New History of Humanity by David Graeber. Everything that that guy wrote, I started with this book called Bullshit Jobs, which, you know, I was dealing with like the bureaucracy of academia and feeling very frustrated. And I read that book and it was very cathartic. And then I just kind of went down the rabbit hole and have enjoyed all the other books. But the dawn of everything. It's a big book and it's pretty thick. But the last chapter has some really cool stuff about psychedelic uses in other cultures. And then the third one that I really love is the Immortality Key by Brian Marescu. I love that book so much like I designed my entire Halloween decoration this year all around that book.
