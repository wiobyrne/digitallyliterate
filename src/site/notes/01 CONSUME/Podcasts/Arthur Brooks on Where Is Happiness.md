![rw-book-cover](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fssl-static.libsyn.com%2Fp%2Fassets%2F0%2F9%2F7%2Fe%2F097e1e1107a7009a%2FMAKING_SENSE_MASTER.png&w=300&h=300)

Arthur C. Brooks, a social scientist and Harvard professor, dives deep into the essence of happiness. He explores the impact of social comparison and the importance of redefining self-worth. The conversation weaves through the complexities of intelligence, love, and compassion, touching on experiences with the Dalai Lama. Brooks emphasizes the need to transcend identity and ego in pursuit of true fulfillment, while also examining the intricacies of faith and belief in our lives. It's a thought-provoking journey into what makes life genuinely rewarding.



## Highlights
- The Importance of Focusing on Fluid and Crystallized Intelligence in Your Career
  Key takeaways:
  • Fluid and crystallized intelligence are two different types of intelligence, and the difference between them is that fluid intelligence gets better through your twenties and thirties, while crystallized intelligence stays high in your seventies and eighties.
  • The best way to use your fluid intelligence is to do things that reload on it, like being a poet or historian, while using your crystallized intelligence to learn new things and teach them.

  But let's go back to intelligence. Where we left it. We did not actually describe the difference between fluid and crystallized intelligence and the use to which you put these concepts in your book. So tell me, what are your thoughts on that topic?
  Speaker 1
  So could tell catel, the social psychology, breat great british social psychologist, notice that people, they get better at things through their twenties and thirties, tha kind Of ten thousand hours deal, where they have focus, the ability to work hard, a lot of working memory. And almost anything that you can get good at, from being an air pic controller to being a french horn player to being a college professor and researcher in particular, that requires Innovative capacity to crack the code to solve problems. That's fluid intelligence. And that gets better and better through your twenties and thirties. And and weirdly, it tends to pique in your late thirties or early forties, and then it tends to decline. And he noticed this, catel noticed this, that these abilities tend to decline. Now, if you're really a striver and you're really good at what you do, and most of the people listening to us right now. They're good at something. They're really the only ones in their forties who are going to notice these declines. And the way that you notice it is what, you know, people in the management world call burn out. So you find that your dentist, for example, when he's, let's say, forty three, has, weirdly, start taking fridays off to golf. Sik, why would you do that? Do this trivial kind of hobby instead of doing something that you you love, like being a dentist? And the answer is, because humans aren't happy when they're not making progress. The mathematicians will put it that all of happiness is in the first derivative, all of happiness is in getting better the stateis. This is a reason, by the way, sam, that that is very easy to lose weight, but it's very hard to keep weight off. Because when the scaleis going down, you're motivatedn ands. When you hit your goal, the the, the, the reward for hitting your goal is now you never get to eat the things you like ever again, for the rest of your life. Congratulations. And, you know, thiss, this is the nature of, you know, how we're wired. Progress is everything. And so what happens is that people get very frustrated and angry, desperate and afraid and sad when they're on the down slope of this. Cris this fluid intelligence curve, what he also, what catel also pointed out, is there's a second intelligence curve behind it that doesn't reward the same things. It's called crystallized intelligence, and is based on all the things you now and how to use the things that you know. So your working memory is a lot worse, your innovative capacity is worse, your speed and your ability to solve problems is worse, but your wisdom is higher, your pattern recognition Is higher, your vocabulary is higher, your teaching ability is higher. And so what you need to do you want to use that, is actually start doing the things that favor that increasing intelligence. The great news, incredible news, is that crystallized intelligence increases through your forties and fifties and even sixties, and stays high in your seventies and eighties. So there's a guy at nese california, at davis, again, m den simonton, who's the world's, i mean, you, i don't know if yo've had him on your show. He's no, not o as he looks he's wonderful. Imean, he talks about the cadence of creative careers, and he talks about the half life, where he measures the corpus of work in quantity and quality of people in different creative Careers. And he finds that those that have that load on fluid intelligence, like poetry, where you're just inventing stuff with words, that that has a a half life a round age forty, where you've Done half of your lifetime work around age forty. When you think about it, you know, t s eliot esra pound, their best works were written in their late twenties and early thirties. And both guys lived in their eighties. Now, if you at something that reloads on crystallized intelligence, the body of knowledge and how to use it, like historians, they're basically just teachers. You have to note, yuuve to have the new york public library in your head to be able to be a historian. Their half, their half way point, is about aged 65. So if you're a historian, take care of your health, cause your best books are coming in your eighties, is the point. And thas the difference between a career that loads on fluid and a career that loads on crystallized now our our job, you and me, is to be walking, in our forties and fifties, from our fluid Intelligence curve on to our crystallized intelligence curve by manifesting what we do in different ways. Probably that goes from no writing mathematical theorems, which i was doing, to writing a column in the atlantic and teaching at harvard, which i'm doing. Now, this podcast that you're doing, isa, is like a a master display and crystallized intelligence, because you're teaching with this particular podcast. This is a good thing tha you're doing to fav what you're naturally getting good at in your fifties. [Time 0:45:58](https://readwise.io/open/543804659)
