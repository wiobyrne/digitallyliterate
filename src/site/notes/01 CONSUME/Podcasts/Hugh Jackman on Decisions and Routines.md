- Meditation Gives Me a Finer Energy
  Summary:
  meditation has been a tool of that provides, helps to provide clarity in some respects. The best way i can describe it is the effect that it has on me. I don't always get out o meditation like ready to, you know, do a one hour pelaton class,. but i always come out with a finer energy. A, it feels, my intention feels clearer. My listenings is er, more purposeful and and things feel easier and more connected.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  I know you've meditated for decades now, and you and deb meditate in the mornings. And i say that is a segway, because at least fom me, meditation has been a tool of that provides, helps to provide clarity in some respects. Could you describe your meditation practice and what you feel are the main benefits that are derived from that practice?
  Speaker 1
  Sure. I was introduced to meditation when i was at drama school. Ah, and i and was a form of transcendental meditation. Ah, there's lots of different types of meditation. Just very briefly, it involves the use of a mantra which you are given, which you repeatedly sound. And the very basic concept is that we the nature of our minds is to always be working, always be thinking. And the trick to life is not letting that might be your master, but to let her be a servant. Then it's an incredible thing onct have become. Once it's running the show at you. No, it's very easy to get off tracks. So this period of meditation, you are given a mantre, which was described to me as the mind is often called the monkey mind in eastern philosophies. So a monkey, you know, is very energetic, and if not given something to do, will be mischievous. So the mantre is like hastily saying to the monkey mind, i need you to climb to the top of that telegraph pole, and when you get to the top, i need you to climb back down. And when you get bottom, i need you to climb back up. And when you get to the top, i need you climb back down. So it's just giving this activity. So demantaor this word that is silently repeated, ends up fading away. And the best way i can describe it is the effect that it has on me. I mean, sometimes i fall asleep, by the way, which is totally fine. And clearly, what my body needed. But when you first pour a glass of water, it's cloudy, and then in a period of time, that all settles and you see crystal clear. I throw the glass through the water. That's what meditation does for me. It's that feeling where things drop down. I have a feeling of coming home, the feeling of experiencing my true self, and not just being caught up in the mind, or a being reactive to life. And it gives me a finer energy. I don't always get out o meditation like ready to, you know, do a one hour pelaton class, but i always come out with a finer energy. A, it feels, my intention feels clearer. My listenings is er, more purposeful and and things feel easier and more connected. [Time 0:14:18](https://readwise.io/open/543804614)

- I feel His pleasure when I run
  Summary:
  There's a kind of natural energy. And what i keep saying my kids actually, don't settle. Find that thing that resonates with you in that way where you feel some kind of the pleasure of the universe of consciousness and can do it longer. I dont know how you do that, but maybe that's in the same way i don't know how you tryin for ultra marathons, for example.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  But by one of my favorite moves of all time, and definitely my favorite quote from a movie of all time, is from chariots of fire, which i loved as a kid. And eric ladel, who's the religious runner, who decides not to run on the sabbath during the olympics. You've seen them every yr, ehso this is great scene. He's meant to be going off after the olympics to do missionary work in china, handing out bibles or something. And his sisters talking to him, she's like, you' got to throw away this silly running thing. Ah, we have really important god's work to do. I why are you doing this and spending time on this? Ou na beasly, kind of accusing him of not following god's will. And he just says, he looks at her and he says, but i feel his pleasure when i run. And i've always, somehow that line, it always makes me cheer up to saying it. That's what i feel on the stage. There's a kind of natural energy. And what i keep saying my kids actually, don't settle. Find that thing that resonates with you in that way where you feel some kind of the pleasure of the universe of consciousness, like thirs, some joy, where you feel you can do it longer. And in that way, it's not such a herculean effort. Although i'm going to tell you in a second, i have a bunch of sort of rituals and things that i do to make that i can be my best. But there is a natural energy that i understand other people going. I dont know how you do that, but maybe that's in the same way i don't know how you tryin for ultra marathons, for example.

- Sitting in the Wings
  Summary:
  I always take a minute before i go on stage, literally before, to pause, ah and just connect with the senses. Even if i'm not in the opening of a show, i will stand in the wings. I first of all like to just listen to that titter of excitement as people come in to the theatre because i love the theatre myself. It reminds me of how privileged i am and how much i owe every single audience member.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Aman, i think i'm the only actor i know whom i can be asleep within forty five minutes after getting off stage. There's something very calming. It's not its like you've had your greatest work out. You have a bath. That feeling after the bath, after a great workout, in the evening, when you just can sit and be at peace with youself, that i lave. So i limit the amount of coffee i have, just because you're battling dehydration with stage work all the time. I always, i have, i know what my routine is before i go on stage, and i'm religious about it. And that's more about quieting my mind a i don't ever want my monkey mind saying, oh, you didn't do your warm up to day, or you only half did it, or this or that, you haven't stretched, you Haven't tat, you didn't really eat very well to day. You might be the mind an my mind can easily pick upon that a the perfectional side of me. I always take a minute before i go on stage, literally before, to pause, ah and just connect with the senses. So even if i'm not in the opening of a show, i will stand in the wings. I first of all like to just listen to that titter of excitement as people come in to the theatre, because i love the theatre myself, and i remember that, and it reminds me of how privileged I am and how much i owe every single audience member.

- Christian through Actions
  Summary:
  My dad was not a a bible basher. He rarely talked about it. My mamma, i always remember her saying, she says it to this day, every one needs to feel appreciated. And so i got a lot of those lessons as i was growing into a man, with him being around. But someone people have noticed how you act is far stronger than what you say. And we all know that.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  The end of their marriage, they sourt of went down different paths, and mys. My dad was not a a bible basher. He rarely talked about it. And i remember saying, dad, because i was really about 13, 14, i was really in school, church groups, fellowship groups, and and i got one of those stickers that you put on the back of the Car. I said, dad, we should put that like we meant to do that. We meant to spread the word and do thisand when he said that to me, i was disappointed. I thought he was coppying out. But only later did i realize that when he said, people should know you're through your actions, you're so much more powerful. Ah, if someone eventually comes up to you and says, you know, there's something about you, man. I don't know what it is, but i'd love to know where i can get it, you know, then there's an opening. But someone people have noticed how you act is far stronger than what you say. And we all know that. Ah, i often speak a little more about my dad in interviews, because my mamma left when i was eight, so, ah, i was brought up from that moment on, primarily by my dad. And so i got a lot of those lessons as i was growing into a man, with him being around. But my mamma, i always remember her saying, she says it to this day, every one needs to feel appreciated.

- I Don't Care, God What It Is You Want Me To Do
  Summary:
  "I was brought up in a very religious household. A lot of the messages i was getting and instructions for life came through the examples of jesus," he says. "Even though my feelings about religion are different than what they were when i was younger, the essence is the same." 'There is some calling that is beyond the conscious brains strategizing of how to be happy and successfuln or meaningful in life'
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  I think this is probably the most vexing, most important, vital thing to work out in your life, certainly in my life. And i think about a lot to answer the question, what i do now i just, i think i need to take you back. I've never really said this before publicly, this particular thing i'm going to say. But as i told you, i was brought up in a very religious household. So a lot of the messages i was getting and instructions for life came through the examples of jesus, and through all these characters in the parables, in the in the bible. And i carry them very close to my heart. I can remember in nightly for i don't know how long, to god istic, i remember saying, i don't care, god what it is you want me to do. If you want me to collect trash, i'll colect trash if you want me to i do not care. But please make it clear to me what you want me to do. Please make that clear. I had much more fear of being on the wrong path then i had fear of failing it a path, if that makes sense. That whatever that decision was, whatever that moment of clarity becomes whatever gets you to that feeling of eric ladell and charit sofire, i feel his pleasure when i run. For me, that was always and i carry it to day. Even though my feelings about religion are different than what they were when i was younger, the essence is the same, that there is some calling, as joseph campbell would talk about, Follow your bliss. There is some calling that is beyond the conscious brains strategizing of how to be happy and successfuln or meaningful in life. There's something elemental and instinctual and honing that the people i admire the most really on, that ability ain big decisions in life, and too small day to day decisions.

- You Work Better With The 85 Percent Rule
  Key takeaways:
  • Rowing is a great exercise for the posterior chain and other compound movements, and can help to improve breathing and relaxation.
  • Imagining the activity is already completed can help to reduce anxiety and improve performance.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  That's as excellent advice, no, that the rower hits your enti almost your entire posterior chain. And then you do some pu and yu're you're in good shape, ye.
  Speaker 1
  It' such a good building exercise for dead lifts and all these cor movements, compound movements, getting you scapula, everything sort of in the right place, and your breathing and Relaxing your neck, you know, at the same time as doing it.
  Speaker 2
  Ah, i would say the rower, and i love the the 85 % run at 85 % effort example that you gave. I find so much truth in that statement. I haven't ever thought of it. But you could apply that to sitting down and writing. You could apply it to almost anything where being or pretense is not your friend.
  Speaker 1
  Its not going to help you. N no. And that's my i gave, is got different things. If i was coaching me myself, i give, i was the coach and jackman was on my team, i wouldn't put more pressure on him, push him more. I wouldn't yell at him, scream that i've got that motivation. If anything, i have had to work from building up insecurity. So i'm not good enough. I need to work extra hard. Ah, if i do everything perfectly and i work my as off, then i'll be a cak.
