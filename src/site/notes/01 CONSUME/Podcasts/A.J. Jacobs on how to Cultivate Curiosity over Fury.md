And actually, i interviewed alex trebeck, the late great alex rebeck from jeopardy once, and he's sad a quote that i still think about all the time. Even though it doesn't quite make sense, it still totally makes sense to me. And that quote is, i'm curious about everything, even those things that don't interest me. So he's curious about everything, even the most boring things. And i love that, because i think it's true. Whatever the topic is, you are going, if you dig a little, you're going to find fascinating. And in fact, i once thought of trying to lake a challenge where i write a book about the most stereotypically boring thing in the world, maybe it's counting, and try to make it interesting Because it, i'm sure it is. It's not about numbers. It's about people. It's about actions and business and love and hate. So anyway, curios i think puzzles just fuel my curiosity. And as i said, i see the world as a puzzle. I have what i like to call the puzzle mind set, which is, i think, so important when you are looking at world problems, to adopt the puzzle mind set, which is opposed to the motivated reasoning Or anger mind set. There's a child psychologist i saw who said, get furious, get curious, as parenting advice. But i think that's great life advice, because that really is. If you're going to solve a problem, curiosity is the way to do it, not anger. Anger gives you tunnel vision. [Time 0:26:12](https://readwise.io/open/543804604)

Like if i'm talking to someone from the opposite side of the political spectrum, instead of seeing it as a debate, a war of words, i try to see it as a puzzle that we can try to solve together. What is our real differences and how can we overcome them? Is there any evidence i can present to him or her to make her change her mind? What is how do we solve this puzzle? That, to me, is is a sort of the big thesis thrust of the book, don't get furious. Well, get a little furious sometimes you need to. But but balance it with curiosity.
