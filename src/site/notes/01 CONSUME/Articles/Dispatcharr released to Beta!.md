# Dispatcharr released to Beta!

## Key Points:
Hey everyone 👋

I’m one of the developers of [**Dispatcharr**](https://github.com/Dispatcharr/Dispatcharr) — a new open-source IPTV and EPG manager that just hit **BETA** 🎉. We started this after **StreamMaster went privat**e and **aIPTV vanishe**d, leaving the community with no reliable options.

Dispatcharr lets you import and proxy IPTV streams, auto-match EPG data, and output to M3U, HDHomeRun, and XMLTV — perfect for Plex, Jellyfin, or whatever setup you’re running. It’s fully self-hosted, Docker-ready, and runs fast with FFmpeg or Streamlink on the backend.

We built this to be **owned by the community**, licensed under **CC BY-NC-SA** — so it’ll stay open forever. If you’ve been looking for a solid replacement with real flexibility, give it a spin.

> This looks great. I just read your readme on GitHub. Will join the Discord. If I'm reading this correctly, you have the ability to auto detect a channel failure on any given playlist and automatically switch to the same functioning channel on a secondary or tertiary playlist (or more)? No more failed recorded programs showing up on the DVR when I go to watch it 3 days later because of the auto fail over capability. Correct?

I watch TV almost exclusively on my Sony Bravia running the Google TV OS.
