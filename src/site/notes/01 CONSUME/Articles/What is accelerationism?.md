# What is accelerationism?


> **ProgressiveArchitect** • [103 points](https://reddit.com/r/CriticalTheory/comments/tv8ckf/comment/i37z24p/) • 2022-04-03
> 
> It's based on the theory that Capitalism (like Slavery & Feudalism before it) has inherent contradictions built into the internal workings of the system itself, and that these 'Internal Contradictions' will continue building within the system as it develops/matures until they reach a critical threshold where the system can no longer tolerate/cope with the amount of 'Internal Contradictions' that have emerged, and when that happens the system ceases to be able to function (dies) making way for the next system.
> 
> The theory of 'Accelerationism' builds on this idea, by proposing that we should accelerate capitalism's growth/development so that the 'Internal Contradictions' emerge more quickly, and lead to the system dying sooner, so we can move to the next system faster.

In his view he wants to make life “multi-planetary” and accelerating Climate Change, Political, Racial, and Economic Unrest it in theory (his theory) would give more importance and power to his plan to expand beyond our planet to escape the downfall of this world. Theres also the Georgia Guidestones which hinted at a form of accelerationism to cause the fall of civilization and to rebuild it into something new with population controls, economic, educational, and political controls.

> Think of it more like this:
> 
> Amazon recently conceded to a union being formed at one of its fulfillment centers.
> 
> A gradualist would argue that the outcome is positive because this unionization may lead to other worker organizations and improve worker lives.
> 
> An accelerationist might point out that allowing Amazon to strategically choose when and how to concede to worker pressure gives them a tactical advantage in the class struggle, inevitably causing the struggle to be attenuated for longer than it ought to be.
> 
> So a gradualist would take this as a tactical victory, whereas the accelerationist would view it as a tactical draw. It doesn’t mean an accelerationist doesn’t support worker unionization, it means that an accelerationist views any action which is taken on the terms of capital is necessarily a compromise and not a true win.

> > > 
> > > Meth and speed are also conducive to capitalist production as they promote energy and productivity, reduce appetite, reduce (perceived) need for rest etc. There's a reason that the two most widely distributed drugs under capitalism are caffeine and nicotine. Alcohol obviously too, but each of caffeine and nicotine came into widespread global use with ythe development of international trade and capitalism, being sourced from new world, whereas alcohol/fermentation has been independently discovered by cultures all over the world. For that matter sugar is also one of the principle addictive drugs that the international system of capitalist trade is built on

Gee for shades of fundamentally misunderstanding of sociology and history just to find and outlet for nihilistic-destructive urges and come to a conclusion without having to look far. Like these is such are ridiculous unaware approach es with their own ideological flavor of bias and origin for their . We aren’t in level so and so and capitalism isn’t a closed off thing. It’s so much more complex like humans in generally (relatively speaking as evident here) Like leaning back pressing fast forward is literally what someone would do who has no clue of anything, no desire to find out but in this scenario a position where he makes a decision. Oh things are bad everything turns out gud cuz always has hehe. Dude this is the exact mindset that made the difference between 60000 years of petty murder and 2000 of building stuff doing things right and achieving actually achieving things. How do you explain yourself the exponential growth by capitalism in this whole scenario you don’t cuz ur friggin “accelerationism only exists so you don’t have to ask these questions yourself. Besides, how is this self-destruction gonna look - vague and in 4 flavors I get it. But ugh - if you don’t care don’t get involved in it, if you want to feel like a smart ass I advise you to something your good at and enjoy. Not things you solely look up cuz u think they make u “better” first you need to know what being better means for you and to a lot of people it’s fairly straightforward -that’s how the term “pretentious” stays in rotation (and politicans but nah y’all won’t Save Palestine with a fast forward button)

> We should be careful giving Wikipedia definitions of these kinds of things. "Accelerationism," in any of its deleuzoguattarian forms, has nothing to do with "accelerating the contradictions of capitalism." It has never been some pseudo-Hegelian enterprise of negativity (which, if you ask Ben Noys, is part of the problem). To dispel these misunderstands I'd read Wolfendale's and Land's "introductions."

Still, the metaphor of speed and acceleration inherent in it seems less apt than those of urgency sometimes. I am also not quite sure fighting capitalism at its own speed helps us. Capitalism is not human. We can build institutions that might approach its speed but I am not sure that's the way we should be going. Thanks for a broader perspective on the matter in any case.

> > > I want post-capitalism, thankyou-very-much, and there’s plenty other people like me. The question should not be: when is it going to happen? but: what can we do to make it happen? No doubt this sounds remarkably impatient to those who concern themselves with the grand arc of history, but there is no reason why this attitude need be impatient. I don’t want my post-capitalism right this minute, I want it as soon as possible, and just how soon that is is an open question. Personally, I’m pretty sure I won’t see it in my lifetime, but this doesn’t mean that I’m any less committed to nurturing the seeds of future post-capitalism I see germinating in the capitalist present. The real leftist accelerationist heresy is nothing to do with technology, but consists in the refusal to see the transition between capitalism and post-capitalism as a neat break, or as the emergence of a new order out of the immanent (and often imminent) collapse of the old one. This is not a retreat into reformism, but an insistence upon seeing the end of capitalism as a complex and messy historical transformation of the kind that occurred between feudalism and capitalism – a transformation which can and should be accelerated.

In cultural studies, it has been argued that vaporwave (visual and music aesthetic) is embedded in the politics of accelerationism by posing a nostalgiac reflection of a dystopic late stage capitalism. If you’re interested, [this chapter](https://books.google.com/books?id=uC0lDwAAQBAJ&lpg=PA81&pg=PA95#v=onepage&q&f=false) is a great read. I found it very interesting and it helped me better understand the manifestation and effects of accelerationism as it applies to digital semiotic domains. Hopefully this helps illuminate your question!

> There is a strong body of research that states that any state conflict that is not classified as a “Gandhi Trap” ends with an groundswell of reactionary support. The Gandhi Trap is any situation where a person deemed morally just, righteous, and in a position under authority is brutally and unjustly assaulted by people in positions of authority. Any other kind of state violence drives people deeper into reactionary politics. This is born out by social science research.
> 
> Accelerationism doesn’t work because fomenting conflict for conflict’s sake, or to sow the seeds of revolution, just makes reactionary policies more likely. It radicalizes a populace on an individual level, but towards authoritarian rule and not socialism or social democracy.
> 
> What we SHOULD be thinking about are institutions that create alternate, meaning false, narratives around protests or political movements, because those have the power to circumvent The Gandhi Trap. Fox News does this all the time. If half the country hears that all center-leaning political discourse is the work of “the radical left” and state authority, particularly conservative state authority, can do no wrong, then the state can never be moved left because one of the left’s most powerful tools for change, The Gandhi Trap, no longer works.

Accelerationism is a theoretical tendency that is based in deleuzo-guattarian politics and focuses on the acceleration of desire, technology, capitalist deterritorialisations etc. in an effort to break *beyond* capitalism by removing the roadblocks it puts in place to reign in its own decoding tendencies. It has nothing to do with accelerating contradiction. It involves accelerating certain tendencies within capitalism to "beat it at its own game" and go further into a leftist society.

> When I heard the word for the first time, it seemed to mean that the state of things is undesirable and in order to advance the inevitable collapse or shift in power, it becomes not only our right, but out moral responsibility to consume resources and commit previously thought ethically devoid acts at a more rapid pace. In other words, many things that were once thought lazy or irresponsible or even evil are actually altruistic because it reduces eventual proliferation and prolonging of human suffering. IE shoplifting, not recycling, using petroleum products, tax evasion, fraud. But upon further inspection if. Became clear to me that the connotation that I wanted the word to have was actually in more of an efficiency context rather than a long term singular goal. Like, if you have philanthropist aspirations, it actually serves the world better if you aren't worried about being an ethical consumer. It's a waste of your time and energy, because your purpose is to serve the needs of others, rather than your personal need to be a good and just individual citizen. I guess it kind of lit something in my mind that was liberating as a concept, because I see so much policing of individual expression and attack on character, that it just feels like a calculated distraction to focus on who someone is rather than what someone actually does. So I don't know if this is helpful or not, but regardless of what accelerationism means, the word has left me with the freedom to eat the proverbial dorritos and throw the bag in the trash. You're allowed to pollute your body and the ground at a normal modern rate, as long as you're actually working towards something bigger.
