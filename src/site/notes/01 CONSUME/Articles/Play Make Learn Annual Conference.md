[![Play Make Learn Logo](https://dpi.wi.gov/sites/default/files/imce/play-make-learn/images/PML_Logo_Horizontal-01.png)](https://web.cvent.com/event/513f1d8b-d6a7-4fc2-986d-4973dc37c524/summary)

The **Play Make Learn** (PML) Annual Conference is a place for collaboration and discovery in the design, research and practice of playful learning, games for learning and positive social impact, making and makerspaces, STEAM education, research/practitioner partnerships, and arts in education (formal and informal spaces). PML creates an inspirational space for preK-12 educators, designers, developers, innovators, librarians, museum professionals, makers, and researchers to tinker together, share knowledge, and celebrate one another’s work.

The **PML 2025 Conference** will be held **August 21st & August 22nd**, at the **Memorial Union** (800 Langdon St.) in **Madison, WI**. For the first time ever, Play Make Learn will have a conference theme to bring together the work of all of the communities that come together for the conference. The 2025 Play Make Learn Conference theme is:

![Breaking and Mending: Exploring Messiness, Creativity, and Transformation in Education](https://dpi.wi.gov/sites/default/files/imce/play-make-learn/images/BreakingAndMending.jpg)

Innovations in educational design and play-based learning often emerge from moments of critical reflection, experimentation, and creative risk-taking. By embracing the processes of breaking and mending, we can foster enhanced inclusivity, deeper relevance in teaching and learning practices, and greater belonging in educational spaces. This year’s conference theme invites educators, researchers, scholars, librarians, and practitioners to critically examine the acts of breaking and mending as pathways to systemic transformation, resilience, and creative growth. Whether through playful experimentation, critical deconstruction, or thoughtful rebuilding, we explore how “messiness” can lead to meaningful change and stronger, more human-centered learning environments.

*Play Make Learn is hosted by the UW-Madison School of Education’s Department of Curriculum and Instruction and the office of Professional Learning and Community Education (PLACE). This partnership was made possible by the generosity of the School of Education’s Impact 2030 Initiative. The conference is also sponsored by the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction, and is made possible in part by funding from the Institute of Museum and Library Services.*

Notifications about session proposals will be sent out in April 2025. More information about the Call for Proposals is below.

**Session "Strands"**: Submissions are encouraged in and across the following themes, but new ideas are also welcome and encouraged. You will be asked to select all themes that apply to your work:

- Playful learning
- Games for learning and positive social impact
- Making and makerspaces
- STEAM education
- Arts in education

**Session Format:** You will be asked to select the session format. Please note time and maximum presenters for each type.

- **Hands-on Workshops (***75 minutes, 1-6 presenters***)**: Workshops should actively engage participants, showcasing your work, or methods you use inside or outside the classroom. They may include physical making, playing a game or something else. Session Organizers will be asked for 2-3 learning goals or takeaways they have for participants in the session.
- **Panel Presentation (***75 minutes, 2-4 presenters***)**: Panel presentations should have two or more presenters from different projects or organizations. Panels should explore a “big question” relevant to the conference theme or of interest to the larger PML community. Session Organizers will be asked for 2-3 learning goals or takeaways they have for participants in the session.
- **Individual Presentation (***15 minutes, 1-2 presenters***)**: Presentations will be 15 minutes in length to highlight noteworthy initiatives, ideas, or recent research. Session Organizers will be asked for 1 learning goal or takeaways they have for participants from their presentation. The planning committee will group individual presentations into themed 75 minute sessions with a moderator, who will reach out to coordinate the final format with presenters.
- **Poster:** Posters provide the opportunity to present innovative ideas, initiatives, and prototypes in both formal and informal learning contexts. Presenters will have space to hang their poster and engage with attendees during the interactive poster & playful demo session.
- **Playful Demo:** This interactive, open-ended session is a chance to show off or playtest a game, ed tech tool, or other innovation. Presenters will have a table for their activity or tool during the interactive poster & playful demo session.
- **Break the Mold Session:** Have an idea that doesn’t quite fit into the formats listed above? Samples include sessions lasting days or weeks asynchronously, sessions within games and so on. What if a session took place in Minecraft? What if participants met outside to explore? What if participants worked collaboratively over the conference to produce a play? Be as creative as you dare for these sessions. If you have questions about an idea before submitting, send an email to [**conferences@education.wisc.edu**](http://conferences@education.wisc.edu/).

**Final Notes:**

- In the interest of providing diverse perspectives any individual will be limited to participating in a maximum of two sessions. Posters and Arcade Demos do not count towards this maximum.
- Sessions should focus on new insights, learnings and innovations of broad interest to the PML community and should not be promotional in nature. If you are a for-profit company interested in showcasing your product to the PML audience, please reach out to [**conferences@education.wisc.edu**](http://conferences@education.wisc.edu/) for sponsorship opportunities.

If you have any other questions, feel free to email Chris Baker, Public Library Consultant with the DPI Library Services Team at [**Chris.Baker@dpi.wi.gov**](https://dpi.wi.gov/).
