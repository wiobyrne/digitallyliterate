# Setting the Table

## What You Should Know About LLMs Before We Begin

## Key Points:
Before we dive in, there’s something important we need to talk about — something most people skip over when they start using tools like ChatGPT or Grok.

Large Language Models (LLMs) are **tools**, not oracles. They don’t “know” truth. They don’t “have” opinions. What they give you is a response generated by pattern recognition — built from massive amounts of text, shaped by their training data, and influenced by how their creators told them to behave.

That’s not a reason to distrust them — it’s a reason to **understand** them. Just like any tool, you need to know what it’s built for, where its blind spots might be, and how to use it responsibly.

## These tools reflect the choices of their creators.

LLMs reflect:

- The **data they were trained on** (websites, books, Reddit, Wikipedia, news, etc.)
- The **values and intentions** of their designers (what they’re allowed to say or not say)
- The **guardrails** imposed after training (e.g., OpenAI’s or xAI’s alignment policies)

Even if an LLM says it’s “neutral,” it’s still operating within a framework of choices made by human beings. And just like with anything human-made — bias comes with the territory.

So if you ask a question and the answer rubs you the wrong way, the issue might be the facts. But it might also be how the tool was trained to respond.

## Everyone has bias. That’s not the problem — unexamined bias is.

Your uncle has bias. So does your favorite news source. So do you. The goal here isn’t to pretend we’re all objective — it’s to **recognize** those biases and account for them, just like you’d factor in wind speed when aiming a long-range shot.

It’s like investing. If someone comes to you with a hot tip about camel-skin lampshades being the next big thing, your first question shouldn’t be “What’s the ROI?” — it should be **“Why is this guy telling me this?”** Is he trying to help you get rich? Or is he trying to move your money into his own pocket?

You have to apply the same critical lens to LLMs. They’re not “lying,” but they’re trained to give useful, safe, approved answers — and that often reflects **institutional, cultural, or political assumptions** baked into their design.

## We’re not just using one LLM — we’re using multiple.

This is one of the key ways we’ll manage for bias. You’ll be asked to use **at least two different LLMs** — for example, ChatGPT and Grok. These tools are trained differently, operate under different corporate philosophies, and often give you very different perspectives on the same question.

Yes, this takes more effort. But it also gives you something incredibly valuable: **perspective**.

If you lean conservative and worry that OpenAI leans left, that’s fine — include Grok in your analysis. If you lean liberal and think Musk has an agenda, include ChatGPT. The goal here isn’t to *trust* any single system — it’s to use multiple tools to **triangulate truth**.

And if you see two or three different LLMs saying the same thing — even when they weren’t designed to agree — that’s usually a signal worth paying attention to.

## I’ll be transparent. I ask that you do the same.

My job here is to **design the prompts carefully**, guide the process thoughtfully, and show you what the systems return — without spin. I’ll tell you exactly what I asked and why. You’ll see the results yourself. You can run the prompts directly if you want to check the math.

All I ask is that you come with a curious, skeptical mind — and try to look at the world through a wide-angle lens.

Next up, in Post 5B, we’ll cover a few key things to keep in mind before you start asking questions. But for now, just remember:

- LLMs are tools
- Tools reflect the people who built them
- And you’re about to learn how to use them with clarity, caution, and confidence
