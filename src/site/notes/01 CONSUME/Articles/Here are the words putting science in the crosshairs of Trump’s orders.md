# Here are the words putting science in the crosshairs of Trump’s orders

## Key Points:
“Women.” “Diverse.” “Institutional.” “Historically.”

At the National Science Foundation, staff have been combing through thousands of active science research projects, alongside a list of keywords, to determine if they include activities that violate executive orders President [Donald Trump](https://www.washingtonpost.com/donald-trump/) issued in his first week in office. Those include orders to [recognize only two genders](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025-01-29/trump-trans-executive-orders-fear-confusion/) and roll back [diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025-01-22/federal-workers-trump-remote-work/). The search is driven by dozens of flagged words, according to an internal document reviewed by The Washington Post and two NSF employees with knowledge of the review process who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak.

## Summary:
National Science Foundation staff have been combing through thousands of active science research projects, alongside a list of keywords, to determine if they include activities that violate Trump’s executive orders.
