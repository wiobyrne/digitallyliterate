Rabia Yasmeen is a senior consultant for Euromonitor International based in Dubai, UAE. This essay is her written response in January 2025 to the question, “How might expanding interactions between humans and AI affect what many people view today as ‘core human traits and behaviors’?” It was published in the 2025 research study “ Being Human in 2035. ”

“ **Let me propose a scenario: *Imagine that it is 2035*.** Humans’ dependence on AI has redefined the essence of being human. Every human boasts a personalized AI assistant, and a stream of agentic workflows not only seamlessly handles 75% of the administration of their daily life but also co-creates their life goals and manages their lifestyles. From booking appointments and ordering groceries to sending heartfelt, automated messages to loved ones, these AI companions are ensuring life runs on autopilot.

“Back in 2025, digital avatars were relatively new with then Gen Z’ers developing their AI avatars for social profiles. However, over the past 10 years this trend has revolutionized social interactions, especially online. Every human in 2035 has a digital twin. Most choose to use it for social media however it has also gained roots in managing appearances at work. Today, many humans are leveraging AI-powered digital twins for delivering presentations and even having a one-on-one with their managers. ‘Out of office’ is not really a thing today, as AI assistants and digital twins are managing work needs and communications while humans are away from work. To say that AI is a close partner for most digitally connected humans is not a misstatement.

> **Humans are saving themselves from doing six hours of digital chores daily. That’s a game-changing 2,190 hours saved annually, equivalent to 91 full days of reclaimed time. Most people are embracing a lifestyle renaissance, channeling their energy into what truly matters to them. … A rise in human consciousness and deeper personal awareness is being achieved as humans reduce direct usage of digital devices and shift this energy to spiritual, emotional and experiential aspects of life. To say, that humans have evolved from intelligence to enlightenment is one way to express this shift**.

“Because their AI can stand in as a proxy to accomplishing the many life tasks, humans have been able to embrace all aspects of their fuller existence more deeply than ever before. When 75% of people’s daily life administration is managed by AI-powered assistants and agents what is the result? Humans are saving themselves from doing six hours of digital chores daily. Tasks that once forced people to spend precious hours on smartphones and laptops in 2025 are delegated to efficient AI counterparts. That’s a game-changing 2,190 hours saved annually, equivalent to 91 full days of reclaimed time.

“Due to their newfound freedom, most people are embracing a lifestyle renaissance, channeling their energy into what truly matters to them: exploring the world, reconnecting with nature and cherishing time with family. The AI-powered era has not only streamlined life but it has also reignited humanity’s passion for the real, tangible experiences that make life meaningful.

“The most noteworthy development taking place as a result of this shift is the rise in the focus on and exploration of human consciousness and deeper universal connection. This ancient trait had been relatively dormant but a rise in human consciousness and deeper personal awareness is being achieved as humans reduce direct usage of digital devices and shift this energy to spiritual, emotional and experiential aspects of life. To say, that humans have evolved from intelligence to enlightenment is one way to express this shift.

> **The expanding interactions between humans and AI have resulted in a continuous reevaluation of core human traits, emphasizing adaptability, empathy and a sense of purpose. …All of this has not come without a price. Humans have become highly dependent on this technology, especially in areas of value generation for the economy. The agency of AI over value creation is a continued social and economic debate. … Global discourse is focused on the potential decentralization of AI systems to create better equality and opportunity for all as AI companies hold most of the economic and political power. However … the deeper integration of AI in human life has reached a point of no segregation.**

“These changes have a profound impact on the social, economic and political landscape. There is greater focus in society on building up and developing human skills that literature termed as ‘soft skills’ back in 2025. These are empathy, connection, listening, creativity and communication. As AI has taken on various responsibilities to manage tasks that require basic intelligence, humans are concentrating on exercising their soft skills such as how to connect with other humans.

“Refining the human tasks performed by AI to fit human life and interactions has heightened humans’ awareness of their presence and led to greater exercise of more-intuitive human capabilities. The expanding interactions between humans and AI have resulted in a continuous reevaluation of core human traits, emphasizing adaptability, empathy and a sense of purpose.

“Because AGI has already been developed for general healthcare, most agents are highly specialized in offering medical assistance. AI agents join senior surgeons in surgeries. Due to this development, in 2034 doctors reported a 40% increase in finding donor matches and completing successful organ transplants.

“Over the last decade, AIs have become humans’ closest companions and confidants. While mental health challenges were high due to complex environments in 2025, humans have since used AI platforms to access individualized counselling and therapy. AI platforms have also helped improve human cognitive and emotional development.

> **All of this has not come without a price. … Humans have become highly dependent on this technology. … The agency of AI systems over value creation is a continued social and economic debate. … The number of incidents tied to privacy violations, distribution of misinformation and digital fraud are at their peak in human history. Humans are dependent on AI to establish safety nets and measures to mitigate these risks. The technology is the universal resource at the forefront of managing political, social and economic developments. In essence, the deeper integration of AI in human life has reached a point of no segregation.**

“All of this has not come without a price. As AI has been used to improve lives, foster creativity and help mitigate global challenges, humans have become highly dependent on this technology especially in areas of value generation for the economy. Technology and economic experts continue to predict unforeseen developments that may lead to the breakdown of today’s widespread digitally crafted economic system. The agency of AI systems over value creation is a continued social and economic debate. The most-advanced countries continue to reap most of the economic benefits of technology.

“While the economic gap between developing and developed countries has decreased somewhat due to the implementation of AI systems, due to the lower literacy rates and higher unemployment rates in many developing countries AI has had less impact on those economies. These countries have been able to harness some of the exponential benefit of AI systems to improve services, however they still lack controls and infrastructure to manage this change.

“Much global discourse in 2035 has been focused on the potential decentralization of AI systems to create better equality and opportunity for all. As AI now holds substantial human data on personal, business and political fronts, AI companies hold most of the economic and political power. However, it may be too late to change.

“The number of incidents tied to privacy violations, distribution of misinformation and digital fraud are at their peak in human history. Humans are dependent on AI to establish safety nets and measures to mitigate these risks. The technology is the universal resource at the forefront of managing political, social and economic developments. In essence, the deeper integration of AI in human life has reached a point of no segregation.”
