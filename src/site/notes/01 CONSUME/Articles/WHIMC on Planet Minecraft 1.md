# WHIMC on Planet Minecraft 1

## Key Points:
- ## About
	WHIMC is a National Science Foundation-funded research project and interdisciplinary collaboration between [several organizations](https://whimcproject.web.illinois.edu/about/affiliations/) dedicated to cutting-edge and impactful informal learning in STEM.  
	  
	The goal of WHIMC is to develop computer simulations that engage, excite, and generate interest and engagement in STEM. WHIMC leverages Minecraft Java Edition as a learning environment for learners to interactively explore the scientific consequences of alternative versions of Earth via “what if?” questions, such as “What if the earth had no moon?” Kids get to explore these as aspiring scientists and engineers on an interactive server ( [which you can join](https://whimcproject.web.illinois.edu/sign-up-for-our-server/)!) that changes to match their interests.
