# Ensuring Your Privacy in These Interesting Times

# Some Practical Privacy Advice (Aka: Tin-Foil Hat Time)

Okay gang, here’s where I feel like I’m putting on my tin-foil hat.

But I have an obligation to you — even though I’ve never met a single one of you. I believe in a social contract, and rule #1 is: **never do anything that causes — or could cause — harm to others.**

In a truly dystopian world — where a dictator comes to power, civil liberties end, and a full surveillance state is implemented — **everything you do online could be monitored, logged, and analyzed by AI**.

That data will likely be stored in massive systems operated by companies like Palantir (which is, not incidentally, ~50% owned by Peter Thiel, and Palantir will be doing this as a profit-generating business selling services to the new government. _This is_ **_not_** _a charity!_)

Now, let me be clear: You’re probably _not_ in any danger just for asking the questions I suggest in this project.

But if the government ever compels big tech companies or LLM providers to hand over historical query logs, there’s a **non-zero risk** that your past questions and activity could be used against you. AI systems could easily be trained to flag users as “disloyal,” “extremist,” or “high risk” — and once that happens, you could end up on a list. And lists, historically, don’t end well.

So here’s what I suggest — **not out of fear, but out of caution**:

# Basic Steps to Protect Your Privacy

- **Use a VPN** before doing any politically sensitive research or asking controversial queries. This masks your IP address and encrypts your traffic. It’s not perfect, but it’s a big step toward anonymity.
- **Log out of your accounts** (especially Google, Facebook, Microsoft, etc.) before using LLMs or browsing political material. If possible, use a browser where you’re not logged in to anything.
- **Open a private or Incognito window** in your browser. While this doesn’t hide your IP, it prevents cookies and login info from following you around during your session.
- **Use a throwaway email** if you need to create accounts for LLM tools or anything privacy-sensitive. You can use services like ProtonMail, Tutanota, or create a temporary email at sites like Maildrop or 10MinuteMail. Just make sure you don’t tie that email to any personal identifying information.
- **Don’t reuse passwords.** And consider using a password manager (like Bitwarden or 1Password) to generate secure logins you don’t have to remember.

# I’m Not Perfect Either

I’m not an [[OpSec\|OpSec]]  expert, and I don’t follow all of this perfectly myself.

**It’s a pain in the ass.** I’m busy. And I’ve been operating without OpSec for so long I’m probably fucked anyway if things really got… interesting.

But I do believe in telling people the truth — even when I don’t model it as well as I should. And that inclues that you really, really should cover your own ass.

This isn’t paranoia.

It’s awareness.

And it’s a simple way to protect yourself in case things take a darker turn.

Stay safe.

Stay free.
