# Do Not Obey In Advance

## Key Points:
[Speaking of](https://kottke.org/25/02/we-are-hurtling-towards-having-a-russian-type-regime) Timothy Snyder, Literary Hub [published the first chapter](https://lithub.com/resist-authoritarianism-by-refusing-to-obey-in-advance/) (the one on not obeying in advance) of his 2017 book [On Tyranny](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0804190119/ref=nosim/0sil8). It begins:

> Do not obey in advance.
> 
> Most of the power of authoritarianism is freely given. In times like these, individuals think ahead about what a more repressive government will want, and then offer themselves without being asked. A citizen who adapts in this way is teaching power what it can do.
> 
> Anticipatory obedience is a political tragedy. Perhaps rulers did not initially know that citizens were willing to compromise this value or that principle. Perhaps a new regime did not at first have the direct means of influencing citizens one way or another. After the German elections of 1932, which permitted Adolf Hitler to form a government, or the Czechoslovak elections of 1946, where communists were victorious, the next crucial step was anticipatory obedience. Because enough people in both cases voluntarily extended their services to the new leaders, Nazis and communists alike realized that they could move quickly toward a full regime change. The first heedless acts of conformity could not then be reversed.

Itâ€™s also worth reading the original list posted by Snyder in November 2016 that became the basis of On Tyranny: [Fighting Authoritarianism: 20 Lessons from the 20th Century](https://kottke.org/16/11/fighting-authoritarianism-20-lessons-from-the-20th-century).

> 10\. Practice corporeal politics. Power wants your body softening in your chair and your emotions dissipating on the screen. Get outside. Put your body in unfamiliar places with unfamiliar people. Make new friends and march with them.
> 
> 11\. Make eye contact and small talk. This is not just polite. It is a way to stay in touch with your surroundings, break down unnecessary social barriers, and come to understand whom you should and should not trust. If we enter a culture of denunciation, you will want to know the psychological landscape of your daily life.
> 
> 12\. Take responsibility for the face of the world. Notice the swastikas and the other signs of hate. Do not look away and do not get used to them. Remove them yourself and set an example for others to do so.
> 
> 13\. Hinder the one-party state. The parties that took over states were once something else. They exploited a historical moment to make political life impossible for their rivals. Vote in local and state elections while you can.
