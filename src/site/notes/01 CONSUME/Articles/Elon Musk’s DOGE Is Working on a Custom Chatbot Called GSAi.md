# Elon Musk’s DOGE Is Working on a Custom Chatbot Called GSAi

## Key Points:
DOGE’s AI initiatives dovetail with the group’s efforts to reduce the federal budget and speed up existing processes. For instance, DOGE members at the Department of Education are reportedly using AI tools to analyze spending and programs, The Washington Post [reported on Thursday](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/02/06/elon-musk-doge-ai-department-education/). A department spokesperson says that the focus is on finding cost efficiencies.

The General Services Administration’s GSAi chatbot project could bring similar benefits, enabling workers, as an example, to draft memos faster. The agency had hoped to use existing software such as Google Gemini, but ultimately determined that it wouldn’t provide the level of data DOGE desired, according to one of the people familiar with the project. Google spokesperson Jose Castañeda declined to comment.

It’s not the only DOGE AI ambition that hasn’t panned out. On Monday, Shedd described deploying “AI coding agents” as among the agency’s top priorities, according to remarks described to WIRED. These agents help engineers [automatically generate, edit, and answer questions about software code](https://www.wired.com/story/fast-forward-ai-rewiring-coders-brains-github-copilot/) in hopes of boosting productivity and reducing errors. One tool the team looked into, according to documents viewed by WIRED, was Cursor, a coding assistant developed by Anysphere, a fast-growing San Francisco startup.

Anysphere’s leading investors include Thrive Capital and [Andreessen Horowitz](https://a16z.com/announcement/investing-in-cursor/)—both of which have connections to Trump. Joshua Kushner, Thrive’s managing partner, [has historically made](https://www.businessinsider.com/josh-kushner-jared-brother-beto-orourkes-senate-campaign-donation-2019-3) political campaign donations to Democrats, but he is the brother of Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner. Andreessen cofounder Marc Andreessen [has said he’s advising](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/17/opinion/marc-andreessen-trump-silicon-valley.html) Trump on tech and energy policy.

A different person familiar with the General Services Administration’s technology purchases says the IT team at the agency had initially approved the use of Cursor, only to retract it later for further review. Now, DOGE is pushing to install Microsoft’s [GitHub Copilot](https://www.wired.com/story/openai-copilot-autocomplete-for-code/), the world’s most well-known coding assistant, according to the other person familiar with the agency.

Cursor and the General Services Administration did not respond to requests for comment. [Andreessen Horowitz](https://a16z.com/announcement/investing-in-cursor/) and Thrive declined to comment.

[Federal regulations](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/part-3) require avoiding even the appearance of a conflict of interest in the choice of suppliers. And while there haven’t been any known widespread concerns about Cursor’s security, federal agencies [are generally required by law](https://csrc.nist.gov/topics/laws-and-regulations/laws/FISMA) to study potential cybersecurity risks before adopting new technology.

The federal government’s interest and use of AI isn’t new. In October 2023, then president Biden [ordered the General Services Administration](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/11/01/2023-24283/safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence) to prioritize security reviews for several categories of AI tools, including chatbots and coding assistants. But by the end of his term, none had made it through even the preliminary agency review processes, according to a former official familiar with them. As a result, no dedicated AI-assisted coding tools have received authorization [under FedRAMP](https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/products?status=authorized), a GSA program to centralize security reviews and ease the burden on individual agencies.

Though the Biden prioritization process didn’t bear fruit, several individual agencies have explored licensing AI software. In transparency reports published during Biden’s term in office, the [Commerce](https://www.commerce.gov/about/policies/artificial-intelligence-use-cases-inventory), [Homeland Security](https://www.dhs.gov/ai/use-case-inventory), [Interior](https://www.doi.gov/ai/use-case-inventory), [State](https://2021-2025.state.gov/department-of-state-ai-inventory-2024/), and [Veterans Affairs](https://department.va.gov/ai/ai-use-case-inventory/) departments all reported they were pursuing the use of AI coding tools, including in some cases GitHub Copilot and [Google’s Gemini](https://www.usaspending.gov/award/CONT_AWD_72MC1024P00033_7200_-NONE-_-NONE-). GSA itself [had been](https://www.gsa.gov/technology/government-it-initiatives/artificial-intelligence/how-were-using-ai/ai-use-case-inventory) exploring three limited-purpose chatbots, including for handling IT service requests.

## Summary:
The chatbot is part of Elon Musk and President Donald Trump’s ambitions to use AI and other technologies to cut costs and modernize the US government.
