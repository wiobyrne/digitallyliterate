# Civics Education Helps Create Young Voters and Activists

## Key Points:
It’s widely known that young adults in the United States tend to vote at lower rates than older Americans, but it’s easy to gloss over just how stunning the numbers really are—especially at a time of such intense political polarization and divisiveness. [Only half of eligible adults between the ages of 18 and 29](https://civicyouth.org/quick-facts/youth-voting/) voted in the 2016 presidential election that sent Donald Trump to the White House. During the 2014 midterm elections two years earlier, the youth-voter-turnout rate was just 20 percent, the lowest ever recorded in history, [according to an analysis of Census data](https://civicyouth.org/2014-youth-turnout-and-youth-registration-rates-lowest-ever-recorded-changes-essential-in-2016/).

These troubling voting rates follow decades of declining civics education. Starting in the 1960s, [robust civics instruction](https://www.carnegie.org/media/filer_public/ab/dd/abdda62e-6e84-47a4-a043-348d2f2085ae/ccny_grantee_2011_guardian.pdf), which usually took place through three standard high-school courses, started to atrophy. It’s likely not a coincidence, then, given evidence [suggesting](https://civicyouth.org/high-school-civic-education-linked-to-voting-participation-and-political-knowledge-no-effect-on-partisanship-or-candidate-selection/) a link between civics education and voter participation, that the 1960s [coincided with a slump](https://www.census.gov/prod/2014pubs/p20-573.pdf) in the rate of young adults who cast ballots.

## Summary:
Youth voter turnout is notoriously low in the U.S., especially when social-studies classes are notably absent.
