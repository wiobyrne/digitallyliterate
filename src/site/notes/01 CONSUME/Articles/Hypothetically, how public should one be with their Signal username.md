# Hypothetically, how public should one be with their Signal username

## Key Points:
Yes, I know it's practically your phone number. But if I think about how (relatively) easy it is find someone online, why then would someone's Signal account (especially if you block your phone number from being seen) be all that more necessary to keep private over social media dm's/pm's?

> Usernames are safer for public display because they're instantly disposable - swap 'em in & out as often as you like. If you have any unwanted attention that can't be solved by blocking an individual number / username, it's trivial to change your username & adopt a fresh Signal identity.
> 
> Contacts that have your Signal phone number saved in their contacts directory will retain their connection, nothing changes for them. You'll retain all your contacts information, but those who only have your username will no longer be able to find you by username alone.

> If you meet someone and you want to chat with them on signal but you don't want them to know your phone number, give them your username. If you want to solicit people to contact you on signal by posting your information somewhere but you don't want to post your phone number, post your signal username. If you ever come to regret doing so, remove or change the username, it's free and much less of a hassle than changing your phone number.
