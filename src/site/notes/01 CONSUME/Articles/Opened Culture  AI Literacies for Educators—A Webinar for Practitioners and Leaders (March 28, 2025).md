## AI Literacies for Educators—A Webinar for Practitioners and Leaders (March 28, 2025)

##### WEBINAR

## An Exploration of AI Literacies for National AI Literacy Day

Artificial intelligence is rapidly transforming every facet of education, both for learners, educators, and leaders alike. In this time of great change, how can we equip our learners (and ourselves) with the skills necessary to navigate and influence the evolving landscape of artificial intelligence?

Join Dr. Angela Gunder of [Opened Culture](https://openedculture.org/) and Dr. Doug Belshaw of [We Are Open](https://weareopen.coop/) in this free, interactive workshop as they unveil the multifaceted and transformative world of "AI Literacies." Recognizing that literacy is not merely an on/off switch of literacy vs. illiteracy, but a spectrum of interconnected and evolving skills, this online session will introduce educators of all levels and contexts to eight different dimensions of competencies, skills, and mindsets that comprise AI literacies.

##### Friday, March 28, 2025 ● 10:00 AM ET/8:00 AM PT

#### About the Webinar

Pulling from findings from a commissioned research study by [UNESCO IITE](https://iite.unesco.org/) and [Shanghai Open University](https://global.sou.edu.cn/), the virtual workshop will provide a foundational understanding of AI literacies, emphasizing their critical role in education today. Dr. Gunder and Dr. Belshaw will explore the critical, creative, and communicative dimensions of using generative AI in classrooms, guiding participants through the implications and opportunities it presents.

The conversation will feature insights from Dr. Punya Mishra and Dr. Ian O’Byrne. Additionally, friends from [D2L](https://www.d2l.com/) and [EDUCAUSE](https://www.educause.edu/) will join in on the festivities for National AI Literacy Day. And at the end of the session, participants will be invited to join a free mini-course called [AI Literacies Unlocked](https://openedculture.org/learning/course-ai-literacies-unlocked/), hosted in D2L Brightspace and freely available to educators across the globe.

This workshop is designed to engage educators at all levels, particularly those new to the concept of AI literacies, in developing strategies to help their students succeed in an AI-enabled world.

#### Outcomes

Key takeaways for participants will include:

- Unpacking AI literacies as a dynamic set of skills vital for both educators and students.
- Developing strategies to integrate and teach AI literacies across a wide variety of educational settings.
- Gaining access to a new open course in D2L Brightspace highlighting the application of AI literacies.
