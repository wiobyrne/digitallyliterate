**Overview**

On behalf of the New York Life Foundation, the Afterschool Alliance invites out-of-school time (OST) programs to apply for a competitive grant to support and bolster their ability to help prepare middle school students in low-income and disadvantaged communities for success in high school and beyond.

**Why Middle School?** 

Research shows that middle school and the transition from 8<sup>th</sup> to 9<sup>th</sup> grade has a significant impact on students’ long-term academic trajectory. Enriching OST programs—such as afterschool and summer learning programs—are an effective means of helping middle school students successfully transition from 8<sup>th</sup> to 9<sup>th</sup> grade. Programs provide academic benefits, support students’ well-being, and help youth develop the skills they need to thrive—cognitively, socially, and emotionally. The New York Life Foundation’s educational enhancement grantmaking strategy aims to provide opportunities that help students in middle school thrive and become better prepared to complete high school and go on to college, providing them with a brighter future. As youth in low-income and disadvantaged communities have less access to OST programs, Aim High grants focus on youth in these communities.

**Why was the Aim High Program created?**

The New York Life Foundation created the Aim High grant program to help local community-based afterschool and summer learning programs support middle school students from low-income and disadvantaged communities with the critical transition to high school.

**The Aim High Grant Program**

15 one-year grants of $20,000 and 15 two-year grants of $100,000 will be awarded. **Awardees must be nonprofit organizations serving middle school youth, with at least 75% of those served from families with low incomes. Programs can only apply for one of these grants**. One-year grants will begin in August 2025 and end in August 2026. The two-year grants will begin in August 2025 and end in August 2027.

**One-Year Grants:**

15 one-year, $20,000 general operating grants will be awarded to programs that demonstrate successful student engagement strategies and have strong impact data. Unlike in previous years, applicants for the one-year grants will not have to meet a specific focus or theme. Funding must be dedicated to a middle school OST program that serves low-income or disadvantaged communities and provides support for the transition to high school.

**Two-Year Grants:**

15 two-year grants of $100,000 will be awarded to middle school programs to support efforts that help reduce school absences and chronic absenteeism, which has a strong impact on educational attainment. Programs must serve low-income or disadvantaged communities, and address how they support youth in the transition to high school.
