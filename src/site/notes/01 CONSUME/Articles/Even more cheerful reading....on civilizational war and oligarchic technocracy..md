# Even more cheerful reading....on civilizational war and oligarchic technocracy.

## Key Points:
I hesitate to add to the ongoing flow of negativity in the infosphere,  but I will pass on my edited ChatGPT 4o summaries of articles by [Venkatesh Rao](https://substack.com/@contraptions/note/c-92075078?r=6x6l6) and [Timothy Snyder](https://snyder.substack.com/p/the-logic-of-destruction?r=6x6l6&triedRedirect=true).  I think they describe our situation in appropriately dire terms.  

Rao argues that contemporary U.S. politics has shifted from a “culture war” to a “civilizational war,” and suggests that Trump and Musk’s faction has undergone this shift by becoming more disciplined and warlike, while Democrats remain stuck in an outdated, ineffective culture-war mode. Unlike culture wars, which are low-intensity conflicts centered on optics and social skirmishes, civilizational wars resemble historical steppe-nomad conquests—high-tempo, ruthless, and strategically destructive. The piece draws parallels to the 30 Years’ War and Mongol tactics, suggesting that modern “warriors” operate in a decentralized, open-source insurgency mode, using social media as a kind of continuous intoxication (akin to fermented mare’s milk for nomads) to stay engaged and aggressive. The author critiques mainstream political analysis for misunderstanding this shift, misinterpreting legal checks and media discourse as signs of normalcy rather than symptoms of deeper conflict. Ultimately, they suggest this is a negative-sum war that cannot be stopped, only mitigated.

Snyder describes the U.S. ias undergoing an oligarchic coup aimed at dismantling democracy and concentrating power among a wealthy elite. It asserts that the current executive branch rejects the idea of America as a nation governed by its people and instead seeks to create disorder to strengthen its control. The systematic discrediting of government institutions, demonization of federal workers, and elevation of billionaires as heroes have paved the way for this takeover. The destruction is intentional, with no plan to govern—only to create chaos that justifies authoritarian rule. The author likens Trump’s tariffs, attacks on allies, and deportation spectacles to deliberate strategies designed to impoverish, divide, and weaken Americans while enriching a select few. The removal of experienced officials in law enforcement and intelligence, under the guise of ideological purges, aims to eliminate those who could resist lawlessness. The article warns that unless citizens act decisively—through legal challenges, state-level resistance, impeachment efforts, and corporate pushback—the country will descend into an anti-democratic system where oligarchs manipulate markets and power unchecked. The call to action is urgent: people must organize, resist demoralization, and recognize that self-governance requires collective action beyond just voting.
