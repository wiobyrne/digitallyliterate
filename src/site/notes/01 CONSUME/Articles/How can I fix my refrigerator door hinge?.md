# How can I fix my refrigerator door hinge?

## Key Points:
Just moved into our new home and realized last night that one of the doors on our refrigerator is not closing properly.

On the bottom of the door it looks like some plastic trim has broken off. That trim is partially responsible for holding in place the socket that fits onto and pivots around the door cam. The cam is affixed to the hinge below and the whole door rests on top if it.

There's also a big cavity in the bottom of the door where it looks like some insulating foam has been ripped out of, I think the socket piece rested in there and was held in place by the foam and the plastic trim. Now it just flops around inside the cavity.

This is the right side door on a Maytag MFB2055FRZ00. I've looked at some parts websites and unfortunately it looks like all the hinge parts on the door side are not available individually, only the parts that attach to the fridge itself. If I want to fix this with original parts I think I would need to buy a whole new door for $600+.

Broken bottom hinge

I think if I can fill this cavity with some kind of material to hold the socket in place that might fix the problem. I tried some spray foam this morning and it worked for a bit but didn't hold up very long. I might try again with spray foam and let it cure longer (only cured about 30m this time) but I'm doubtful it will be strong enough long term.

Is there something else I can fill the cavity with that will harden up strong enough to do the job? Some kind of epoxy maybe?

> I would think you need something harder than spray foam. If that worked for a bit you know you are on the right track. Epoxy might be the answer. Some epoxies dissolve foam so be aware. I’d probably dig out the spray foam and see if you can get a piece of existing insulation and test with epoxy you choose. Then I’d put some filler material in there like pieces of wood or metal so it’s not a giant hole to fill. Some epoxies heat up a lot while curing and could maybe warp or damage your door. Read label and research. You may find doing a few small pours better than one big one.

I think filling it with epoxy would probably work, I’m just not sure if the epoxy would get too hot and damage the surrounding foam as it cured.
