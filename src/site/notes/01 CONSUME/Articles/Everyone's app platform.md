Expand for detail and directions: This tracker presents information on NSF grants that have been prematurely terminated since January 20, 2025. Please disseminate as wildly as possible among your networks to inform, organize, and advocate. Please also encourage your networks to report their terminated grants using the link in the upper right-hand corner of this page. Researchers with terminated grants may want to refer to this guide from AAUPâ€™s Center for the Defense of Academic Freedom. TO EXPLORE THE DATA: Select "Grid" view on the drop-down menu on the righthand side to see more fields and get totals and subtotals of any search or grouping. Use "Group", "Filter", and "Sort" on the right to explore and analyze the data. Click on any grant row (in "List" view), or the Grant number (in "Grid" view), to see expanded on the grant. This tracker is maintained by Noam Ross of rOpenSci and Scott Delaney of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Information in this tracker comes primarily from principal investigators and other scientists who submit terminated grant numbers and other information using the submission form in the upper righthand corner of this page. We also supplement user-submitted information with data from Federal databases, including USASpending and NSF award search. When possible, we cross-reference data from multiple sources to ensure accuracy, but there is uncertainty in data shared and published. For corrections or questions, contact Scott Delaney on Signal at sdelaney.84. This effort builds on a separate tracker we created terminated NIH grants, which is viewable here. --- A NOTE OF CAUTION: We expect the NSF grant termination process to be extraordinarily chaotic, as has been the case with NIH grant terminations. In some cases, POs at NSF and PIs may receive conflicting information, and the government may provide incorrect or shifting information (knowingly or not) about exactly which grants were terminated, when, and why. Thus, data presented here are an effort to organize and clarify some of this uncertainty. However, given the chaotic nature of the moment, our dataset may contain some inaccuracies. Please contact us with questions or corrections.
