# Steps to Success when building a Community of Practice

## Key Points:
## Overview

This post outlines different types of work that needs to take place when planning, sustaining, and developing a Community of Practice. It is informed by work that [WAO](https://weareopen.coop/) have carried out with [Participate](https://participate.com/) around the [Keep Badges Weird](https://badges.community/) community over the last 10 months.

The stages outlined below taken from an evolution of the work around a [maturity model for online, networked communities](https://blog.weareopen.coop/towards-a-maturity-model-for-online-networked-communities-v0-1-7c78c2bee8d5) and [systems convening for breaking boundaries](https://blog.weareopen.coop/keep-badges-weird-is-about-breaking-boundaries-42afb0415826). We found that a space flight metaphor resonated more deeply than the previous one we were using, and so we have continued with as our work has developed.

The above image plots â€˜energy and visibilityâ€™ against â€˜phasesâ€™ through with the community moves. Like rockets, communities need to reach escape velocity to avoid crashing back down to earth. It takes as much energy to sustain and develop communities as it does to initiate them.

This image uses the work of Etienne and Beverly Wenger-Trayner around systems convening, and maps it against stages of development taken from our space flight metaphor.

Weâ€™ll dig into each section in the main detail of the post, but itâ€™s worth pointing out that all of these types of work are important in their own right. There are certain times at which they are crucially important, but they need to happen in some form at every stage of community development.

## **a) Pinpoint your people**

- Members have a safe space to meet and communicate
- There is an idea of who the community is for
- Easy onboarding makes it simple to get started

## **b) Do something together**

- There are regular invitations to participate in the community
- Members can get involved in different activities within the community
- There are ways of working openly that allow new members to get involved / catch up

## **c) Get people talking**

- Community members meet regularly using agreed channels and tools
- There are backchannels and watercoolers for varied conversations
- Members are connecting with people they havenâ€™t had the chance to before
