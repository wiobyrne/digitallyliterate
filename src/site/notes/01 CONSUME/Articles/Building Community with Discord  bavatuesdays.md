# Building Community with Discord | bavatuesdays

## Key Points:

Next Tuesday is the start of the free [Reclaim EdTech](https://reclaimed.tech/) Flex Course focused on [building community on the social platform Discord](https://www.reclaimhosting.com/event/flex-course-building-community-with-discord/). In the first episode airing next week on April 4th at 12 PM Eastern [Lauren Hanks](https://laurenhanks.com/) and I will discuss some of the inspirations that led us to using the social platform [Discord](https://discord.com/) in combination with the live streaming service [Streamyard](https://streamyard.com/) to run our sessions for [OERxDomains21](https://oerxdomains21.org/).

MBS’s TV Guide-inspired design for theOERxDomains21 Schedule

That experience was so amazing on so many levels, and it led us to use that same combination soon after to run our Domains Workshop for admins in June of 2021 (still referred to as the [Reclaim Roadshow](https://roadshow.reclaimhosting.com/)). Lauren built out a template for the work she did during OERxDomains21 in Discord, as she will do, and over the course of the next year we used that for our workshops.

Our first full blown virtual workshop after OERxDomains21 integrating Discord and Streamyard to great effect

But we felt like we missing out on some of the potential for more sustained interactions and connections Discord offered, so we started imagining what it might be like to hold more regular events for our community in an always-on Discord server to start getting more intentional about outreach and community building. And in April 2022 a whole new division of EdTech at Reclaim Hosting was born using Discord and Streamyard as our primary means for running regular workshops and flex courses. We learned a lot in our first year and we’re planning on unveiling what’s in store for year two of Reclaim EdTech at [Reclaim Open](https://reclaimopen.com/), but in the interim you should really [join our Discord server](https://reclaimed.tech/discord) next week to see how you, too, can build community in Discord!
