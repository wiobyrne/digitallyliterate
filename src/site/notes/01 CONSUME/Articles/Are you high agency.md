I love following the evolution of language, and *Business Insider* [just published a great piece](https://www.businessinsider.com/high-agency-tech-buzzword-silicon-valley-hiring-2025-2) on a new phrase that has taken over Silicon Valley. People in tech used to call themselves "self-starters," then the term "disruptor" came into vogue. Now, everyone is claiming that they‚Äôre "high agency."

From *[Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/high-agency-tech-buzzword-silicon-valley-hiring-2025-2)*:

> Over the past year, high agency has become *the* aspirational character trait of Silicon Valley. Early last year, the analytics site Brandwatch found there was a 500% jump in mentions of the phrase across X, Reddit, and other social media sites.
> 
> Not one but two podcasts titled "High Agency" have launched, one dedicated to AI, the other to entrepreneurship. On LinkedIn, a wide range of sectors, from solar to crypto, are suddenly seeking ‚Äúhigh-agency‚Äù applicants. And on Substack, tech-culture essayists are schooling readers on how to ratchet up their ‚Äúhigh-agency‚Äù qualities, which are said to be possessed by tech elites and top athletes.
> 
> "High agency" was coined in 2016, when Eric Weinstein, then the managing director of [Peter Thiel's](https://archive.ph/o/NiqqD/https://www.businessinsider.com/peter-thiel) investment firm, referenced it during an appearance on a podcast hosted by the [self-help guru Tim Ferriss](https://archive.ph/o/NiqqD/https://www.businessinsider.com/tim-ferriss-morning-routine-2017-1). In Weinstein's formulation, a high-agency approach to the world is "constantly looking for what is possible, in a kind of MacGyverish sort of a way."
> 
> It's a trait mostly assigned to [people who start their own companies](https://archive.ph/o/NiqqD/https://www.businessinsider.com/confessions-of-a-startup-founder-wife-marriage-tiktok-games-2023-11), seize opportunities that others miss, and never take "no" for an answer. High-agency people are rich, successful, or on their way to being both. They're action-oriented and find opportunities where others see roadblocks.

As the article explains, Americans love phrases and terms that are meant to inspire future hard-working business leaders. Words like grit, type A, and even girlboss all connote an intense drive. The phrase ‚Äúhigh agency‚Äù grates me a bit though. It sounds hyper-individualistic and implies a sort of pull-yourself-up-by-the-bootstraps type mentality. The reality of life in America is that it doesn‚Äôt matter how ‚Äúhigh agency‚Äù you are, you could end up in medical debt and lose your house, or become permanently disabled overnight from catching a virus someone gave to you on the bus to work.

Silicon Valley billionaires like Marc Andreessen talk about ‚Äúhigh agency‚Äù people as if they‚Äôre some superior class and the traits they carry are innate, which reads a bit weird to me considering how fond those people are of eugenics. That said, the phrase does seem to be getting mainstreamed enough already that it won‚Äôt carry those connotations for very long. It is already being fully adopted into the hustle-bro lexicon. You can read the full story on *[Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/high-agency-tech-buzzword-silicon-valley-hiring-2025-2)*.

Over the past week, Elon Musk has been engaged in a near wholesale takeover of key areas of the U.S. federal government. Working under the newly minted "Department of Government Efficiency" aka DOGE, Musk and a group of young Gen Z loyalists have begun wreaking havoc on our institutions.

On [this week‚Äôs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWnDCYQBCds) *[Power User](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWnDCYQBCds)*, Ryan Broderick joins me me to break down who exactly these 19 to 25 year old men are, what their backgrounds reveal about the people Musk is hiring, and what the billionaire is currently doing to the U.S. government.

<iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UWnDCYQBCds?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe>

Since this story broke, one 25 year old DOGE staffer Marko Elez (who is discussed on the pod) [has now resigned](https://www.wsj.com/tech/doge-staffer-resigns-over-racist-posts-d9f11a93) after being linked to a deleted X account that was posting insanely racist stuff including advocating for repealing the Civil Rights Act, enacting a ‚Äúeugenic immigration policy,‚Äù and saying, ‚ÄúYou could not pay me to marry outside of my ethnicity." Think how racist you have to be to get fired by DOGE üòµ‚Äçüí´.

Back in 2016, when I was living in D.C. and covering politics for *The Hill*, I became friends with another reporter named [Miranda Green](https://mirandacgreen.com/). Miranda is a phenomenal journalist and we both ended up in L.A. near each other. Miranda has always been a heads-down worker, focused on breaking major stories and holding power to account. She is a talented, brilliant, and a dogged investigator. She‚Äôs everything a newsroom should want in a journalist.

About a month ago, after a grueling job hunt, she landed a gig as a national investigative reporter at the Huffington Post. It seemed like a great job and I was so happy that she landed somewhere that would support her essential journalistic work.

But yesterday, just one month after she started, [she was laid off](https://x.com/mirandacgreen/status/1887525342153253028) as part of a round of cuts that eliminated her entire desk.

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8cd7892a-e623-460b-a706-ae0b37bb206b_942x770.png)

The fact that something like this could happen to a journalist as prolific as Miranda is an indictment of the media industry. Miranda has exposed egregious wrongdoing by the oil and gas industry. She‚Äôs written about how an Alabama power company [seized control of a local Black newspaper](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/jan/17/alabama-power-electric-utility-finance-birmingham-news). She‚Äôs [exposed utility regulators taking millions](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/11/state-utility-commission-regulators-millions-campaign-money-industries-utilities-fossil-fuel-interests/) from the industries they oversee. She [used satellite analysis to expose a BP-owned company](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/jul/11/finite-carbon-forest-offsets-analysis) for selling carbon credits on trees that aren‚Äôt in danger. Just [take a look at some of her recent reporting here](https://floodlightnews.org/author/miranda/).

She was a finalist for the 2023 Goldsmith Prize for Investigative Reporting. Her investigation into a grassroots seeming anti-solar group that had ties to a conservative political activist won second place in the 2024 National Headliner Awards for investigative collaborations. She is also a multi-media superstar with experience in broadcast media, podcasting, and writing.

Miranda has reported for nearly every major outlet including *The New York Times, The Atlantic, The Guardian, New York Magazine* and more. While she primarily covers climate-related news, she has insane range. In 2023 she revealed that, after possibly the most expensive jewelry heist in U.S. history, [Brink‚Äôs security company went after the victims](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2023/05/the-ugly-fight-over-the-brinks-robbery-in-california.html). She covered the 2021 insurrection, [profiling Ashli Babbitt](https://archive.ph/R9XVL#selection-1319.31-1319.44), a Trump supporter who was shot that day and died. Just this week she was writing about how Trump is [targeting key environmental employees who help prosecute polluters](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-targeting-environmental-employees_n_67a3a697e4b0ef1f60d547ba).

All of this is to say, that if someone like Miranda can get laid off and struggle to find a job in journalism, no one is safe. The mainstream media is riddled with problems, and I strongly believe that a robust independent media ecosystem is preferable to a billionaire-backed corporate media landscape, but we desperately need journalists right now. The American public is less informed when journalists like Miranda can‚Äôt do their crucial reporting, which is essential to hold power to account.

I have no idea if anyone reading this knows anyone (ideally in L.A.) hiring an investigative reporter or someone with her skills, but [here is Miranda‚Äôs LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/miranda-green-9795653b/). If you‚Äôd like to connect with her, even for part time work, just let me know I‚Äôd be happy to pass along her direct info.
