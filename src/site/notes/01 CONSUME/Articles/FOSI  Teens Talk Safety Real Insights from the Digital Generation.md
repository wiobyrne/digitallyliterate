# FOSI | Teens Talk Safety: Real Insights from the Digital Generation

## Key Points:
In an era where digital interactions are a cornerstone of everyday life, fostering online safety is more important than ever. And, with *Safer Internet Day* approaching, it’s the perfect time to highlight the voices of those who experience the online world firsthand—teens. That’s why FOSI and Snapchat partnered on *Teens Talk Safety: Insights from FOSI + Snap*, a project that amplifies teen perspectives and explores best practices for navigating the digital world. Featuring firsthand insights from Snap’s Teen Council for Digital Well-Being and expert guidance from FOSI’s Research and Program Specialist, Alanna Powers, this initiative sheds light on how young people are shaping the conversation around online safety.

#### **What Teens Taught Us About Online Safety**

What made this initiative especially meaningful was the opportunity to engage with teens directly—hearing their real-world experiences, learning from their perspectives, and seeing how they approach online safety in their daily lives. Too often, conversations about digital well-being happen *about* young people rather than *with* them, even though they navigate these spaces every day.

Each episode in the *Teens Talk Safety* series explores a different aspect of online safety, offering a glimpse into how teens think about and manage their digital lives. Their experiences reveal the real challenges they face and the strategies they use to stay safe—whether it’s setting boundaries, dealing with negative interactions, or having honest conversations with parents.

Brielle emphasized that staying safe online starts with small, intentional choices. Keeping accounts private, thinking carefully about what to share, and being mindful of who can see your content are all ways to take control of your digital presence. Her experience reflects how many teens actively manage their online identities, recognizing that safety is as much about awareness as it is about protection.

Jahan shared a common challenge: while reporting and blocking tools exist, many teens hesitate to use them. He found that taking action—whether by removing harmful content, blocking negativity, or reporting inappropriate behavior—helped him create a more positive digital space. His experience highlights the importance of normalizing these tools, so teens feel empowered to use them when necessary.

#### [**Episode 3: How Teens Talk to Their Parents About Online Safety**](https://vimeo.com/1055593499?share=copy)

For Thomas, open and honest conversations with his parent made a huge difference in how he navigates the online world. Rather than relying on strict rules, they built trust through ongoing discussions, making it easier to work through challenges together. His experience reinforces the idea that when parents listen and engage rather than just set restrictions, teens feel more supported and empowered.

Nadine’s perspective on parental controls changed over time. What once felt restrictive became a tool for collaboration when she was included in conversations about online safety. She realized that when teens and parents work together to set boundaries, it fosters trust and makes digital safety a shared effort rather than a one-sided rule.

Alex highlighted how small choices—like limiting notifications, setting personal boundaries, and supporting friends online—can contribute to a healthier digital space. He emphasized that safety isn’t just about avoiding harm; it’s also about actively shaping the kind of online environment you want to be part of. His experience is a reminder that teens aren’t just navigating the internet—they’re helping define what safe and supportive digital spaces look like.

#### **Looking Ahead**

Working with these teens was a reminder that online safety isn’t just about policies and tools—it’s about the real people who navigate online spaces each day. Their experiences turned this project into more than just a video series; it became a reflection of how young people think about, adapt to, and take charge of their online environments.

A huge thank you to Snapchat for their collaboration in bringing this project to life. By working together, we were able to create something that not only informs but also empowers teens and the people who support them.

*“It is critical that we continue to find ways to elevate and incorporate teens' perspectives in ongoing conversations about online safety. We thank FOSI for this opportunity to highlight insights from our teen Council for Digital Well-Being, and hope their guidance resonates with families everywhere.”* - Viraj Doshi, Snap Platform Safety Lead 

As *Safer Internet Day* reminds us each year, building a better online world isn’t about one-time solutions—it’s an ongoing effort that evolves with the people who use it. And if there’s one thing this project made clear, it’s that when we take the time to listen to teens, we all walk away with a better understanding of what a safer and more thoughtful digital future can look like.
