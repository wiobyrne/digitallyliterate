# The Community Canvas

## Key Points:
## Moving Forward & Onward

Since publishing the Canvas in 2017 we have learned so much about community and want to continue supporting community builders. However during that journey we also realized that we felt called to pursue different directions and have launched separate projects going forward. Find out more about where these new projects are headed at [Together Institute](https://www.together-institute.org/community) and [Close Knit.](http://closeknit.co/) 

While this project has come to a close, this website, the framework and the guidebooks below will continue to stay accessible and we hope it will provide joy and meaning to you and your groups.

### **Key questions**

For each of the 17 themes, we have identified a set of questions that will help find the right answers for your own community. We provide worksheets to make the questions actionable.

### **Reflections**

While the Canvas doesn't give answers, we provide further background for each of the 17 themes, based on our observations and feedback from leading community builders. In future versions we're going to include case studies for each theme.
