# We Are Open Cooperative

## Key Points:
## We'll Untangle Your Organisational Spaghetti.

üëã We‚Äôre a not-for-profit worker co-op of strategists, innovators, and facilitators. We design and deliver strategies and tactics to untangle your organisational spaghetti by working hand-in-hand with you and your team, helping everyone learn where to intervene in complex systems.

We‚Äôve partnered with plenty of companies, charities, and non-profits that you (and perhaps more importantly, your boss) have heard of. Here‚Äôs a few of them:

We don‚Äôt just think outside the box; we shred it (and then recycle it, obviously). Our services include consultancy, workshops and training, project and product management, research and development, community building, and everything in between.

We thrive on working with purpose-driven organisations that value environmental sustainability, social responsibility, equality, and human rights. Based in the UK and Germany, we believe in making things better, together.

## Aren't we "the badges people"?

Yes, our members have been involved in Open Badges since the very beginning. We are experts in education, digital credentialing and recognition. We believe that badges aren't just a way to recognise growth and development, they play an important role in the future of identity.
