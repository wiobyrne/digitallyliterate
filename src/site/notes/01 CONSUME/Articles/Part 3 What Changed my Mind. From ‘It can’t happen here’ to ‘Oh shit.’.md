# Part 3: What Changed my Mind. From ‘It can’t happen here’ to ‘Oh shit.’

## Key Points:
So, I’ve gotten some strong engagement with my earlier posts about the possibility of Trump invoking the Insurrection Act, and the dominoes that might fall afterward.

For those just joining, here’s the context. I’m calling this series, **“The Coup Playbook: How They Quietly Kill the Constitution and Democracy in the Coming Weeks and Months.”**

Here are links to the previous posts:

- [**Part 2: *If the Shit Actually Hits the Fan.***](https://medium.com/@aletheisthenes/if-the-shit-actually-hits-the-fan-b491462c6057)

**This is Part 3:****What Changed My Mind. From “It Can’t Happen Here” to “Oh Shit.”**

I am also posting a second, shorter version that might be more readable, called Part 3A TLDR: What Changed My Mind. From “It Can’t Happen Here” to “Oh Shit.”

More notes about why two versions in the footnotes at the bottom.

**Part 4: Beat the Rush: How to Prepare Before the Lights Go Out,** will also be up shortly.

**Part 5: Check my Math, will follow soon after: more about that in a moment.**

## Why I’m Writing

My entire purpose here is simple: **to raise awareness of what I see as a very real possibility of a coup, executed within the bounds of executive authority and legal gray zones, with the Insurrection Act as the opening move.**

**It matches historical patterns.** And it fits too well with the actions we are seeing day-by-day, and more than that, the interests of those in power.

**I’m not an insider.** I have no platform or position beyond this blog, and and am wholly motivated by the conviction that the house is on fire and no one else is yelling.

**Everything I see going on aligns perfectly with the previous playbooks of past coups** that have led to the end of democracy in other countries, in history and even not-so-recent history.

I want to **make people aware of the likely steps of what a coup would look like** that dismantles the US Democracy, and puts Trump and his cabal in place as a permanent, unelected, authoritarian junta.

I am doing this because I see it as highly probable that this is their plan.

I may be crazy.

But as crazy as it all sounds (and I have regularly been asking myself if I’ve boarded the crazy train), everything seems not just plausible, but every step and action of the new Trump administration and their backers appears aligned.

**This is the only way I can think of to stop it if I’m right.**

**I may not be right. I may be wasting your time, and getting people riled up unnecessarily.**

But, if I am right… I could not live with myself if I foresaw this and didn’t do everything I could to head it off.

## Check My Math

I’ll be publishing a separate, detailed breakdown of all the facts I considered that led me to become convinced that a coup may be in progress in another post, which will be up shortly.

It outlines all of the evidence, as well as my assumptions and conclusions.

**You can disagree.**

**Actually, I encourage you to.**

Look at the facts, add your own.

Weigh them.

Interpret them.

**Prove me wrong.** Show me and everyone my logical flaws. Point out the things I’ve missed, or that I claim as true or likely without enough evidence.

**And don’t rely on the opinions of some anonymous internet stranger.**

Look at what pundits, politicians, and the folks in the Trump Administration are saying about each of the items I’ll be calling out, and how they are being reported on Fox News, CNN, OAN, BBC, AFP, everything.

**As we are all sick of hearing, as it’s usually said disingenously, "do your own research." But do a bit more research than reading wacko blog posts or media that doesn’t give you any cognitive dissonance. Including and especially this one.**

At the end of the upcoming post, I’ll give you instructions — as a starting point — on how to take these facts, and plug them into the LLM of your choice... and then both validate the facts, and then assess the probable outcomes yourself.

I've done this.

You should do it, too.

You can challenge it. You should.

Look at the data. Ask questions. then decide for yourself.

If you think I’m wrong, great.

**But if you decide I’m not — we have a short runway.**

## Preparing for the Worst

**There is actually a good chance Hegseth and Noem may come back with a recommendation to NOT invoke the Insurrection Act.**

**They may declare victory at the border,** everything is good. No need for the Insurrection Act. No further steps needed. Move along, nothing to see here. And that will show that maybe everything I've been warning about is exactly what some folks have said it is: hysteria and speculative fiction.

I am hoping fervently folks who have said as much are right.

No one likes to be wrong. But I will be overjoyed to be.

**By all rational measurements, control of the border has been achieved.** Illegal crossings have dropped by an estimated 70%. And while there haven’t been as many deportations as planned, Noem and others can point to notable successes and increased enforcement.

**In which case there's no reason to recommend invoking the Insurrection Act**.

**Unless Trump wants them to.**

**He still might.**

If Trump does invoke the Act, even with a pretext of “border victory,” it eases the way for everything that could follow— martial law, suspended elections, full consolidation of power.

Also, as I said in an earlier post, one of my personal observations is that **Trump is about gaining as much power as possible, having as many options as he can, as many cards to play, and also being able to do whatever the hell he wants.** For that reason, I believe no matter what the recommendation, he and his handlers may decide to invoke the Insurrection Act anyway. It removes barriers. Gives him options, gives him cards.

And Hegseth and Noem will do exactly what Trump wants. If Trump decides he wants the recommendation to invoke, that’s what they will give him.

**He can also make the choice, after the recommendation, to bide his time.** To wait, keep invoking it as a card to play later.

I really don't know the math. This isn't normal politics. We are not in normal times, and Trump is not a normal person.

But I do know this: **What most guides Trump and every decision he makes is whatever serves his personal interests, power, image, or survival in that moment—loyalty to himself above all else.**

Even if his advisors say it’s not necessary, he’ll do what serves him best in that moment. His loyalty is only to himself. And once the machinery of state control starts rolling, it’s not likely to stop.

**And not coincidentally, the propaganda is already in overdrive.** The stage is being set — demonization of protestors, demonization of Canada, of NATO, of Europe, vilification of the “woke left,” normalization of extraordinary powers… suggestions of a third term and no more elections.

**And a single act of significant violence or terror — especially one blamed on the left — could seal the deal. Insurrection Act or not.**

If you look at the classic playbooks for putting a dictatorship in place in the past, **manufactured crises are always a key step along the progression.**

## What Changed My Mind

A month ago, I didn’t think it could happen here.

I said as much to a friend, as I talked him off the ledge. The pendulum swings. Trump will over-reach. I thought the system would hold. It usually does.

I’m going to make a confession. I am a Republican. I have been my entire life, driven largely by a conviction in my formative years that the Soviet Union really *were* the bad guys, and Western Democracy, for all its flaws, was a superior system. I knew we were built on a foundation outlined by key documents like the Declaration of Independence, that said that everyone is entitled to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. On the Constitution, seeking a more perfect union, that all men are created equal. No Kings. For the People, of the People, By the People.

I actually worked for a Republican-affiliated organization in Washington D.C. after college. For a quite a while. Until I needed to make better money to support my family. Also, I never was able to drink the Kool-Aid of Newt Gingrich, Lee Atwater, Robert Ailes, Rush Limbaugh. I liked Bush 1 okay, but the GOP lost me with Bush 2 and the useless Gulf War that was based on what were clearly lies and trumped-up evidence of WMD. I also never got caught up in the culture wars bullshit.

But that’s not saying I’m a fan of the woke left, either. Some of these folks — despite what I’m sure are good intentions — really boarded the crazy train (says the guy who may have boarded the crazy train himself) with some of the social agenda stuff beng pushed on people, and the cancelling and censorship was becoming a real issue, which turned many normies off and cost Harris the election. But whatever. I figured the Democrats would get their shit together when they kept losing elections, maybe run someone who can win next time. But anyway.

But back to talking with my very-liberal but smart-as-hell buddy. **After telling him I thought it would all blow over… it soon became apparent to me that this time, it was different.** The pattern of events and actions, and their speed, didn’t add up. It seemed all just vandalism, destructive, and what the fuck is the deal with embracing Putin? I’ll summarize lots of other stuff in in my next post, but for the moment we will assume most people reading this are aware of what I’m talking about.

**Then something showed up in my feed that the “techno-optimists,”** as they call themselves, had a huge impact on several key members of the Trump administration. And these folks were behind Vance, and I started digging deeper of what was really driving their vision.

**At first it seemed benign.** Technology can save our problems, and the world’s serious problems. I actually agree. But it didn’t stop there. If you read Andreessen’s “ [Techno-Optimist Manifesto](https://a16z.com/the-techno-optimist-manifesto/),” there’s one line that opens the Pandora’s box into what turned into an increasingly surreal and disturbing vision: ***“Technologically weak liberal democracies lose to their autocratic rivals, making everyone worse off.”* Again, at first it seems benign… until you start to see where they take this.** The Future they want is more important than anything, and Democracy isn’t up the challenge. So we’ll have to dispense with it, and civil rights and freedoms, to beat our aggressive rivals. Omeletes, eggs, you know the drill.

I dug in more… It wasn’t long before **I came across other terms for these guys, that they even call themselves: *anarcho-capitalists,* and *Corporate Monarchists.*****These folks believe Democracy is a failure, and what the world needs is CEO-Kings, to make the tough calls, achieve important technological visions for humanity, and get rid of the failing and obstructive US government,** with its pesky labor and environmental laws and the like, and give absolute power to a series of corporate fiefdoms, where we are all serfs.

**The adherents of this philosophy includes a number of billionaires, mostly with libertarian mindsets, vastly rich and powerful,** and including prominently a number of guys (all guys, mostly white guys) including **Elon Musk,** but also including in particular a guy named **Peter Thiel,** who sponsored now Vice-President **JD Vance’s** political career. Then a host of others, both billionaires and alt-right visionaries: A few other notables include **Andreessen, Anton, Bannon,** and their philosopher kings, **Curtis Yarvin** and **Nick Land. The last two have built the extensive philosophy called Corporate Monarchy** that the former people have bought into, that represents all the capitalist-end-game worst-case scenarios that we all see in fucking video games coming to fruition. **Make Trump King. (Or someone else… Trump may not be quite as secure as he thinks.) Get rid of democracy and the Constitution.** Workers are serfs working for CEO Kings… if you’re lucky and can get a job. But you have no rights.

On the surface, it all seems actually batshit insane.

Unbelievable.

Unhinged.

**But the fact is, not only is there a huge written record of these folks and their intellectual leaders Yarvin and Land putting all their plans in writing.**

**Thiel, Vance, Anton and others are on-record as saying Yarvin and Land are among the top people who have influenced how they think.**

Vance is Vice President of the United States.

Anton is Director of Policy Planning at the U.S. State Department.

And while this stretches credulity, **these same folks even attended a very exclusive Inauguration Ball for Trump called "The Coronation."** It was even held at the Watergate. The irony of all this shit. I swear I’m not making any of this up. They might even be trolling us, taunting the world. “You can’t stop us, normies.” I really wonder that. Just like a certain arm motion a certain person gave twice, knowing damn well that he could get away with it.

**Then, there’s the concept of “Accelerationism.” Acceleration! That’s a good thing, right?**

**Uh, no. What they mean and advocate is accelerating the collapse of society, so they can create something new.**

Click.

**Suddenly, all these actions to tear everything down, to destroy everything that works, turn people against each other, embrace dictators perpetuating crimes against humanity, towards over-riding democracy… it all makes sense.**

Want proof?

I would.

So here is an amazing, full, footnoted, extensive documentation of what they believe by someone smarter than me. We are all busy. Take the time to read it anyway: “ [The Philosophy Behind DOGE](https://open.substack.com/pub/keeptrack/p/the-philosophy-behind-doge-curtis?r=b6t5n&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&showWelcomeOnShare=false) ” by KeepTrack on Substack. It connects the dots between Yarvin’s and Land’s ideas and the billionaires backing them. And here’s [the reddit version](https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/s/95k7VjgKa4) he posted with more obvious links to primary sources if you prefer that.

**These aren’t conspiracies. These people write it all down.** They say it out loud. **At some point it’s no longer a conspiracy: it is an active plan. A plan being advocated for and executed by the most successful entrepreneurs in history.**

And now their followers are in top roles in the Trump administration.

**The thing that really convinced me is what kind of people these are**.

These Billionaires and hangers-on are self-made anti-government libertarians. **These are "can-do" people who make and execute on plans.**

It's no longer a "half-assed conspiracy" as Karl Rove once called Republicans trying to execute their goals in the past.

While MAGA is half-assed at best --I'd maybe generously give them a quarter-ass personally-- with these folks involved, **MAGA is being used as a tool by two motivated and competent forces to bring their strategic plans to fruition: the Techno-fascist billionaires, and also Russia.**

These two groups aren't so much working together (probably), as they have a coincidence of interest.

**And that's how most alliances work. Pure self-interest.**

Russia has a vested interest in the United States destroying itself, and pulling from the global stage, allowing Russia to work its will.

The Techno-optimists (called techno-fascists by their detractors) are mostly libertarian billionaires have a philosophy of self-interest, where they want to be able to do whatever the fuck they want in their dystopian seasteads and corporate monarchies. Technology and some vague vision of robot colonies on Mars are more important than human lives and human dignity.

These two groups are willing to work with each other --or at least not oppose each other-- to achieve their common purpose.

**They will undoubtedly turn on each other eventually,** but only after they are standing astride the corpse of what used to be the United States and 80 years of global peace and prosperity.

I still find it jaw-droppingly amazing that I am writing these words.

## I May Be Wrong. But as a Person with a Moral Compass, I Have to Consider the Possibility That I Am Right.

Maybe I’m only partially right, and we skip right over the Insurrection Act and go right to martial law.

Maybe things won’t be as bad as I think. Probably, to be honest, that’s the best bet. I’ll even admit that.

But maybe… maybe it’s worse than we think. We’re Germany in 1933. We’re Chile in 1973. We’re Turkey, Argentina, Brazil, Pakistan, Greece, Iran in any number of years, where the current government was overthrown and a dictatorship put in place.

An American who loves his country and what it (once) stood for, I have a duty to my country, my fellow citizens, and the world to do what I can to try to make people aware so that maybe we can stop it.

## Finally, some good news. Shit like this can't stand the light of day.

Like the Ringwraiths in the Lord of the Rings, the Nazgûl, the people behind this might not be totally destroyed by sunlight, but they are weakened. And that might be enough to give those of us who resist them enough time to mount a defense.

Again, I’ve had quite a few folks have said I’m delusional, living in a fantasy world. I’m still rooting for those folks to be right.

I’d much rather be crazy than any of this being even partially true.

But there’s too much evidence to not consider as a serious possibility.

This isn’t just MAGA nonsense anymore. That’s the sideshow.

## Okay, So What Now?

This post got much longer than I meant for it to.

So I will be breaking this into another post that will be up shortly.

**Look for Part 4: Beat the Rush: How to Prepare Before the Lights Go Out, which will be up shortly.**

This one will go into details on how to prepare in advance for what could potentially be in store… and starts with some chilling thoughts about just how fragile our entire modern socieity is, totally dependent upon power grids and the Internet. What happens when someone turns them off? We all saw how crazy things got fast with supply chains during COVID.

If the government chooses to use turning off the power as an instrument to get control of areas that are resisting… you ain’t seen nuthin’ yet.

**And remember: *You are not alone. Prepare. Share the word. Educate others. Stay human. Stay free.***

## Footnotes

My method to get my stuff out has been to write wordy, long posts with all my thoughts and notes, and then have ChatGPT edit it down to something shorter and more readable for a general, busy audience.

Some folks have criticized this, and were pretty adamant that I have ChatGPT writing the whole thing.

That is not the case. I don’t really care what people think about my process: my goal is just to get the word out, as fast and impactfuly as possible.

But, given the criticism, I am doing two versions of this post.

The second version is the TLDR version for busy folks, slimmed down by ChatGPT. You might prefer that version. You’ll get through it quicker, that’s for sure.

But in this version, I want you to see what the original version looked like, and also the many asides and details that get cut out of more tightly edited writing.

I personally prefer the longer version. I love to read, don’t mind wading through long text with detailed thoughts and side-thoughts. But yeah, most people don’t.

I’m grateful to ChatGPT: what I put out with it is better, tighter, and most importantly, faster.

**And we don’t have much time.**

My next post provides a useful — if somewhat scary — guide for prepping for what might be coming with limited money and time.
