On this episode of the *Speaking of … College of Charleston* podcast, we speak to [**Ian O’Byrne**](https://charleston.edu/school-education/faculty/obyrne-ian.php), associate professor of literacy education in the [School of Education](https://charleston.edu/school-education/), about AI in higher education.

O’Byrne’s work centers on teaching, learning and technology, and he is incredibly prolific, publishing newsletters, blog posts and videos on digital literacy. Innovative in the classroom, he is always seeking new ways to keep students engaged.

In this podcast, O’Byrne discusses how higher education can integrate AI to support learning while maintaining academic integrity. He addresses concerns about cheating and fostering creativity and critical thinking. He also highlights the need for authentic assessment and broader ethical considerations, advocating for more inclusive discussions involving students, faculty and alumni.

Most importantly, he encourages educators to have more dialogue about what these things mean for the classroom.

“We need to have long-term meaningful discussions with faculty and staff about what we mean when we talk about academic rigor,” he says. “What do we mean when we talk about authentic assessment? What do these things mean for our classroom? What do they mean for our disciplines? In what ways can AI be harnessed to support rather than hinder students’ learning experiences, and how can educators use AI to foster creativity, critical thinking and ethical collaboration?

“I would urge us to have those discussions, not just as colleagues, but with our students,” he adds. “Our students are the best part about our institution. They’re the best part about our programs, and they are key contributors.”
