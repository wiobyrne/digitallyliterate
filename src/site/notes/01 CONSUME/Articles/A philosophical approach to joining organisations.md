# A philosophical approach to joining organisations

## Key Points:
Consultants like me are sometimes engaged by clients on a very short-term basis, and sometimes embedded inside organisations for much longer periods of time. Yesterday, I started a period of ’embedding’, this time with [Moodle](https://moodle.org/).

While I’ll discuss elsewhere the things I’ll be working on over the coming weeks and months, in this post I want to consider what it’s like to start working with a new organisation from a *philosophical* perspective.

---

The areas of enquiry represented by what we call ‘Philosophy’ can be sub-divided in many ways and, of course, people differ as to how this should be done. When I think about Philosophy, over and above the (valuable) ‘history of ideas’ courses taught to undergraduates, I tend to use the following buckets:

- **Epistemology –** *what can we know?*
- **Ethics** – *how should we act/behave?*
- **Ontology** – *what exists in the world?*
- **Metaphysics** – *what else exists?*

I’m sure some people reading this may disagree with these simple definitions, and with separating out metaphysics and ontology, but hopefully you’ll see why I tend to do this in a moment.

When a person joins a new organisation, there’s often a mad rush to get them ‘up-to-speed’ as quickly as possible. Not *one minute* should be wasted to ensure that they can reach full operating efficiency as soon as possible. Taken to its logical conclusion, I’m sure there are plenty of organisations that would like to be be able to send the required knowledge directly into a new employee’s brain, [*Matrix*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix)\-style.

I was ‘onboarded’ by Moodle HR yesterday and, while they can improve the experience, it was the first time an organisation has actually set out its information landscape. It sounds like such a simple thing, but this **ontology** of the organisation as it sees itself, is a hugely valuable thing to share. After all, the inverse of this — finding out about things in a piecemeal way — can be rather anxiety-inducing.

In the past, I’ve joined organisations that explicitly *don’t* share things like org charts and what technologies they use. The reason given for this is often that such documents would be ‘out of date as soon as they’re created’, but in reality it’s usually because there’s a huge disconnect between different parts of the organisation. There *is* no map or shared reality.

**Ontology** is an easy one for organisations to focus upon. They can point to things and draw employees’ attention to them, even if it’s just directing people to a URL or a particular app. What’s harder is getting to the other three: the **epistemology**, **ethics**, and **metaphysics** of an organisation.

In an organisational context, the question of **ethics** isn’t solved simply by having a mission or a values statement. It has to be lived and demonstrated. There are large, organisation-wide ethical issues that can only really be solved by the leadership team. Examples of these might include the type of investment that the organisation takes, diversity issues in hiring, or the way it interacts with the natural environment.

As well as these large, organisation-wide issues, there are also much smaller, everyday ethical issues. In fact, some of these might not even be put under a banner of ‘ethics’ by most people. For example, I’d include in this list of smaller ethical issues things like the amount to which line managers and senior management ‘check up’ on employees.

> “If you don’t have your own time, then you have no control of your day. And if you have no control of your day then you end up working longer than you should.” ([Jason Fried](http://hurryslowly.co/001-jason-fried/))

These also include the way in which members of the organisation interact with one another. A lot of this would perhaps traditionally go under ‘culture’ or perhaps ‘etiquette’ but, actually, I think considering this as part of the wider **ethics** of an organisation is a better way to think about it.

It obviously takes time to figure out the lived reality of **ethics** within an organisation. The same is even more true of its **epistemology** and **metaphysics**. We’re going a stage deeper here.

You can see the **ontology** of an organisation; you can point to different things that exist. To a great extent you can see the outputs of the **ethics** of an organisation; you can point to the outputs it creates. When it comes to **epistemology** and **metaphysics**, however, we’re in a less tangible realm: *what can we know? what else exists?*

It takes a while to understand the **epistemology** of an organisation. A new employee (or contractor) isn’t going to be able to figure out an organisation’s approach to the above questions in the first few days, or even weeks, after joining. Again, a lot of these issues are lumped within the rather unhelpful category of ‘culture’.

Epistemological questions are particularly interesting for organisations that deal primarily in bits and bytes and digital ‘stuff’ that can affect people’s lives in a material way. The frontiers offline are *physical*, whereas the frontiers online are *conceptual*.

Consequently, when organisations ask ‘what can we know?’ it’s a collection of individuals with hopes, dreams, and inbuilt-biases making value judgements. More than that, it’s a collection of people responding to a particular set of pressures affecting them individually and corporately, and coming to collective epistemological decisions.

I’d include examples such as [Facebook’s algorithmic approach](https://www.constellationr.com/blog-news/myth-informed-internet-user) to matching ‘people you may know’ here, as well as edtech companies [gathering brainwave data](https://www.edsurge.com/news/2017-10-26-this-company-wants-to-gather-student-brainwave-data-to-measure-engagement) to measure ‘student engagement’. As the Contrafabulists show with their [work around predictions](http://predictions.contrafabulists.com/), when you say that the world is, or will be, a certain way, you’re revealing your **epistemology**.

---

**Metaphysics** is a harder thing to pin down, and perhaps the most difficult thing for an organisation to access directly. Some schools of philosophy, in fact, believe that metaphysics is meaningless and not worth studying. I disagree.

If we conceptualise **metaphysics** as asking the question *what else exists?* then we can see that this is the kind of question that can drive organisations forward and help them to improve. This is particularly important for organisations who create digital products and services, as they can literally *invent* these from ones and zeroes.

Martin Dougiamas, CEO of Moodle, shared with me a book called [*Reinventing Organizations*](http://www.reinventingorganizations.com/) that’s inspired him recently. Although I’m yet to read it, even the book’s website gives an example of the kind of thing I mean when talking about organisational metaphysics. There’s a ‘pay-what-feels-right’ option for the book, instead of a single price. If we step back and think about it for a moment, this is an acknowledgement that the full value of something like a book can’t be captured in a financial transaction. It also makes us question what a ‘book’ actually is when it’s digital and the distribution value drops close to zero.

I haven’t finished thinking about this philosophical approach to joining organisations. No doubt, any comments I receive below and on various networks of which I’m part will help inform my thinking. As, of course, will my experiences as I spend more time with Moodle.

The important thing for me is to realise that when you’re joining an organisation, what you’re doing is plugging yourself (a complex mixture of thoughts, emotions, and biases) into something that isn’t necessarily an easy thing to understand. To hurry and try and ‘get-up-to-speed’ quickly, therefore, might actually waste more time than it saves.
