# Elon Musk’s A.I.-Fuelled War on Human Agency

## Key Points:
Musk seeks not only to dismantle the federal government but to install his own technological vision of the future at its heart—techno-fascism by chatbot.

Not long ago, the American public could have been forgiven for thinking of Elon Musk’s vaunted Department of Government Efficiency (*DOGE*) as a version of a familiar Republican cost-cutting, government-shrinking project. The man who took over Twitter, now X, and slashed its staff by around eighty per cent would take a similarly aggressive tack against bureaucratic inefficiency, reining in budgets and laying off federal employees. In the past couple of weeks, though, it’s become clear that Musk’s aim within the Trump Administration goes further: he wants not only to reduce the U.S. government but to install his own technological vision of the future at its heart.
