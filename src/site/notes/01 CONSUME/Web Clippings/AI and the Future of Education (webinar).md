An Educator's Repository of Ethical Statements to Opt Out (and other spells)

I had the pleasure of live cartooning a webinar on [AI and the future of education](https://lu.ma/asd482c8?tk=WuBEnP). facilitated by Doug Belshaw and Laura Hilliger of [WeAreOpen Coop](https://weareopen.coop/). They were joined by fellow thinkers Helen Beetham, Bryan Alexander, Ian Oâ€™Byrne and Karen Louise Smith.

The conversation was harvested in real time, using the hybrid approach of capturing ideas on paper during the webinar, and then developing them further afterwards on an iPad.

Some ideas came from the panelists directly, whilst others originated from the chat.
