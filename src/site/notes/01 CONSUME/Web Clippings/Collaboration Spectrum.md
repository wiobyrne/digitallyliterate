# Collaboration Spectrum

[Simon Fraser University](https://www.downes.ca/feed/7657), May 26, 2025  

I was led here by the Collaboration Spectrum image, which I though was a decent representation of a scale of degrees of integration in cases where people work together. See my [Collaboration vs Cooperation](https://www.downes.ca/post/presentation/340) presentation. The page has a number of openly licensed images you can use for your your project or presentation. The website as a whole is devoted to helping you "find ways to consider the differences between simple, complicated, complex and chaotic."
