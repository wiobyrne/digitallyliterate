In more than thirty years as a writer, editor, and publisher, I have, to my best reckoning, introduced, abridged, issued or reissued, and read nearly every major work of inspirational literature produced or translated into English.

Based on experience, the “rules” of effective living—at least those I consider befitting an ethical and accountable person—are reducible to these:

1) Do your work—do it on time and fully, if not early and overabundantly.

2) Deal plainly.

3) Acknowledge failure.

4) There exists uncanny congruity between thought and experience.

5) Pay people on time.

6) Be willing to clean toilets and wash floors.

7) Do not over-talk.

8) Speak only of what you know well.

9) Apologize.

10) Judge quality not category.

11) Research every important question independently.

12) Expect corruption.

13) “Beware the devastation of conflict; war must never be pursued lightly.” (Sun Tzu)

14) The loftier the language, the lower the behavior.

15) Take due credit. You will get blame when you do not deserve it.

16) Do not complain.

17) Thank people sincerely.

18) Argue with a fool, make a fool your colleague.

19) Measure twice.

20) Get away from cruel people—at all costs.

21) People lie.

22) Great execution matters far more than great ideas.

23) Never humor or accommodate bullies.

25) People see only those traits they possess.

26) Focus on one area of expertise and know it comprehensively.

27) Relationships define your life and happiness.

28) Never underestimate money or sex.

29) Far better to find your group than to win people over.

30) “The art of war is the art of deception.” (Sun Tzu)

31) In terms of investments, virtually nothing, over time, outpaces an index fund.

32) Brilliant people are wrong all the time.

33) When you feel a sense of unease, honor it without question.

34) The only real emergency is a medical emergency.

35) Give no second chances to anyone who shows disrespect.

36) “In the long run, we find what we expect. We shall be fortunate then if we expect great things.” (Thoreau)

37) Honor every religion.

38) Look people in the eye, recognize them, acknowledge them.

39) Tip well.

40) Eschew rhetorical questions.

41) Use sarcasm rarely.

42) Do not be an asshole.

43) Learn to fight.

44) Reduce food intake by twenty percent.

48) If you see someone mistreat another, he will mistreat you.

49) No one cares about your political opinions; they care only whether you agree with theirs.

50) Anger solves nothing.

51) “Who is evil? He who borrows and does not repay.” (*Ethics of the Fathers, Talmud*)

66) Nothing does more to squander goodwill than being a smartass.

69) Know your preferences, even if you cannot act on them.

70) “The way bread smells depends on how hungry a man is.” (Arab proverb)

71) Morality judges another; ethics judges self.

72) A positive mental attitude means evaluating circumstances based on their capacity for self-development.

73) “A chief feature of false life is that it cannot stand alone, but frantically demands allies to support its false positions.” (Vernon Howard)

74) War or natural disaster abrogates nearly all of these rules; in such case health and survival are the laws.

76) Know who you are talking to.

77) Do your absolute best to carry your own load before bothering another.

78) “Opposition is true Friendship” (Blake)—but only if it is worthy opposition.

83) Boredom invites trouble.

84) It is better and nobler to give away than lend money.

85) Never give up hope that your tormenter will disappear or die. It happens constantly.

86) Extra-physicality or spirituality is as real as the words you are now reading.

100) Those who bill by the hour work not for you but for the hour.

101) “The power of instruction is seldom of much efficacy, except in those happy dispositions where it is almost superfluous.” (Edward Gibbon)

P.S. Do not grow fascinated with people who dislike you. It is a universal of human nature that we project our insecurities onto what we cannot have, including relationships and approval, hence elevating their perceived value.
