As technology evolves and becomes further embedded into everyday life, understanding how families navigate online safety is more important than ever. The Family Online Safety Institute (FOSI), in partnership with Ipsos, conducted the 2025 Online Safety Survey to explore how children and parents experience the internet: what concerns them, what works well, and where challenges remain.

Conducted in the United States between February and March 2025, this nationally representative study surveyed 1,000 children aged 10 to 17 and 1,000 of their parents. The research shines a light on digital behaviors, device usage, parental involvement, and attitudes around risks ranging from social media to generative AI.

The findings offer a complex yet encouraging picture: although about only half of parents use formal parental controls, most are engaged in their children’s digital lives through household rules and open communication. In fact, nearly nine in ten children report feeling comfortable talking to their parents when something online makes them feel unsafe.

The report also highlights generational differences, reveals growing parental awareness of AI use, and identifies significant opportunities for industry and policymakers to improve online safety systems.

This research is part of FOSI’s ongoing biannual effort to track trends in online safety and provides actionable insights for families, technology companies, educators, and lawmakers.
