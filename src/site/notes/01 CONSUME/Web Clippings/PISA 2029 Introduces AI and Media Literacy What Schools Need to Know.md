### The OECD’s latest assessment shift puts critical thinking, algorithmic awareness and media evaluation at the heart of global education.

The OECD has confirmed that the 2029 cycle will include a new focus on AI and media literacy, with the final assessment framework currently in development. It’s a timely and important move and one that every educator should be paying attention to.

In a world where misinformation is widespread, images are easily manipulated, and algorithms quietly shape what we see and believe, the ability to think critically has never mattered more. This new domain of the PISA assessment goes far beyond whether students can use digital tools. It asks a much deeper question:

***Can they recognise when they are being influenced by them?***

### What is Media and AI Literacy?

According to the OECD’s new framework, students will be assessed on their ability to:

- **Identify bias in news, media and AI systems -** They’ll need to understand when a message is trying to persuade, manipulate or deceive and know how to spot it, even when it’s subtle or automated.
- **Understand how algorithms personalise content -** From YouTube recommendations to tailored news feeds, students will need to recognise that what they see online is not neutral, it’s curated by machines, often reinforcing what they already think or feel.
- **Recognise manipulated or synthetic media -** With the rise of deepfakes and generative AI, students must learn to question whether what they’re seeing or hearing is real, and consider how easily digital content can be altered or faked.
- **Reflect on ethical and social implications of technology -** This includes thinking about fairness, privacy, representation and the long-term consequences of AI-driven decisions, who benefits, who’s excluded, and what values are embedded in these tools.
- **Evaluate the reliability and intent behind digital content -** Students will be expected to judge source credibility, detect misleading content, and assess whether something is designed to inform, entertain, provoke or manipulate.

The framework is organised around three core domains:

1. **Access and Comprehension** – understanding and interpreting media messages and AI-generated content
2. **Evaluation and Reflection** – questioning source credibility, uncovering bias, and recognising manipulation
3. **Creation and Engagement** – ethically participating in digital spaces and shaping discourse responsibly

This is not just about screen time or coding skills. It’s about preparing young people to **question the systems** that shape their digital experience and ultimately, their world view.

### Why This Matters

This new assessment focus sends a clear message: AI and media literacy are no longer optional extras. They are **essential components of modern education**. Yet most curricula around the world still don’t explicitly teach students how to evaluate the influence of algorithms or the risks of synthetic media.

Without this understanding, students risk being passive consumers of content, rather than informed citizens who can challenge bias, recognise manipulation, and ask difficult questions.

For schools in the UAE, (where I am based) this direction is well aligned with the nation’s AI Strategy 2031, the **Centennial 2071 Vision**, and ongoing initiatives by the Ministry of Education to embed AI thinking and digital ethics across subjects. The inclusion of AI and media literacy in PISA will further support national strategies aimed at preparing students for an innovation-led economy and global citizenship.

### What Schools Can Do Now

If we want students to succeed in this new domain of assessment, and in life, we need to act now. Here are a few ways to start:

1. **Map your curriculum -** Start with a simple audit. Where do topics like digital bias, media critique, and ethical AI use currently appear? You might find these already sit within ICT, English, PSHE or even Art. Engage subject leaders in identifying existing touchpoints and use curriculum review meetings to plan where these concepts could be introduced or expanded. This is an ideal opportunity to align what you already do with a globally recognised framework.
2. **Use examples that matter -** Bring lessons to life with case studies students can relate to. Show how facial recognition systems have been shown to perform less accurately on darker skin tones. Explore how TikTok’s algorithm creates echo chambers by reinforcing existing beliefs. Discuss a recent viral deepfake and ask students what made it convincing, or misleading. These are not abstract concepts; they are real, lived experiences for today’s learners.
3. **Focus on great questions, not just great answers -** Give students question frameworks they can use again and again. Encourage them to ask: *Who made this? What is the purpose? What voices are missing? Who benefits from this message?* Good questioning habits create critical consumers who don’t just absorb information but interrogate it, exactly what PISA 2029 will measure.
4. **Think across subjects -** This is not the job of one department. AI and media literacy belong across the curriculum. In English, students can analyse persuasive bias and evaluate tone. In Humanities, they can explore the impact of digital media on democracy and activism. In Science, the ethics of data use. In ICT, how algorithms work and why they’re not neutral. These connections make learning richer and more meaningful.
5. **Build staff confidence and awareness -** Not every teacher needs to be a tech expert, but all staff can benefit from understanding the basics of how AI shapes content and how media influences perception. Offer short CPD sessions using real-world examples, and create space for teams to discuss how these issues connect to their subjects. Start small and grow confidence over time.

### The Bigger Picture

By embedding these skills early, we’re not just preparing students for a test in 2029. We’re preparing them for life. The world they’re growing up in demands more than just digital fluency, it demands **ethical, reflective, and critical thinking** at every turn.

If we get this right, media and AI literacy won’t be another curriculum add-on. It will become part of the fabric of how students read, write, evaluate and contribute to the world around them.

**Reflective Question**

Are we giving students the tools to challenge what they see online, or just the skills to scroll through it faster?
