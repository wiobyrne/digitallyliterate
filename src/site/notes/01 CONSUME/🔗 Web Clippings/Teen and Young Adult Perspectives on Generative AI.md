## A National Study Examining Patterns of Use, Excitement, and Concerns

### Findings reveal a nuanced understanding of how different demographic groups perceive and interact with generative AI technologies

Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is an integral part of the digital landscape, creating new opportunities for people to learn, create, and innovate. At the same time, it poses risks to everything from privacy to equity to accuracy. Young people serve as early adopters and influencers of this technology and also will be the first to grapple with its implications.

The nuanced views of teens and young adults from diverse demographic groups are extremely important in considering the future of generative AI and the programs, policies, and design features this new technology brings. In this report from Hopelab, [Common Sense Media](https://www.commonsensemedia.org/), and  [The Center for Digital Thriving at Harvard Graduate School of Education](https://digitalthriving.gse.harvard.edu/), young people offer valuable insights into the potential benefits of generative AI, such as broader access to information, enhanced creativity, and more expansive ecosystem. However, some young people also expressed concerns about potential negative impacts, including job loss, AI taking over the world, intellectual property theft, misinformation and disinformation, and privacy issues.

Young people were directly involved in the creation of survey topics and questions and the interpretation of results. Findings in this report primarily come from [a larger national survey of digital technology and youth](https://hopelab.org/2024-national-survey/) mental health.

#### As generative AI continues to evolve, it is essential that the voices and experiences of young people are included in developing these tools and how they will transform many aspects of our society.

## Report key findings

### Key Finding 1

### Key Finding 2

The most commonly reported uses of generative AI are for getting information (53%) and brainstorming (51%). Among those who used generative AI, Black and Latinx young people are significantly more likely to use it for most activities.

### Key Finding 3

### Key Finding 4

Forty-one percent of young people believe that generative AI is likely to have both positive and negative impacts on their lives in the next ten years. LGBTQ+ young people are more likely to say the impact of generative AI will be mostly negative and less likely to say it will be positive compared to cisgender/straight young people.

### Key Finding 5

Those who expect mostly positive personal impacts from the future of generative AI describe how broader access to information will help with school, work, and their wider community, enhance creativity, and foster opportunities for human advancement.

### Key Finding 6

Young people anticipating mostly negative personal impacts highlight concerns about the future of generative AI related to the loss of jobs, AI taking over the world, intellectual property theft, misinformation/disinformation, and privacy.

### Key Finding 7

Young people want adults to know that “the world is changing,” we are the future,” and “AI is the future.” Some are concerned, saying, “AI is very creepy,” and “AI concerns me,” while others are optimistic, sharing sentiments like, “I really cannot wait to see how it evolves in the future.”



### Key Finding 8

When it comes to concerns about generative AI, the top worries are job loss (46%), AI taking over the world (44%), and intellectual property theft (40%). LGBTQ+ young people are significantly more likely to worry about AI taking over the world compared to cisgender/straight young people.

### Key Finding 9

Young people express a desire for greater transparency, control, and accountability with generative AI technologies. They want to ensure that their personal data is protected, that biases are addressed, and that there is more education around these technologies.

### Key Finding 10

Overall, young people see generative AI as a tool with great potential but also recognize the need for safeguards and ethical considerations in its development and use. They value its ability to enhance creativity and innovation but want to ensure that it is used responsibly and ethically.

## Conclusion

Generative AI holds immense promise for transforming various aspects of society, from education to healthcare to entertainment. However, as this technology continues to evolve rapidly, it is crucial to consider the perspectives of teens and young adults who will be both the creators and consumers of these tools.

This report highlights the diverse views of young people regarding generative AI, showcasing both excitement about its potential benefits and concerns about its risks. By incorporating their voices into the development of generative AI technologies, we can ensure that they are designed with inclusivity, safety, and ethics in mind.

Moving forward, it will be essential for stakeholders in technology, policy-making, education, and beyond to continue engaging with young people on issues related to generative AI. By listening to their insights and addressing their concerns, we can create a future where artificial intelligence enhances human capabilities while upholding core values of equity and well-being.
