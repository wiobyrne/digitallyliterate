# Community Accountability, Restorative Justice, and Transformative Justice
## Highlights



### List suggested tags

---
This page *(which you can share with the shortlink: [http://bit.ly/accountabilityjustice](http://bit.ly/accountabilityjustice))* focuses on discussing forms of addressing harm that ask us to move beyond (and away) from state responses to violence. Instead the frameworks below offer approaches that—among other things—center survivor needs, reject a politic of disposability, encourage community collaboration and reintegration versus isolation, focus on harms versus “broken rules,” aim to transform the conditions that caused the harm in the first place, and honor the humanity of all involved (rather than just the survivors’).

**Below I’ve included the following sections:**

- Introductory Definitions
- Framework Primers
- Personal Advice

- Organizations Doing Relevant Work
- People You Should Know

## Introductory Definitions:

**Restorative Justice (RJ)** is a community-based approach to dealing with harm that centers the dignity of all involved parties, the importance of healing and dialogue, and relies on non-punitive solutions. Of the three frames and practices described here, RJ is the one more widely known and whose approaches are integrated into places like schools and sometimes offered as alternatives to the legal system. Though transformed in many ways, most RJ practices are rooted in or adapted from a constellation of indigenous practices in the U.S, Canada, and New Zealand. Amidst all this, [there has been rampant cultural appropriation and misuse](https://lovingfuture.org/circles-and-cultural-appropriation), especially in [DV/SA advocacy circles](https://www.gatheringpower.org/this-is-a-statement).

**Key questions an RJ approach centers:**

- Who has been harmed? (rather than the “Who is the victim?” question under a legal frame)
- What are their needs? If you don’t know their needs directly, what do you think/gather/assume they might be and what’s informing these thoughts?
- Whose obligations are these?
- Who has a stake in this situation?
- What are the causes? How did the community and larger social factors allow/encourage this to happen?

**Transformative Justice (TJ)** is a political framework and approach for responding to violence, harm and abuse. At its most basic, it seeks to respond to violence without creating more violence and/or engaging in harm reduction to lessen the violence. TJ can be thought of as a way of “making things right,” getting in “right relation,” or creating justice together. Transformative justice responses and interventions 1) do not rely on the state (e.g. police, prisons, the criminal legal system, I.C.E., foster care system (though some TJ responses do rely on or incorporate social services like counseling); 2) do not reinforce or perpetuate violence such as oppressive norms or vigilantism; and most importantly, 3) actively cultivate the things we know prevent violence such as healing, accountability, resilience, and safety for all involved. *(*[*source*](https://transformharm.org/transformative-justice-a-brief-description/) *– Mia Mingus, author)*

**Key questions a TJ approach centers:**

- How are we working toward and/or affirming the safety, healing, and agency of the survivor(s)?
- How are we working toward and/or affirming the accountability and transformation for those who abuse?  
	How are we working toward and/or affirming a community response and community accountability? (both in the sense of accountability TO community and FROM community, response TO community and FROM community)
- How are we working toward and/or affirming a transformation of the social conditions that created and perpetuated these instances of harm?

**Community accountability (CA)** is a community-based strategy, rather than a police/prison-based strategy, to address violence within our communities. Community accountability is a process in which a community – a group of friends, a family, a church, a workplace, an apartment complex, a neighborhood, etc – work together. *(source:* [*INCITE!*](https://incite-national.org/community-accountability/)*)* So, for some people, this can be an umbrella term that can encompass aspects of RJ and TJ, but can also be separate and distinct.

**Key actions of CA (according to INCITE!):**

- Create and affirm values & practices that resist abuse and oppression and encourage safety, support, and accountability
- Develop sustainable strategies to address community members’ abusive behavior, creating a process for them to account for their actions and transform their behavior
- Commit to ongoing development of all members of the community, and the community itself, to transform the political conditions that reinforce oppression and violence
- Provide safety & support to community members who are violently targeted that respects their self-determination

## Personal Advice:

- Always acknowledge, thank, cite, and support your elders and teachers in this work, both those who taught you directly and indirectly.
- If you’re getting or recommending a consultant or circle-keeper, [here are some questions to ask them.](https://livingjusticepress.org/questions-to-consider/)
- Deeply consider the [impact of white supremacy](https://jjie.org/2019/04/10/restorative-practices-require-power-must-be-redistributed-to-black-brown-children/) in your understanding and systems. So many of these frameworks have been developed by Black and Indigenous people, that if you’re not of those communities and NOT integrating reparations, acknowledgement, and material support for BIPOC communities…you should fix that ASAP.
- Take time to [build your skills](https://transformharm.org/building-community-safety-practical-steps-toward-liberatory-transformation/) before attempting any community justice processes, especially if they are large, public, and complex.
- Get buddies to explore this with you. Community accountability requires, you guessed it, community! And this needs to happen at a micro level, not just a micro level. Start integrating these principles.
- Know that this WILL BE MESSY AND ONGOING WORK. You will mess it up, and you will mess it up again. This isn’t an excuse to give up or stop making amends. Get good at apologies, repair, and owning your shit.
- Write out your core values and use them as filters for your work. Check in regularly to see if and how you’re holding true to them.
- Learn how to better regulate your own nervous system and [come down from feeling dissociated, agitated, or frozen](https://aidamanduley.com/resources/mental-health-resources/).
- Stop looking for “the point by point list of what to do” because there isn’t one. The simultaneous beauty and challenge of this work is that it needs to be tailored to the communities in which it’s being practiced. However, don’t reinvent the wheel—many of us have been doing this for years and there’s ample documentation to get you started off on the right foot.
- Remember that doing this work means unlearning a TON of things you’ve been taught, probably your whole life. This is a process more than a destination. It will likely involve shock, pain, confusion, and relapse. That’s normal. Stick with it anyway.
- Pace yourself—don’t try to rush through things. “Move at the speed of trust,” as adrienne maree brown says.

## My Interviews/Recordings:

Below are some interviews where I’ve discussed RJ/TJ/CA, but be aware I post a lot about these issues on social media platforms like Twitter and Instagram (on main [and my story](https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/18143918035002080/)) too. You can [follow along with the hashtag](https://twitter.com/hashtag/pgconfsafeword?src=hashtag_click) when people live-tweeted a session I co-presented at the last Playground Conference in Toronto, or my [panel back in 2016](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23sfsabuse&src=typed_query) at the Woodhull Sexual Freedom Summit, for example!

**07/02/2020** — **[Breaking the cycle of harm](https://briarpatchmagazine.com/articles/view/breaking-the-cycle-of-harm)** by Talia Gruber, a really gorgeous article weaving history, interviews with various practitioners (myself included), personal narrative, and actionable advice.

**04/2020** — the [**Explore More Summit**,](https://aida.krtra.com/t/Eficokb5QqrK) where I did a session covering topics such as ambition, the relationships between sex and capitalism, accountability, justice as an ongoing process that’s both internal and external, and dreams of a future we could build.

**03/14/20** — [**I Reported My Rapist to His Bosses. Now They Want Me to Meet With Him.**](https://slate.com/human-interest/2020/03/restorative-justice-rape-advice.html)by Stoya for Slate. The full text of what I sent and some considerations I suggested below, since the redacted version misses some key points:

> *First of all, a restorative justice process can’t happen without the survivor. So I’m curious what kind of process this group is even doing with the harming party if the person who wrote in isn’t involved…? Are they doing an RJ process with this guy for other harms to other people…? This could be a semantic error, because community accountability work can indeed happen without a survivor, and there are parts of transformative justice that can be done without a survivor, but I’m immediately concerned about this.*
> 
> *It’s also unclear where these people live and if they’re in the same communities still? Or if they’re more geographically separated? Statistically, when serial abuse includes strangling, there is a higher level of danger and lethality so this is a delicate situation and it’s critical to center the safety of the person writing in.*
> 
> ***My suggestions to the person writing in:***
> 
> *Center your safety and mental wellbeing. Ensure you have supports in case your traumas get reactivated. If you choose to participate in a process, tell key people in your life such as your therapist and best friends so that they can check in with you and pay attention to if there are any negative changes in your life, behavior, and such. If you don’t want to participate in a process, that’s okay. If you don’t feel safe engaging with this person, that’s understandable. You shouldn’t have to work to heal this person; that’s not your job. But if you do feel you have a sense of duty to the community and to other people who may be harmed in the future, there is likely a way to do that.*
> 
> *Consider how much of your story you are interested in sharing, with whom, and to what ends. What do you want the outcome to be? How realistic is that? What are the possible unintended consequences of sharing in certain ways or in certain spaces? Are there ways to mitigate any negative impacts or unintended outcomes? Are there concerns that this guy may retaliate, and if so, how? Does he still have access to the explicit video he took of you or was that destroyed? Write down your story if possible so you don’t have to repeat it verbally each time unless you want to do so. If you choose to share, consider asking a friend (or friends!) to help you share information or act as a contact so you don’t have to do it alone.*
> 
> *Filing a report with the police doesn’t have to be incompatible with being involved in some form of community accountability. While the idea behind those non-carceral approaches is that we take power into our own hands rather than give that power to the state, sadly, we still live in a world that is primarily carceral, and where those things can be important in the case of people who serially harm to this degree and intensity. Consider what the goal is with filing.*
> 
> *Learn a bit more about what restorative justice is, and what other things may be available (such as transformative justice, or community accountability work overall). [Here’s a Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/neuronbomb/status/1112049027682426880) where I share some valuable resources. See how this relates to your life, how it aligns with your needs and values.*
> 
> *Ask (or have a proxy do so) who the people are who would be conducting the RJ process, what their experience with RJ is (e.g. when have they done this before, what trainings have they had, etc.), if they have references, what they see as the goals of a process, what the values underlying the process are/might be, and what they see as your role or importance/value in it. More directly, you can raise your concerns about this person’s use of social justice language as a smokescreen, and ask how they plan to address or be vigilant about that. You can ask them that even if they have done RJ work before, if they’ve done it around issues of sexual harm and abuse or manipulation before. You can ask what their trauma training is, or what experience they have in dealing with issues of domestic violence. Doing RJ work for a burglary is different than for issues like this. Don’t just evaluate these answers yourself—get someone else to help you take a look at these. If you’re not already knowledgeable about RJ or some of these other things, it can be hard to evaluate someone’s answers and qualifications. Consider reaching out to a more well-known practitioner for a consult or simply google the names you’re given to see if they pop up anywhere. If their answers seem messy, insufficient, etc, be careful. Don’t engage unless you feel like you’re able to access support and safety because this sort of thing even when well done can reactivate old wounds. When messily done, it can be straight-up retraumatizing and even life-endangering.*
> 
> *Beyond this, has the guy been notified about an RJ process or intentions for that? How does the organization plan to safeguard your privacy and safety? What are their values in the process?*
