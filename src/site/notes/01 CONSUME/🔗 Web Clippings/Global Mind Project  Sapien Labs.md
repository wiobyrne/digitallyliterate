## Understanding the Changing Landscape of Mind Health

Our mind health – not just mental illness, but the full spectrum of cognitive, emotional, and social functioning-are being shaped by rapid shifts in our social, technological, and cultural environment in ways we’re only beginning to understand. The Global Mind Project is the world’s most comprehensive initiative tracking mind health. By measuring how mind health is changing globally, and what’s driving those changes, we aim to inform a stronger, more resilient future for individuals and societies alike.

**SUPPORT PREVENTATIVE SOLUTIONS** THAT SHIFT THE NEEDLE ON MIND HEALTH

The Global Mind Project uses responses to the MHQ — a free, anonymous assessment that provides a personalized report with scores and recommendations. Unlike traditional mental health tools, the MHQ measures the full spectrum of mind health, capturing both challenges and positive functioning across cognitive, emotional, and social domains.
