Research Reveals Rural Young People Face Unique Digital Mental Health Challenges

Young people today are navigating mental health challenges in a time of constant digital connection. Social media and digital technology are woven into nearly every aspect of their daily lives. For rural young people, experiences with mental health, social media, and help-seeking are shaped by a mix of isolation and opportunity. Digital spaces can serve as both a lifeline and a landscape to navigate with care.

#### “I feel like a lot of young people, rural and suburban and urban, they all experience some type of mental health issue. For rural people, because you don’t really speak much about mental health, you’re not going to reach out and talk to somebody, so you’re kind of internally struggling with that depression or anxiety.”
