# It's the Christian Nationalism

---
I saw a piece yesterday from the always on point Professor Andrew Whitehead showing the correlation between Christian Nationalism and voting for Trump. [You can read it here.](https://open.substack.com/pub/andrewwhitehead/p/religion-and-the-2024-election?r=92vnq&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web)

I wanted to flesh it out just a little bit with maps, and woo boy, once you see it, just like with so many other things, you can’t unsee it.

Here is the US map, color coded and labeled with the percentage of the vote in each state for Donald Trump.

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!B8-a!)

- Blue is an strong outcome for Democrats, where it was a no-brainer for Kamala Harris
- Purplish are close calls either way, some went for Democrats (Harris), some for Republicans (Trump), but close nonetheless
- Maroon went for Republicans and Donald Trump by at least 5 points
- Red are all 60 or more percent for Trump

A sobering map, especially for those of us who live in the Maroon or Red spaces, but we know the whole map is now run by Republicans in all three branches of government.

Now, let’s see what those Maroon and Red spaces believe.

PRRI ran a study in 2023, their [American Values Atlas](https://www.prri.org/research/support-for-christian-nationalism-in-all-50-states/). Among the questions were multiple to gauge levels of support for Christian Nationalism in every state in the union.

PRRI divided up respondents into 4 categories:

- Rejectors of Christian Nationalism (30% across the country)
- Skeptics of Christian Nationalism (37% across the country)
- Sympathizers for Christian Nationalism (20% across the country)
- Adherents for Christian nationalism (10% across the country)

You may read that and think, well heck, that means there are only 30% of Americans are down with Christian Nationalism. And yes, that is a good thing. BUT, damn near every one of that 30% show up and vote in every election. The other 70% of us (3% skipped / didn’t answer the questions in the survey so that’s why the math isn’t quite 100% in the 4 groups) across the country don’t as regularly. So that means the 30% (which is much higher in some states) dominate elections as turnout dips. Depressing turnout has been part of their plan for literally decades. Paul Weyrich told us in 1980.

Just in case you wanted to know the questions that derive the scale / classifications, they are:

- The U.S. government should declare America a Christian nation.
- U.S. laws should be based on Christian values.
- If the U.S. moves away from our Christian foundations, we will not have a country anymore.
- Being Christian is an important part of being truly American.
- God has called Christians to exercise dominion over all areas of American society.

These questions are how the experts have zeroed in on Christian Nationalism, so agreeing / strongly agreeing with the statement puts you into the Sympathizer / Adherent categories.

Now, let’s see what the PRRI data showed us about each state.

Ok, so US states range from a low of 17% of their population in the Sympathizer / Adherent group to a high of 50%. And remember, these people in these two groups vote, so even in places where you see the lower percentages, they can and do dominate elections, seizing levers of power and imposing their ideology / belief on everyone else. Let’s take another peek at the election outcomes.

![](https://christackett.substack.com/p/%7B%22src%22:%22https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/54bf3d37-7794-4a86-aaa7-088debfda890_1912x1388.png%22,%22srcNoWatermark%22:null,%22fullscreen%22:null,%22imageSize%22:null,%22height%22:1057,%22width%22:1456,%22resizeWidth%22:null,%22bytes%22:474027,%22alt%22:null,%22title%22:null,%22type%22:%22image/png%22,%22href%22:null,%22belowTheFold%22:true,%22topImage%22:false,%22internalRedirect%22:null,%22isProcessing%22:false,%22align%22:null,%22offset%22:false%7D)

Go ahead, scroll back and forth and compare the two maps. It is OMG obvious on the overlap. Where there are more Christian Nationalism believers, the results went for Republicans. Where there is a lot less, the results went for Democrats.

So, this pundit class saying “it’s the economy” driving election outcomes are refusing to look below the surface, simply believing the public polling and exit polls, where we totally expect someone to say I’m voting for Republicans because I believe in the racism, xenophobia, and homophobia that animates the party. Yeah, right. “The Economy” is code for their fear of the other, or just their desire to stick it to those who are different than they are. It’s an old story in the United States. It’s a message pushed through churches across the country and the CN media eco-system. Too many are comfortable with the standard narrative and don’t want to open their eyes to a new reality. Christian nationalism and supremacists (white, Christian, male, etc.) have a Venn diagram that overlaps in big ways. You can’t talk about one without knowing you are talking about the others. It ain’t the economy driving, it’s the ideology and fear of other. The economy is the excuse.

Christian nationalism is the root of the rot behind a whole host of the things so many of us are fighting against. Until people understand that, we will be always chasing the weed up top. We have to get below the surface.

We are still fighting for people to See It. They are willing to make excuse after excuse to continue in their bubble. Once you open your eyes, being able to Name It is key, so it’s clear to yourself and others what we are up against. THEN and only then are we ready to Fight It. Once we are on the same page and know the stakes, we can get to the root and pull it out. Otherwise the weeds will keep coming back.

See It. Name It. Fight It.
