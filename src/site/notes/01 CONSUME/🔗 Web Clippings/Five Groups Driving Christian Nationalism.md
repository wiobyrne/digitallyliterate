# Five Groups Driving Christian Nationalism
## Highlights
Christian Nationalism is a movement made up of five distinct groups: Funders, Thinkers, Infantry, Sergeants, and Power Players. Each group plays a different role in advancing the agenda of Christian Nationalism. Funders consist of wealthy individuals who invest in undermining democracy for their own benefit. Thinkers are professionals who push the narrative that a "woke" elite is controlling society. Infantry includes everyday Americans who support Christian nationalist ideas, often driven by fear and misinformation. Sergeants are local leaders who turn money and messages into votes and actions. Power Players are leaders of policy and networking groups who mobilize others around their agendas. Understanding these groups is crucial in fighting back against Christian Nationalism and preserving democracy.

### Key Element from Money, Lies, And God by Katherine Stewart

This movement is at war with itself even as it wages war on the rest of us. It consists of a variety of groups and organizations, each pursing its own agendas, each in thrall to a distinct set of assumptions.

***Funders***

***Thinkers***

***Sergeants***

***Infantry***

***Power Players***

Those are the five groups Katherine Stewart segments those embracing Christian Nationalism into in her new book [“Money, Lies, and God”](https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/money-lies-and-god-9781635578546/), and it’s really helped me with framing things, so I wanted to share a bit more detail from the book (where the descriptions are straight from the book), and then I’ll throw in my two cents below.

## Funders

The Funders come from the minute ranks of beneficiaries of the massive concentration in wealth over the past five decades. People like former secretary of education Betsy DeVos, the Wilks brothers, Rebekah Mercer, Tim Dunn, and the Koch Brothers, and many more, some of whom purposely hide in the shadows. They have chosen to invest their fortunes in the subversion of democracy.

*They believe destroying democracy is a means of creating wealth.*

They are dangerously wrong in their biggest idea— that destroying democracy is a means of creating wealth. The main reason why the Funders are confused about their own genuine interests is that they have outsourced much of their thinking, just as they have outsourced so much else, to other people.

## Thinkers

The Thinkers are a subset of the increasingly insular professional elite that has emerged in the modern American economy. They spend much of their time shuttling around a number of densely connected institutions with anodyne names like the Federalist Society, the Heritage Foundation, James Madison Center, and so on.

*They are the “anti- intellectual intellectuals”*

The Thinkers’ credentials are often thin cover for ferocious levels of aggression and insecurity. They believe the root of all evil in modern society is a supposedly all-controlling “woke” elite that cancels right-wing speakers at campus events and controls the rest of the nation from the back rooms of diversity offices.

The Thinkers themselves represent a far more powerful professional elite, sustained in a lavish welfare system at a network of think tanks and advocacy groups, and serving at the pleasure of the billionaires who pay their salaries.

## Infantry

Millions of Americans, many in the middle and lower- middle sections of the nation’s widening economic, educational, and regional divides. This group is large and diverse, and includes many different identities, ideas, and agendas.

They hope to save the nation by banning books with LGBT or sex- related themes from school libraries (even when such books are nowhere to be found), or by suppressing instruction on the brutal history of slavery and segregation in America.

You will find many of them in the pews of America’s hard-line churches, where radicalized pastors nurture a cohort of “spirit warriors” intent on waging battle with the moderate / liberal / left “demons” that have purportedly commandeered the political process.

The Infantry includes many of those that the knowledge economy left behind, the people who get riled up with rhetoric about “elites.”

*Their role is to supply the Funders, Thinkers, and key players with enough votes to win.*

## Sargents

A special group of unit leaders inside the infantry who turn the movement’s money and messages into votes and political action at the local level.

*This group includes culture warriors moonlighting as school board members and “moms” who think “liberty” means banning books they don’t like. But the least appreciated subset consists of the tens of thousands of pastors at America’s conservative churches.*

Not all Sergeants are evangelical. Indeed, they are not all Christian; among the Sergeant cohort you will find some people who are not religious at all.

## Power Players

Leaders of the Christian nationalist movement’s policy and networking groups, legal advocacy organizations, messaging initiatives, and other features, who amass tremendous personal power by mobilizing others around their agendas.

Some are celebrity preachers that outgrew their local congregations and took on a national pro.le, on the model of Jerry Falwell of the Moral Majority or D. James Kennedy of Coral Ridge Ministries. Others are super-lobbyists with tremendous influence on elections and elected politicians, like Ralph Reed of the Faith and Freedom Coalition and Tony Perkins of the Family Research Council. Many of them get together at Council for National Policy or Ziklag gatherings, or at the National Prayer Breakfast, where they trade favors on the path to still greater power.

Most sit astride organizations with budgets in the tens and hundreds of millions of dollars, command media and pastoral ministries that reach tens or hundreds of millions of Infantry and have the ear of presidents and other political leaders.

*They are the operational masterminds of the antidemocratic movement, and their organizations turn the Funders’ money and the Infantry’s votes into political power.*

The Funders might share the Christian nationalist mindset with their followers but they certainly don’t have to, and many do not. Some identify with other religious traditions, and some appear to have confessed to no religion more than the worship of money. the core of their belief system is that democracy in its current configuration threatens their power and privilege.

Some of the Thinkers are even less committed to specific faith traditions than their rich patrons. One branch is essentially atheistic, another espouses hard- line Catholicism; some are Jewish, and many don’t appear to have much personal interest in religion. They leave the Christian nationalism and all that for the little people whom they half- heartedly pretend to care about. They may be against the “woke” elite, but they aren’t against elites as such.

They see themselves as members of a new elite, destined to rule over a population that can never be brought to reason or virtue on its own.

All of those elements are in the introduction to the book, so I haven’t spoiled anything that you will dig into and learn as you read the rest of it (and you really should). Here is my take on illustrating the interconnected nature of the five (5) groups.

I think it’s important to understand how this plays out in the spaces we live. In Texas, we are currently in the midst of a multi-year battle over implementing vouchers, providing taxpayer money for students to attend private religious schools.

**Funders** in this fight are Tim Dunn, Jeff Yass, and Betsy DeVos (or at least her org American Federation for Children, which she led for years)

**Thinkers** are those in AFC, the Texas Public Policy Foundation, and a host of others embedded in right wing think tanks publishing pro-voucher propaganda.

**Power Players** are frankly the Governor of Texas, using his bully pulpit (and the money from Yass) to attempt to push things across a finish line, people like Lance Wallnau and Rafael Cruz, and others behind the scenes ensuring the propaganda gets filtered throughout their eco-system.

**Sargents** are people like Corey DeAngelis and other twitter warriors like him, as well as networks of faith based groups who see vouchers as a massive boon for their goals.

**Infantry** are those voting for Republicans. It’s that simple.

Looking at this beyond just vouchers, but into things like local government, and the takeover of school boards, city councils, county commissioners, etc., the same core structure is maintained, meaning the same five groups, but who plays in them may be different.

At the local level, the Funders likely aren’t Dunn, Yass, and DeVos, but people who are emulating them, leveraging the same models. They rely on many of the same Thinker groups, as they are the ones creating the framework to demonize and demoralize those different than them, and elevate and indoctrinate their way of thinking, all while lining their pockets. Everything else simply scales to meet the scope of where it is playing, with Power Players, Sargents, and Infantry.

Once you understand that core structure playing out all around, you can begin to formulate how to fight back.

This is again, See it. Name it. Fight it.

We all have different roles we can play in working to preserve our freedoms, our institutions, and our democracy. We are under fire at all levels. Get involved where you can and make sure you are raising your voice in your community, in your peer groups, and on your social media.

And go read ***Money, Lies, and God***. Knowledge is power.
