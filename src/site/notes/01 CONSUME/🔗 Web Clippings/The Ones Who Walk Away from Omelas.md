# The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas 



---
" **The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas** " ([/ ˈ oʊ m ə ˌ l ɑː s /](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English "Help:IPA/English") [^1]) is a 1973 short work of [philosophical fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_fiction "Philosophical fiction") by American writer [Ursula K. Le Guin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursula_K._Le_Guin "Ursula K. Le Guin"). With deliberately both vague and vivid descriptions, the narrator depicts a [summer festival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midsummer_festival "Midsummer festival") in the [utopian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopian "Utopian") city of Omelas, whose prosperity depends on the perpetual misery of a single child.[^2] "The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas" was nominated for the [Locus Award for Best Short Fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_Award_for_Best_Short_Story "Locus Award for Best Short Story") in 1974 [^3] and won the [Hugo Award for Best Short Story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Award_for_Best_Short_Story "Hugo Award for Best Short Story") in 1974.[^4]

## Plot

The only chronological element of the work is that it begins by describing the first day of summer in Omelas, a shimmering city of unbelievable happiness and delight. In Omelas, the [summer solstice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_solstice "Summer solstice") is celebrated with a glorious festival and a race featuring young people on horseback. The vibrant festival atmosphere, however, seems to be an everyday characteristic of the blissful community, whose citizens, though limited in their technology and resources, are still intelligent, sophisticated, and cultured. Omelas has no kings, soldiers, priests, or slaves. The specific socio-politico-economic setup of the community is not mentioned; the narrator merely claims not to be sure of every particular.

The narrator reflects that, "Omelas sounds in my words like a city in a fairy tale, long ago and far away, once upon a time. Perhaps it would be best if you imagined it as your own fancy bids, assuming it will rise to the occasion, for certainly I cannot suit you all." Everything about Omelas is so abundantly pleasing that the narrator decides the reader is not truly convinced of its existence and so elaborates upon the final element of the city: its one atrocity. The city's constant state of serenity and splendor requires that a single unfortunate child be kept in perpetual filth, darkness, and misery.

Once citizens are old enough to know the truth, most, though initially shocked and disgusted, ultimately acquiesce to this one injustice that secures the happiness of the rest of the city. However, some citizens, young and old, walk away from the city after seeing the child. Each is alone, and no one knows where they go, but none come back. The story ends by stating, "The place they go towards is a place even less imaginable to most of us than the city of happiness. I cannot describe it at all. It is possible it does not exist. But they seem to know where they are going, the ones who walk away from Omelas."

Le Guin’s short story explores the ideas of [utilitarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism "Utilitarianism"). Le Guin stated that the city's name is pronounced " *OH-meh-lahss* ".[^5] Le Guin hit upon the name of the town on seeing a road sign for [Salem, Oregon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salem,_Oregon "Salem, Oregon"), in a car mirror. "\[… People ask me\] 'Where *do* you get your ideas from, Ms. Le Guin?' From forgetting Dostoyevsky and reading road signs backwards, naturally. Where else?" [^6]

"The central idea of this psychomyth, the [scapegoat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scapegoat "Scapegoat") ", writes Le Guin, "turns up in [Dostoyevsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fyodor_Dostoevsky "Fyodor Dostoevsky") 's *[Brothers Karamazov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Brothers_Karamazov "The Brothers Karamazov")*, and several people have asked me, rather suspiciously, why I gave the credit to [William James](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_James "William James"). The fact is, I haven't been able to re-read Dostoyevsky, much as I loved him, since I was twenty-five, and I'd simply forgotten he used the idea. But when I met it in James' ' [The Moral Philosopher and the Moral Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Moral_Philosopher_and_the_Moral_Life "The Moral Philosopher and the Moral Life") ', it was with a shock of recognition."

The quote from William James is:

> Or if the hypothesis were offered us of a world in which Messrs. [Fourier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Fourier "Charles Fourier") 's and [Bellamy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Bellamy "Edward Bellamy") 's and [Morris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Morris "William Morris") 's [utopias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopia "Utopia") should all be outdone, and millions kept permanently happy on the one simple condition that a certain lost soul on the far-off edge of things should lead a life of lonely torture, what except a sceptical and independent sort of emotion can it be which would make us immediately feel, even though an impulse arose within us to clutch at the happiness so offered, how hideous a thing would be its enjoyment when deliberately accepted as the fruit of such a bargain?[^6] [^7]

As for the original Dostoyevsky quote, [Charlie Jane Anders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Jane_Anders "Charlie Jane Anders") of *Gizmodo* notes:[^8]

> In *Karamazov*, Dovstoevsky poses the problem of the Tortured Child:
> 
> "Tell me yourself — I challenge you: let’s assume that you were called upon to build the edifice of human destiny so that men would finally be happy and would find peace and tranquility. If you knew that, in order to attain this, you would have to torture just one single creature, let’s say the little girl who beat her chest so desperately in the outhouse, and that on her unavenged tears you could build that edifice, would you agree to do it? Tell me and don’t lie!"
> 
> "No I would not," Alyosha said softly.

[Dostoyevsky's original description of the dilemma](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/The_Grand_Inquisitor/Rebellion_\(Part_2\)#Part_8 "wikibooks:The Grand Inquisitor/Rebellion (Part 2)") refers to the [doctrine of salvation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvation_in_Christianity "Salvation in Christianity") through the [crucifixion of Jesus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crucifixion_of_Jesus "Crucifixion of Jesus").

## Publication history

Le Guin's piece was originally published in *[New Dimensions 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Dimensions_3 "New Dimensions 3")*, a hardcover science fiction anthology edited by [Robert Silverberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Silverberg "Robert Silverberg"), in October 1973. It was reprinted in Le Guin's *[The Wind's Twelve Quarters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wind%27s_Twelve_Quarters "The Wind's Twelve Quarters")* in 1975, and has been frequently anthologized elsewhere.[^9] It has also appeared as an independently published, 31-page hardcover book for young adults in 1993.[^10]

It was republished in the second volume of the short-story anthology *[The Unreal and the Real](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Unreal_and_the_Real "The Unreal and the Real")* in 2012.[^11] Le Guin noted in that collection that "The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas" "has a long and happy career of being used by teachers to upset students and make them argue fiercely about morality." [^5]

## Cultural legacy

"The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas" has inspired a variety of follow-up works and cultural references.[^12]

Designers [Ricardo Bare](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ricardo_Bare&action=edit&redlink=1 "Ricardo Bare (page does not exist)") and [Harvey Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Smith_\(game_designer\) "Harvey Smith (game designer)") of the *[Dishonored](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dishonored_\(series\) "Dishonored (series)")* video game series drew on the story as inspiration for the supernatural being [The Outsider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Outsider_\(Dishonored\) "The Outsider (Dishonored)"), an omnipotent immortal reviled as an avatar of evil.[^13]

Artist Andrew DeGraff illustrated a map visualizing Le Guin's story in 2015 book *Plotted: A Literary Atlas*. DeGraff wrote that: "Le Guin provides us with the building blocks to construct the city of Omelas, but if we want to forsake it afterward, then we too have to strike out alone." [^14]

The 2017 music video for " [Spring Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_Day_\(song\) "Spring Day (song)") " by South Korean [band](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Band_\(rock_and_pop\) "Band (rock and pop)") [BTS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BTS "BTS") references Le Guin's short story, both thematically and in displaying a hotel named 'Omelas'.[^15] [^16]

[N. K. Jemisin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N._K._Jemisin "N. K. Jemisin") 's 2018 collection *[How Long 'til Black Future Month?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_Long_%27til_Black_Future_Month%3F "How Long 'til Black Future Month?")* opens with a piece titled " [The Ones Who Stay and Fight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_Long_%27til_Black_Future_Month%3F#Synopsis_and_format "How Long 'til Black Future Month?") ", which is a direct response to Le Guin's story. In an interview with *[The Paris Review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Paris_Review "The Paris Review")*, the writer stated that many readers misunderstand Le Guin as arguing that the only way to create a better society is to leave, and that in fact Le Guin was arguing that one has to "fix" their society, "especially when there's nowhere to walk away to." [^17] Jemisin's 2022 novel *[The World We Make](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N._K._Jemisin#Great_Cities_Series "N. K. Jemisin")* makes allusion to the story as well, using the descriptor "Omelasian" in reference to children being captive in a basement.[^18]

Joe George argued that the 2019 film [*Us*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Us_\(2019_film\) "Us (2019 film)") was influenced by both Le Guin's short story as well as [Octavia E. Butler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octavia_E._Butler "Octavia E. Butler") 's " [Speech Sounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_Sounds "Speech Sounds") ".[^19]

's 2020 novel *Pew* begins with an epigraph from "The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas", quoting the last paragraph of the story.[^20] The novel itself is heavily tied to Le Guin's work, with several key similarities present.[^21]

Executive producers and co-showrunners [Michelle Paradise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Paradise "Michelle Paradise") and [Alex Kurtzman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Kurtzman "Alex Kurtzman") cited Le Guin's short story as inspiration for the plot line of the third season of [*Star Trek: Discovery*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_Discovery_\(season_3\) "Star Trek: Discovery (season 3)"), with Kurtzman noting that both creators were interested in the central dilemma being solely caused by a child.[^22] Several reviewers also noted a strong similarity between the story and the episode "Lift Us Where Suffering Cannot Reach" of *[Star Trek: Strange New Worlds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_Strange_New_Worlds "Star Trek: Strange New Worlds")* first season*.* Reviewer Anthony Pascale called the episode "almost a beat-for-beat recreation" of Le Guin's work.[^23] On the satirical website [Cracked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cracked.com "Cracked.com"), JM McNab pointed out the long history of Le Guin's influence on the Star Trek franchise and that while the writers of *Star Trek: Discovery* did name a ship after her, the honor is "still not as good as being credited".[^24]

The 2022 fantasy novel *[The Golden Enclaves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Golden_Enclaves "The Golden Enclaves")* by [Naomi Novik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naomi_Novik "Naomi Novik") features a dilemma similar to the one presented in "The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas." [^25] [Isabel J. Kim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isabel_J._Kim "Isabel J. Kim") 's short story " [Why Don't We Just Kill the Kid In the Omelas Hole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_Don%27t_We_Just_Kill_the_Kid_In_the_Omelas_Hole "Why Don't We Just Kill the Kid In the Omelas Hole") ", published in *[Clarkesworld Magazine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarkesworld_Magazine "Clarkesworld Magazine")* in February 2024, is set after the events of Le Guin's story.[^26] It discusses a third option besides staying in Omelas or walking away: killing the suffering child (described by one of the murderers as a form of [accelerationism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerationism "Accelerationism")).
