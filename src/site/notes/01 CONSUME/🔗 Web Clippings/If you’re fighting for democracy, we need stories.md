# If you’re fighting for democracy, we need stories


1/10 If you’re fighting for democracy, here’s the truth: 🧾 Policy briefs won’t save us 📊 Facts alone won’t persuade 🧠 Logic isn’t enough We need stories. Emotional ones. Ones that move people to act. Here’s how to tell strategic stories 🧵 [#Voices4Victory](https://bsky.app/hashtag/Voices4Victory) [#DemVoice1](https://bsky.app/hashtag/DemVoice1) [#USDemocracy](https://bsky.app/hashtag/USDemocracy) [#ProudBlue](https://bsky.app/hashtag/ProudBlue)

2/10 Disinformation spreads because it’s emotional. It’s not trying to inform, it’s trying to trigger a reaction. Fear, anger, tribal loyalty. That’s what makes it contagious. If we want to inoculate against it, we need emotionally truthful stories that stick before the lie can.

3/10 🔥 Step one: Lead with values and emotion. Hope. Empathy. Belonging. Unity. Don’t just say, “climate change is real.” Say, “We want clean air for our kids. We want to protect the places we love.” Emotion is the hook. Shared values are the glue that makes truth stick.

4/10 📚 Step two: Use a clear narrative arc. 🎭 Villain: not just a person, but a harmful system (disinfo, billionaires, greed, manipulation) 🧍‍♂️ Victim: real people affected 🎯 Goal: a future we build together Stories bypass facts and logic, creating lasting emotional clarity.

5/10 👥 Step three: You are the messenger. You don’t need a platform. You don’t need a title. You have people who trust you, your family, friends, coworkers, book club, group chat. Use your voice. Tell your story. Truth spreads best when it comes from someone we already believe.

6/10 🍞 Step four: Use a “Truth Sandwich.” ✅ Open with the clear, verified truth ⚠️ Briefly explain the lie and how it works ✅ Close with the full truth again Never just repeat the lie. Show how it manipulates. People remember tactics more than corrections. H/T

7/10 🧠 Step five: Teach emotional skepticism. Disinfo hijacks emotions to bypass thought. Help people pause and ask, “Why am I being triggered? Who benefits from this?” Games like Bad News help people build resistance before the lie ever reaches them. That’s how we inoculate. [www.getbadnews.com/en](https://www.getbadnews.com/en)


8/10 🔁 Step six: Repeat the truth, loudly, visually, and often. Disinfo wins through saturation. We counter it with consistent, emotionally grounded repetition. Slogans. Visuals. Stories. Say it a hundred ways, a hundred times. Repetition builds belief. It’s that simple.

9/10 🛠️ Step seven: Give people agency. Debunking alone is not enough. Offer actions. Every story should end with something they can do. “Share this.” “Join us.” “Speak up.” People don’t want to feel helpless. Give them a role in protecting the truth.

10/10 This is how we fight back: Not with charts & bullet points, but with story & emotion. With clarity, not complexity. With repetition, not reaction. Because democracy won’t be saved by data, it will be saved by people who know how to tell the truth well.
