# Identifying and scaling AI  use cases


As the deployment of artificial intelligence accelerates across industries, a recurring challenge for enterprises is determining how to operationalize AI in a way that generates measurable impact. To support this need, OpenAI has published a comprehensive, process-oriented guide titled *“ **[Identifying and Scaling AI Use Cases](https://cdn.openai.com/business-guides-and-resources/identifying-and-scaling-ai-use-cases.pdf)**.”* Drawing from over 300 implementation case studies and insights from more than two million enterprise users, the guide offers a systematic approach to identifying, evaluating, and deploying AI across organizational functions.

### A Structured Process for AI Integration

The guide introduces a three-phase methodology:

1. **Identifying High-Leverage Opportunities** – Recognize where AI can directly augment existing business processes.
2. **Teaching Six Foundational Use Case Primitives** – Provide teams with a framework for experimentation and adoption.
3. **Prioritizing Initiatives for Scale** – Use structured evaluation methods to focus efforts on use cases with favorable return-to-effort ratios.

This framework is designed to support organizations at various stages of maturity, from early experimentation to scaled deployment.

### Phase 1: Identifying Opportunities for AI Impact

The first phase emphasizes examining routine inefficiencies and cognitive bottlenecks across workflows. The guide highlights three categories where AI tends to be most effective:

- **Repetitive, Low-Value Tasks**: Automating tasks such as drafting summaries, monitoring KPIs, and creating reports allows teams to refocus on higher-level priorities.
- **Skill Bottlenecks**: AI can bridge knowledge gaps—enabling employees to work across domains without waiting for interdepartmental support.
- **Ambiguous or Open-Ended Problems**: AI can be used to generate ideas, suggest starting points, or interpret unstructured data in scenarios where human decision-making often stalls.

These categories provide a lens for assessing workflows and initiating structured ideation, often in the form of use case workshops or cross-functional task forces.

### Phase 2: Teaching Core AI Use Case Primitives

Based on analysis of over 600 real-world use cases, OpenAI outlines six foundational “primitives” that encapsulate common and scalable applications of AI:

- **Content Creation**: Drafting policy documents, product descriptions, and marketing copy with consistency in tone and structure.
- **Research**: Performing structured information retrieval and synthesis, often from long documents or web sources.
- **Coding**: Assisting in debugging, code translation, and first-draft generation across multiple programming languages.
- **Data Analysis**: Harmonizing and interpreting datasets from spreadsheets or dashboards to produce visualizations or trend summaries.
- **Ideation and Strategy**: Supporting brainstorming, plan formulation, and structured critique of proposals or documents.
- **Automation**: Designing repeatable workflows that handle inputs and generate outputs according to predefined rules or templates.

Each primitive includes domain-specific examples that demonstrate its cross-functional utility. For instance, finance teams may automate executive reporting, while product managers use AI to prototype user interfaces or prepare documentation.

### Phase 3: Prioritization Through an Impact-Effort Framework

To transition from ideation to implementation, OpenAI recommends an Impact/Effort matrix. This tool segments use cases into four categories:

- **Quick Wins**: High-impact, low-effort projects that can be deployed quickly.
- **Self-Service**: Use cases requiring minimal effort, often deployed individually or within small teams.
- **Strategic Projects**: High-effort, high-impact initiatives that may transform processes but require more planning and resourcing.
- **Deferred Initiatives**: Use cases that are complex and low value under current conditions, though they may become feasible as technology evolves.

Several companies cited in the guide have applied this framework. Tinder enabled product teams to interface with their CLI using natural language, while Morgan Stanley deployed AI to summarize research reports for advisors. These examples demonstrate the diversity of applications that fit within the same prioritization structure.

### From Task Automation to Workflow-Level Integration

The guide also addresses the shift from individual task augmentation to full workflow automation. OpenAI suggests mapping multi-step processes—for example, a marketing campaign lifecycle—from research and data analysis through to content generation and distribution. This systems-level view prepares organizations for more autonomous agentic workflows in the near future.

### Final Considerations

OpenAI’s guide offers a structured and technically grounded approach to AI adoption. Rather than focusing on abstract potential, it emphasizes practical integration aligned with organizational needs and capacities. By promoting internal capability-building and prioritization discipline, it supports the development of scalable, sustainable AI infrastructure within the enterprise.

For teams seeking to advance beyond isolated experiments, the guide functions as a blueprint for systematic rollout—anchored in real use cases and measurable impact.
