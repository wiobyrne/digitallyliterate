# Timeline of Gamergate


**Gamergate** is what happened when the [reactionary](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Reactionary "Reactionary") rejects of [4chan](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/4chan "4chan") teamed up to be the personal army of an abuser and attack women who make and write about [video games](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Video_game "Video game") with a molecule-thin veneer of being a consumer movement for "free speech" and "ethics in video game journalism". These are their stories.

## 2014

### August 2014

- August 15: **Eron Gjoni** 's early draft of his diatribe against his ex-partner **Zoe Quinn** appears on *Something Awful*, *Penny Arcade*, and other websites. [He gets banned from them as a result](https://archive.ph/J8tos).
- August 16:
	- **Eron Gjoni** publishes ["The Zoe Post"](https://archive.ph/MeIYt) on Wordpress, accusing **Zoe Quinn** of infidelity. This time the post is shared to **4chan** 's boards [/b/, /v/, /pol/, and /r9k/](https://archive.ph/m2fmN).
		(Note: According to the [IRC logs](http://puu.sh/boAEC/f072f259b6.txt) "The Zoe Post" was later edited by Gjoni; Gjoni's original accusations were later [debunked by himself](https://archive.ph/6edzX).)
	- **4chan** users [already begin to form](https://web.archive.org/web/20170720015306/https://storify.com/davidsgallant/the-origins-of-gamergate) their preferred narrative for Gamergate, insisting that they focus on the **Nathan Grayson** claim, as well as the other alleged partners, rather than use misogynistic insults to attack **Zoe Quinn**, as the mob wants to turn Quinn's " [social justice warrior](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Social_justice_warrior "Social justice warrior") " allies against them.[^1]
	- **Eron Gjoni** pretends to condemn the harassment against **Zoe Quinn**, while also [admitting that he spread his blog on various forums such as Penny Arcade and Something Awful](https://archive.ph/BN6Rx) specifically in order to create a backlash against his ex.
	- **MundaneMatt** [publishes a video based on "The Zoe Post"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5CXOafuTXM). The video is shortly unavailable. MundaneMatt claims that this is due to a DMCA claim against his video by **Zoe Quinn**. The claim in question is horribly written and not something one would expect a proper claimant to make.
		(Note: The tactic to use false DMCA claims as a means to discredit an opponent had been pioneered by hacker, white supremacist and former GNAA leader [Andrew "weev" Auernheimer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/weev "wp:weev") during [his harassment campaign against game developer Kathy Sierra.](http://www.wired.com/2014/10/trolls-will-always-win/))
- August 17:
	- **Eron Gjoni** also [spreads his defamation in the forums of ***The Escapist***](http://www.escapistmagazine.com/forums/read/18.858347-Zoe-Quinn-and-the-surrounding-controversy#21276142), finding an audience willing to listen to him. *The Escapist* 's forums would be a major hub for proto-Gamergate activity, despite [attempts by the staff to contain the bile](http://www.escapistmagazine.com/forums/read/18.858347-Zoe-Quinn-and-the-surrounding-controversy?page=121#21296963).
	- The first larger Reddit community to pick up on **Eron Gjoni** 's defamation is **/r/TumblrinAction**, which [rehashes a previous shitstorm](http://np.reddit.com/r/TumblrInAction/comments/2dt5hu/depression_quest_dev_claims_harassment_and/) against **Zoe Quinn** [started by the Wizardchan community](https://twitter.com/TheQuinnspiracy/status/411637304462036992) in 2013.
- August 18:
	- [**MundaneMatt** and others gather in the #BurgersAndFries IRC channel and begin organizing a harassment campaign](http://puu.sh/boAEC/f072f259b6.txt) against **Zoe Quinn**, giving it its first name: "The Quinnspiracy." They immediately start talking about doxxing Quinn and others. In their own words, "WE'RE CRASHING \[QUINN'S\] CAREER WITH NO SURVIVORS" \[see [IRC logs](http://puu.sh/boAEC/f072f259b6.txt) @ Aug 18 17.23.09\]. The mob coordinates with **Internet Aristocrat** (among others) in the release of his video.
	- **John "TotalBiscuit" Bain**, host of *The Cynical Brit* YouTube channel, [is contacted by members of the #BurgersAndFries channel](https://archive.ph/YpYc7).
	- **Internet Aristocrat** (later known as Mister Metokur) releases his first video with the material provided by **Eron Gjoni** ([still available on this mirror](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zz--i3M4PVk)).
	- #burgersandfries discusses migration to 8chan, after 4chan mods keep deleting the **Zoe Quinn doxx**. The /burgers/ forum on 8chan, precursor to /gg/ and /gamergate/, is created \[see [IRC logs](http://puu.sh/boAEC/f072f259b6.txt) @ Aug 18 18.34.33\].
	- **John "TotalBiscuit" Bain** propagates the slander against **Zoe Quinn** [to his more than 350.000 followers on Twitter](https://archive.ph/okgdJ), based on the "Zoe Post," the video by **Internet Aristocrat** and possibly information from the IRC members. He is [heavily criticized by independent game developers](http://gamesnosh.com/the-ugly-side-of-justice-total-biscuit-denounced-over-zoe-quinn-scandal-comments/) in reaction.
- August 19:
	- **Zoe Quinn**, having [been doxxed on /v/](https://twitter.com/TheQuinnspiracy/status/501680676014272513), is harassed [via phone calls to their family](https://twitter.com/TheQuinnspiracy/status/501733766239252480).
	- **The Fine Young Capitalists** ' Matthew Rappard [claims on Reddit](http://i.imgur.com/Gy2n50g.png) that **Zoe Quinn** sabotaged their game jam and doxxed him, without providing any proof (the claims he made under his username SillySladar were deleted and/or edited later on). [His call for support is spread on Reddit](http://np.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/2e6ops/the_fine_young_capitalists_creators_of_a/) and 4chan. His accusations seem to be based upon [a conversation with Zoe Quinn from March, compiled by /u/metroidcomposite](https://web.archive.org/web/20170621081742/https://storify.com/metroidcomposit/the-conversation-between-zoe-and-tfyc-on-january-2), that apparently was settled in private.
	- A [Reddit thread on /r/gaming/ about **John "TotalBiscuit" Bain** 's hitpiece gets mass-deleted](http://np.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/2dz0gs/totalbiscuit_discusses_the_state_of_games/) due to witch-hunting (a breach of global Reddit rules). This was used as an example of "censorship" and "collusion" between Reddit and **Zoe Quinn**, after one [/r/gaming mod warns Quinn about the on-going doxxing in the thread](http://imgur.com/tDXsFbD).
	- Polytron founder **Phil Fish** [calls out](http://egmr.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/zFBoyuZ.png) **John "TotalBiscuit" Bain** for his attack on **Zoe Quinn** and becomes a target for harassment in the process.
- August 20:
	- **Stephen Totilo**, editor-in-chief of ***Kotaku***, [debunks the claim](https://archive.ph/8KjOG) that **Zoe Quinn** 's personal relationship with staff writer **Nathan Grayson** (one of the few partners named by **Eron Gjoni** in "The Zoe Post") resulted in any positive reviews for *Depression Quest*, an interactive fiction that Quinn developed as no such review exists on the site and [the only article ever written by Grayson that mentions Quinn](https://archive.ph/ykZbo) wasn't even about *Depression Quest*.
	- Game developer site ***NeoGAF*** [cracks down on users](https://archive.ph/thhAh) who persistently defend the doxxing and harassment of **Zoe Quinn**, resulting in accusations of censorship, etc. GamerGate despises *NeoGAF* from this day forth.
- August 21:
	- In the #BurgersAndFries IRC channel, the organizers [celebrate obtaining **Phil Fish** 's "home" folder](http://i.imgur.com/tml5SKH.png) and discuss how to take control of his website, hosted by Cloudflare \[see [IRC logs](http://puu.sh/boAEC/f072f259b6.txt) @ Aug 22 02.34.26\]. After immense harassment, Fish [puts his company and the IP rights to its game *Fez* up for sale](http://venturebeat.com/2014/08/22/hackers-post-fez-developer-phil-fishs-personal-information-and-take-control-of-his-studios-website/) and then [leaves social media and game development](http://www.dailydot.com/geek/4chan-hacks-phil-fish-over-his-defense-of-zoe-quinn/).
	- The same people [also attempt to penetrate](https://archive.ph/nFMLG) **Zoe Quinn** 's accounts but with less success.
	- **4chan** 's /pol/ board gets behind funding **The Fine Young Capitalists'** current crowdfunding campaign, nicknaming it ["Operation Chemo"](http://i.imgur.com/E7XZaKz.png), because they would "attack the cancer" (feminism), which they think would make them "PR-untouchable".
- August 22:
	- Gamergate's mascot, [Vivian James](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/vivian-james), is created on **4chan** 's /v/ board, with a color scheme based on the rape joke "Daily Dose"/"Piccolo Dick" (see [IRC logs](http://puu.sh/boAEC/f072f259b6.txt) @ Aug 24 19.54.13).
	- *The Daily Dot* becomes one of the first publications [to report on the doxxing and hacking](http://www.dailydot.com/geek/4chan-hacks-phil-fish-over-his-defense-of-zoe-quinn/) of **Zoe Quinn** and **Phil Fish**.
	- **4chan** starts to clean out its boards, possibly due to the negative press after the hack of **Phil Fish** and **Zoe Quinn** \[see [IRC logs](http://puu.sh/boAEC/f072f259b6.txt) @ Aug 22 16.02.37\].
	- **8chan** admin **Fredrick "Hotwheels" Brennan** shows up in the #BurgersAndFries IRC channel under the name "copypaste" in order to inform the others [that he was contacted](https://archive.ph/XIDdC) by **Zoe Quinn** 's lawyers (see [IRC logs](http://puu.sh/boAEC/f072f259b6.txt) @ Aug 22 10.34.29). He suggests the group move to 8chan.
- August 23: **Internet Aristocrat** publishes his second video \[now deleted, see below\].
- August 24:
	- **Eron Gjoni** [is contacted](http://imgur.com/tU931L8) by members of #BurgersAndFries and shortly joins the IRC channel (see [IRC logs](http://puu.sh/boAEC/f072f259b6.txt) @ Aug 24 20.08.20). He admits that he does not care about journalism and with regards to **Nathan Grayson**, he "mentioned Nathan worked for kotaku because I figured I'd leave the community to make what it wanted out of the implications". (see [IRC logs](http://puu.sh/boAEC/f072f259b6.txt) @ Aug 24 23.59.42)
	- Under the nickname "PaperDinosaur", an editor of ***TechRaptor*** joins the IRC (see [IRC log](http://puu.sh/boAEC/f072f259b6.txt) @ Aug 24 14.51.01) and coordinates the efforts of his site with the group there. (He gets banned on August 31, due to infighting with other members of the group.)
	- **/r/KotakuInAction**, one of Gamergate's future main hubs, is founded in order to gather those who "demand reform" or - as the IRC puts it - "reddit mods made a subreddit for zoe stuff" (see [IRC logs](http://puu.sh/boAEC/f072f259b6.txt) Aug 24 16.50.18). The first scoop is the [exposition of a friendship](http://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/2egtwq/everyones_favorite_game_journalist_sjw_lives_with/) between ***Kotaku*** journalist Patricia Hernandez and game developer Anna Anthropy\].
	- The crowdfunding campaign of [**The Fine Young Capitalists** gets closed](http://i.imgur.com/EKNGSDJ.jpg). TFYC blame this on **Zoe Quinn** later on without providing any proof.
	- **[Davis Aurini](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Davis_Aurini "Davis Aurini")** and **Jordan Owen** [announce their planned documentary](http://wehuntedthemammoth.com/2014/08/24/a-proposed-new-anti-anita-sarkeesian-documentary-promises-to-give-voice-to-the-loudest-silent-majority-the-world-has-ever-known/) to take down **[Anita Sarkeesian](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Anita_Sarkeesian "Anita Sarkeesian")**. Their price? [US$15 thousand a month](https://www.patreon.com/thesarkeesianeffect), minimum.
- August 25:
	- **Eron Gjoni** [does an AMA on /r/drama](https://archive.ph/bCvHO) and reveals **Zoe Quinn** 's usernames and passwords to the mob.
	- **Anita Sarkeesian** posts a new episode in her *Tropes vs. Women in Video Games* series ["Women as Background Decoration Part 2"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5i_RPr9DwMA), and becomes another [major target for Gamergate](https://twitter.com/femfreq/status/504718160902492160) (not that they didn't hate her already).
- August 26:
	- ***Polygon*** updates its [ethics policy to include Patreon support](http://www.polygon.com/forums/meta/2014/8/26/6071669/on-patreon-support). Gamergate claims this as a victory.
	- ***Kotaku*** publishes a [blog post about possible ethical breaches](http://kotaku.com/a-brief-note-about-the-continued-discussion-about-kotak-1627041269). Gamergate claims this as a victory.
	- Due to the ongoing massive harassment and threats, **Anita Sarkeesian** [contacts authorities](https://twitter.com/femfreq/status/504503232672960512), later revealed to be the FBI. (This becomes [later on part of a larger FBI investigation](http://www.polygon.com/2014/9/17/6225835/fbi-investigating-anita-sarkeesian-threats).)
	- An argument between game developer **Tim Schafer** and Let's Play YouTuber **[Jon "JonTron" Jafari](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/JonTron "JonTron")** over **Anita Sarkeesian** 's newest video leads to the creation of the [proto-Gamergate hashtag #IStandWithJonTron](http://archive.ph/u3vQK), also setting the stage for [the first attempts to connect the proto-Gamergate Twitter activists](https://archive.ph/Ng2rj). After Gamergate's formation, they claim JonTron as one of their own because in Gamergate's mind, anyone who disagrees with an " [SJW](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/SJW "SJW") " (in this case Schafer and Sarkeesian) is automatically one of them.
		(Side note: Three years later, JonTron would actually come out of the [alt-right](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Alt-right "Alt-right") closet during a debate with fellow gamer [Destiny](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Destiny_\(person\) "Destiny (person)").)
- August 27:
	- Ongoing [death threats](https://twitter.com/femfreq/status/504718160902492160) force **Anita Sarkeesian** to leave her home temporarily.
	- **Zoe Quinn** [reveals that they too have left their home in fear](https://twitter.com/TheQuinnspiracy/status/504807460780396544); the mob mocks them relentlessly.
	- **Adam Baldwin** coins the [hashtag #GamerGate, linking to the videos by the **Internet Aristocrat**](https://archive.ph/zqYJd) (and not reacting to the articles from the next day, as many Gamergaters claim).
- August 28:
	- Reacting to the ongoing toxicity, **Leigh Alexander** publishes the article ["'Gamers' don't have to be your audience. 'Gamers' are over."](http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/224400/Gamers_dont_have_to_be_your_audience_Gamers_are_over.php) on ***Gamasutra*** The article gets lots of reception among fellow journalists and gets reframed by a variety of journalists in the following days.
		1. Chris Plante for *Polygon* 's ["An awful week to care about video games"](http://www.polygon.com/2014/8/28/6078391/video-games-awful-week)

		4. Luke Plunkett for *Kotaku* 's ["We Might Be Witnessing The 'Death of An Identity'"](http://kotaku.com/we-might-be-witnessing-the-death-of-an-identity-1628203079)
		5. Joseph Bernstein for *BuzzFeed* 's ["Gaming Is Leaving “Gamers” Behind"](http://www.buzzfeed.com/josephbernstein/gaming-is-leaving-gamers-behind#.pa72GyLbP)
		6. Patrick O'Rourke for *Financial Post* 's ["Sexism, misogyny and online attacks: It’s a horrible time to consider yourself a ‘gamer’"](http://business.financialpost.com/2014/08/28/sexism-misogyny-and-online-attacks-its-a-horrible-time-to-consider-yourself-a-gamer/?__lsa=7e5a-1d2d)
		7. **Arthur Chu** for *The Daily Beast* 's ["It's Dangerous to Go Alone: Why Are Gamers So Angry?"](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/08/28/it-s-dangerous-to-go-alone-why-are-gamers-so-angry.html)
		8. Dan Golding's ["The End of Gamers"](http://dangolding.tumblr.com/post/95985875943/the-end-of-gamers)
	These enter Gamergate's tale of collusion as the "Gamers Are Dead" articles (see [IRC logs](http://puu.sh/boAEC/f072f259b6.txt) @ Aug 28 21.40.25), claiming that they were meant to oppress gamers.
	(Side note: Actually, Dan Golding's blog post was released before Leigh Alexander's article, but it was quickly thrown together with the other articles.)
	- The situation is so dire, that even the **International Games Developer Association** [releases an official statement](http://www.igda.org/news/190128/IGDA-Board-of-Directors-Statement-on-Harassment.htm).
		Gamergate points out that the statement does not condemn Gamergate. At this time the hashtag has only existed for one day.
- August 29: **The Fine Young Capitalists** [backpedal on their claims](https://archive.ph/ovFmu) that **Zoe Quinn** doxxed or hacked them.
- August 30:
	- **Internet Aristocrat** creates a third video \[The video is no longer available, see below\].
	- Alexander Macris, founder of ***The Escapist***, [comes out in favor of proto-Gamergate](http://www.escapistmagazine.com/forums/read/18.858347-Zoe-Quinn-and-the-surrounding-controversy?page=375#21330098) in the neverending forum thread against **Zoe Quinn**. In a response to **Anita Sarkeesian**, he reposts [an old "call to arms" on Twitter](https://archive.ph/kyPQI).
- August 31:
	- MRA activist **Mike Cernovich**, one of Gamergate's "e-celebs", quickly nicknamed "Based Lawyer", joins the mob, grandstanding by [taunting](https://archive.ph/8Yoxu) **Anita Sarkeesian** after the attacks on her.
	- Gamergate launches its [Operation "Disrespectful Nod"](http://pastebin.com/JM9pNbCc), creating email campaigns to cut off ad revenue from publications critical of Gamergate. It is named "Disrespectful Nod" as a means to mock Marc Threadingham, who had sent **Zoe Quinn** a message of support in the early days of the harassment sent to Quinn. Gamergaters turned him into a meme and labeled him a [white knight](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/White_knight "White knight").

### September 2014

Frank gets targeted by Gamergate anyway.
	- Breitbart.com writer **[Milo Yiannopoulos](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Milo_Yiannopoulos "Milo Yiannopoulos")** [joins the mob](https://archive.ph/b8OOj), possibly recruited by the Internet Aristocrat. Milo publishes [a summary of the Gamergate narrative thus far](https://archive.ph/DcWIa).

- September 2: **#NotYourShield** is starting up, [planned on /v/](https://archive.moe/v/thread/261343810/#261347271) as a ["special jamming op", in order to expose "SJW hypocrisy"](https://archive.ph/jFjHq). (The invention of the hashtag is most often [attributed to **Jason "j\_millerworks" Miller**](https://archive.ph/Z09RR)). Its first use is by [Twitter user and /pol/ participant Ninouh90](https://archive.ph/lnN3p)
	(Side note 1: The IRC members discussed how non-minority members should join #NotYourShield in order to boost it \[see [IRC logs](http://puu.sh/boAEC/f072f259b6.txt) @ Sep 03 00.04.52\].)
	(Side note 2: **Jay Allen**, a.k.a. @a\_man\_in\_black, would later point out that [many accounts in #NotYourShield were sockpuppets](https://web.archive.org/web/20170222000637/https://storify.com/a_man_in_black/gamergate-1) from an earlier /pol/ campaign, "Operation Lollipop", that [had been covered in "Clutch" magazine](http://www.clutchmagonline.com/2014/06/yourslipisshowing-busts-twitter-users-pretended-feminists-attack-black-women/) )

In order to protect its image the group aims to control the harassment of Frank \[See [IRC log](http://puu.sh/boAEC/f072f259b6.txt) @ Sep 03 22.03.43\]. But quickly admits that it can't do anything about it: "its too big now".
	- [*The Guardian* calls out Gamergate](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/sep/03/gamergate-corruption-games-anita-sarkeesian-zoe-quinn), being one of the first major newspapers to do so.

	- **Zoe Quinn** [publishes the data they gathered on the various 4chan/8chan boards and IRC](https://web.archive.org/web/20180517172651/https://storify.com/strictmachine/gameovergate), which later on leads to the release of the entire [IRC logs](http://puu.sh/boAEC/f072f259b6.txt) of #BurgersAndFries by 4chan mods. The IRC is abandoned on the same day; a new IRC is created elsewhere.

Their proposal mocks and directly quotes both [**Anita Sarkeesian**](http://www.theverge.com/2014/9/13/6145169/anita-sarkeesian-shares-the-most-radical-thing-you-can-do-to-support) and her collaborator [**Jonathan McIntosh**](https://twitter.com/radicalbytes/status/550503527668129792), even seeing fit to twist Sarkeesian's statement to their own goals. A fun fact: they allow gender-based violence as submissions.
- January 22: [Supporters of the petition](https://archive.ph/zko1Z) against **Adam Baldwin** get doxxed, as Gamergate is [furious about the move](http://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/2t5fce/antiggers_trying_to_go_after_adam_baldwin_for_his/).

- February 11: NBC broadcasts [*Law & Order: SVU* "Intimidation Game"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6I1VQTkrCU), an episode inspired by Gamergate and the harassment of its victims. While [the reactions](http://www.polygon.com/2015/2/12/8022483/gamergate-law-order-review) [are mixed](http://www.ew.com/article/2015/02/11/law-order-svus-take-online-harassment-uncomfortably-accurate), yet Gamergate claims that the end of the show, depicting the retirement of a harassed, kidnapped, and gang-raped game developer from the gaming industry, [is a victory for the mob](http://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/2vm2n5/even_in_their_fanfiction_we_end_up_winning/).

	- **Milo Yiannopoulos** declares in an article titled "The Wacky World of Wu: The Tortured History of GamerGate’s Self-Styled Feminist Martyr" that "GamerGate is not a 'transphobic' mob, as you may have been misled to believe."

		(Side note: The article is not linked here as its wingnuttery is off the charts.)
	- **Bob "MovieBob" Chipman** [announces he has been fired](http://moviebob.blogspot.com/2015/02/all-good-things.html) from ***The Escapist***; Gamergate claims this is because on October 12, 2014, [he got into an argument on Twitter where he was not sympathetic to a Gamergate supporter having been harassed](https://twitter.com/the_moviebob/status/521499888602083328).

In talking with *The Daily Dot*, Carrera continues to attack Sarkeesian and **Brianna Wu** because they were only threatened with rape whereas the pornographic actress was actually raped, and goes on to accuse Sarkeesian and Wu of being [professional victims](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Professional_victim "Professional victim").

Rankowski had actually crashed his car, but ad-libbed the video where he threatened **Brianna Wu**. Rankowski claims to be suffering from harassment by Gamergaters, while Wu [plans on taking him to court](http://jezebel.com/man-who-terrorized-brianna-wu-for-months-says-he-was-ju-1687689719) as he was one of the reasons her company pulled out of the gaming convention PAX East.

### March 2015

Because he references #NotYourShield in the bit, Gamergate claims he's racist and sexist for doing so and starts #SayItToMyFaceTim as a hashtag, referencing yet another ancient meme.
		(Side note: The full bit can be viewed [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoJtfRH1rlQ))
- March 7:
	- Gamergate [targets](http://imgur.com/a/CT7mL) a **Google** employee under the impression that he was responsible for the deletion of a tweet that unintentionally supported Gamergate, and was followed by an immediate retraction and apology that condemned Gamergate two days earlier.

When he realizes he is being noticed by critics of Gamergate, he claims he is "neutral" on the situation. Multiple tweets promoting Gamergate are found in his timeline and it is discovered that [his account was previously suspended](https://archive.ph/Agjho) for harassing **Jonathan McIntosh**, the co-writer of *Feminist Frequency*.

It was originally created in 2012 [as a video game lobbying group](http://www.tomsguide.com/us/SOPA-PIPA-League-For-Gamers-REd-5-Studios-ESA,news-13937.html) in response to the Entertainment Software Association's support of the [Stop Online Piracy Act](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Stop_Online_Piracy_Act "Stop Online Piracy Act").

"Vordrak") [proposes a crowdfunding campaign to help him develop a Twitter bot that spams Twitter's abuse report system and sends messages to people who have already blocked others](http://matthewhopkinsnews.com/?p=1153). Needless to say, this violates Twitter's terms of service and various moral lines. He later [backpedals](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/04/09/1376702/-Self-Appointed-Witchfinder-Attempts-to-Automate-Twitter-Witch-Hunts?showAll=yes) and says it was a parody.
- March 9: Blogger Zennistrad [posts about how social scientists had come forward to say that Gamergate was negatively affecting academia's views on studying video games](http://zennistrad.tumblr.com/post/113151511988/gamergate-is-killing-video-games) and that Gamergate was pleased with the result. One [claimed that Gamergate set back the view of video games decades](http://np.reddit.com/r/GamerGhazi/comments/2yeh1f/in_answer_to_where_are_the_scientists_who_study/) and the other, who goes by @8BitBecca, tried to archive video games (as with film archiving) and discovered that she would have likely been denied funding for her project had Gamergate happened the year before. Gamergate responds by doing their best to dox and harass her, [leading her to shut down her social media](http://np.reddit.com/r/GamerGhazi/comments/2yrhss/wanted_to_say_thanks/).
- March 11: **Sarah Nyberg** [writes about her experiences with Gamergate](http://www.ravishly.com/2015/03/02/sarah-nyberg-hate-movement-gaming-threats-abuse-bullying) for *Ravishly* for the first time with her name rather than as @srhbutts.

- March 12: **Davis Aurini** and **Jordan Owen** [announce they have come to an agreement and will continue to work together on *The Sarkeesian Effect*](http://wehuntedthemammoth.com/2015/03/13/sarkeesian-effect-makeup-jordan-owen-and-davis-aurini-are-reunited-and-it-feels-so-weird/).
- March 13: Chris Mancil, Director of Digital Communications for EA, writes that on February 15, after he had retweeted a comment made by **Milo Yiannopoulos**, [he suffered a loss of nearly 2500 followers on Twitter](https://archive.ph/Dkwcs). He attributes this to the Good Game Auto Blocker, calling his alleged inclusion on the list a "Scarlet Letter" and the act of the blocker creating a "tribal apartheid"; he also makes allusions to Israel and Palestine. He is unaware that the third-party tool that allows the Good Game Auto Blocker to work does not work on Twitter accounts the user intentionally follows, which means 2500 people manually unfollowed him.
- March 17: **Twitter** announces new rules that prohibit harassment by sending "large numbers of unsolicited @replies or mentions"; **Randi Harper** [deduces this as the issues concerning sea-lioning](http://blog.randi.io/2015/03/17/sealions-beware-a-look-at-the-twitter-rules/).
- March 18: **James Desborough** [announces his intent to sue](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/03/18/1371718/--Gamergate-Harasser-Threatens-to-Sue-Randi-Harper-Unless-She-Removes-Him-from-Anti-GG-Block-List) **Randi Harper** over his inclusion in the list of users on Good Game Auto Blocker unless he is removed.
- March 20: [*Ars Technica* interviews](http://arstechnica.com/business/2015/03/20/were-a-common-carrier-8chans-founder-on-the-link-between-doxing-net-freedom/) **Fredrick "Hotwheels" Brennan** about owning 8chan. The interview is heavily panned by Gamergate's victims and critics as being a massive puff piece, and [it is revealed that *Ars Technica* edited old articles on 8chan to be more sympathetic, several more hard-hitting questions were cut out of the final article, and *Ars* only agreed to interview him so long as previous dox of a reporter was removed from 8chan](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/03/24/1372796/-Ars-Technica-Readers-Meet-the-Real-Hotwheels). Days later, *Ars Technica* [would publish their interview with](http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/03/25/that-life-is-over-zoe-quinn-looks-beyond-gamergate/) **Zoe Quinn** and **Alex Lifschitz**, who both expressed displeasure with Brennan's interview as well as the fact it is hyperlinked to theirs. Interviewer Sam Machkovech [is doxxed by /baphomet/ soon after](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/03/26/1373353/-Ars-Technica-Double-Crossed-by-Baphomet-Brennan-s-Personal-Army) for not being as lenient as he could have been when discussing them.
- March 22: For some inexplicable reason, **[Richard Dawkins](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Richard_Dawkins "Richard Dawkins")** [is drawn into Gamergate](http://np.reddit.com/r/GamerGhazi/comments/2zwfnc/dawkins_edges_ever_closer_to_going_full_gator/) because he discovers his listing on "The Block Bot" (different from **Randi Harper** 's Good Game Auto Blocker) through *Breitbart* and the participation of many Gators to tell him Gamergate is about "ethics in video game journalism". **Mark Kern** reaches out to him. Dawkins demands a follower apologizes to **[Carl "Sargon of Akkad" Benjamin](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Sargon_of_Akkad "Sargon of Akkad")**. Dawkins ultimately decides to remain "ignorant" of what Gamergate really is, but remains indignant over alleged libel.
- March 23: **Intel** [tweets support](https://twitter.com/intel/status/580051886088314882) of **GaymerX**; Gamergate gets upset.
- March 24:
	- The moderator of **8chan** 's /gamergate/ board reveals he had been doxxed by **Ethan "TheRalphRetort" Ralph** and ceases supporting the mob after the board is hacked. 8chan's Gamergater contingent moves back to the original board /gg/.
	- Jeremiah True, a student at Reed College who has been in the press for having been banned from his class over disruptive discussions of [rape culture](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Rape_culture "Rape culture"), [for some inexplicable reason aligns himself with Gamergate](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/03/24/rape-culture-troll-threatens-reed-college.html) when he calls out **Anita Sarkeesian** in his 16-page essay on why he should be allowed back in the class. [Not even](http://reason.com/blog/2015/03/19/male-students-non-pc-views-on-rape-stati) [Reason.com](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Reason_\(magazine\) "Reason (magazine)") [can make heads or tails](http://reason.com/blog/2015/03/24/interview-reed-college-provocateur-expla) of this guy's antics.
	- *Salon* notices **Milo Yiannopoulos** ' and others' attempts to [dump video games for the culture war over progressivism in comic books](http://www.salon.com/2015/03/24/the_new_gamergate_angry_white_men_are_trying_to_shut_down_diverse_comics/) with concerns over the titles *Thor* (now a woman), *Captain America* (now a black man), *Ultimate Spider-Man* (now a black/Latino biracial boy), *Ms. Marvel* (now a Pakistani-American Muslim girl), and *Batgirl* (because a variant cover got pulled due to implications of rape).
- March 26: **Brianna Wu** [reports that a Gamergate supporter tried to verbally hijack a panel she was participating in at Youngstown State University](https://twitter.com/Spacekatgal/status/581283499849736192). Police barred him from reentering the room and investigated the bag he left behind as Wu has been sent threats concerning explosives in the past.
- March 28: **Mark Kern** 's video gamer's lobby turned consumer advocacy group League For Gamers [announces](https://twitter.com/League4Gamers/status/581924962233131008) that they have added a tool to their website that allows people to see if they're blocked by either **Randi Harper** 's Good Game Auto Blocker or the [Atheism Plus](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Atheism_Plus "Atheism Plus") Block Bot. What does this have to do with video game consumers' advocacy? Why is there so much crossover between a block list that sees if someone follows multiple Gamergate figureheads and [a block list curated to prevent interaction with assholish people in the atheist and skeptic communities](http://freethoughtblogs.com/almostdiamonds/2013/09/21/questions-on-a-block-bot/)? How many licks does it take to get to the Tootsie Roll center of a Tootsie Pop? The world may never know.
- March 29: [A transphobic joke is discovered in Obsidian's *Pillars of Eternity*](http://www.themarysue.com/pillars-of-eternity-transphobia/), having been submitted by one of the game's backers on Kickstarter. A member of the Obsidian development team is reached and agrees that the content should not have been added and the concern is amicably resolved. Unless you're Gamergate. The transgender woman who brought the content to light is harassed for having dared to say anything.

Draiman considered Noah's older tweets anti-Semitic, and sought out support from his Gamergate followers to take a stand against anti-Semitism. Instead, he was met with a flood of anti-Semitic jokes, and ended up blocking more than 250 followers as a result.
	- The "IMO: Crash Network Override" article on ***TechRaptor*** is discovered by **Izzy Galvez**, **Zoe Quinn**, and **Alex Lifschitz**.

Another observer discovers that [it the image is the first result in Google](https://twitter.com/TedWright/status/583739732309381120) for "thirty pieces of silver", the price [Judas Iscariot](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Judas_Iscariot "Judas Iscariot") was paid to betray [Jesus](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Jesus "Jesus") as written in the [Gospel of Matthew](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Gospel_of_Matthew "Gospel of Matthew").

The following week, [**George R. R. Martin**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_R._R._Martin "wp:George R. R. Martin") [opines](http://grrm.livejournal.com/417125.html) that "the Sad Puppies \[and Beale\] have broken the Hugo Awards" beyond redemption; he also [writes](http://grrm.livejournal.com/418285.html) how he fears the groups "are beyond the pale, raging and ranting about SJWs and cliques and secret conspiracies."
- April 6: For some reason **/r/KotakuInAction** decides Reddit's interim CEO [Ellen Pao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellen_Pao "wp:Ellen Pao") has to do with their goals of "ethics in video game journalism" after all of the news concerning her pro-diversity hiring practices and [her loss in her lawsuit against former employer Kleiner Perkins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pao_v._Kleiner_Perkins "wp:Pao v. Kleiner Perkins") goes around. For this reason, they decide to organize a boycott of buying Reddit Gold memberships for themselves or others. [The original post and several subsequent posts by the proposer are gilded in response](http://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/31n4si/proposal_stop_buying_reddit_gold_until_ellen_pao/). Later, /r/EllenPaoInAction is formed by this set.
- April 12: **Anita Sarkeesian** goes to a board game parlor in Columbus, Ohio, and later discovers that a collaborator of **[TheAmazingAtheist](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/TheAmazingAtheist "TheAmazingAtheist")** known as Ben [took her photograph without her permission and posted it](https://twitter.com/femfreq/status/587450267307638784). Gamergate comes out to support Ben, for obvious reasons.
- April 14: **Running With Scissors** ' [*Postal 2*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postal_2 "wp:Postal 2") receives downloadable content 12 years after its initial release. **Milo Yiannopoulos** [has been included, with his blessing](http://www.gamepolitics.com/2015/04/21/postal-2-dlc-includes-breitbartcom-columnist-milo-yiannopoulos#.VTljaJNgvm5) as an Easter Egg that turns all NPCs into him, and he can of course be killed.
- April 15: **Zoe Quinn** [speaks at a congressional briefing on cyberstalking](http://www.polygon.com/2015/4/15/8420237/depression-quest-creator-speaks-at-congressional-briefing-on). The panel decides to start the #StopWebH8 hashtag to begin discussion on the dangers of cyberstalking and harassment over the Internet. Gamergate supporters disrupt it in their usual ways.
- April 17: [It is discovered](http://www.themarysue.com/calgary-expo-gamergate-evicted/) that contributors to ***A Voice For Men*** 's official feMRA podcast **Honey Badger Radio** had operated a vendor's booth at the Calgary Comic & Entertainment Expo, selling Gamergate posters, and had disrupted a panel on women in comics the night before. The group, who entered under the false name "Honey Badger Brigade", are asked to leave the convention center and not participate in future events. It is also discovered that they had crowdfunded their entrance fees into the event for the sole purpose of disrupting it. The group appeals to Gamergate with cries of censorship and misogyny ([because they are women](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Friend_argument "Friend argument") \[well two of them are\]) and #ExpoGate is born. The group begins to crowdfund a "legal fund" to sue Calgary Expo for damages.
- April 21: The documentary *GameLoading: Rise of the Indies* is released on Steam. [Gamergate goes after it](http://np.reddit.com/r/GamerGhazi/comments/33e0q5/the_documentary_gameloading_rise_of_the_indies/) when they learn **Zoe Quinn** was interviewed for it.
- April 24: **Brianna Wu** speaks at RavenCon in Richmond, Virginia, and **Ethan "TheRalphRetort" Ralph** states his intention to attend and "interview" her. [RavenCon announces they will step up security](http://file770.com/?p=22103) in response to his essential threat. He shows up anyway at her panel to raise shit and be kicked out. Wu and event security fulfill his wish. Gamergate does things in response, as usual.
- April 25: Denver Comic Con [states the Gamergate logo falls under its "no hateful symbols" rule](https://twitter.com/srhbutts/status/592137674401525760) when asked on Twitter. They later [reverse that position](https://archive.ph/nHvIj) after Gamergaters get angry.
- April 28: *Boston Magazine* publishes ["Game of Fear"](http://www.bostonmagazine.com/news/article/2015/04/28/gamergate/), describing the genesis of Gamergate. It features interviews with **Zoe Quinn** and **Eron Gjoni**, among others, with both telling the events that led up to Gjoni's post and the initial wave of harassment against Quinn. As a result of the article, Michael Dorn of *[Star Trek](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Star_Trek "Star Trek")* fame comes out in support of Quinn.
- April 29: Someone in Gamergate decides that their boycott should extend to *[The New York Times](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times "The New York Times")* due to its negative coverage of the mob.
- April 30: **S. Rachel Martin** updates her blog post "GamerGate Launched in My Apartment, and, Internet, I’m Sorry. (Not that sorry.)" in response to the *Boston Magazine* story to say, "I regret what I’ve done and left undone contributing to attacks on those affected by the events following the publication of \[The Zoe Post\]. I maintain my hopes that women in games and all fields are able to keep doing what they love **and that the actions against them STOP**." (emphasis hers).

### May 2015

- May 1: A group of D.C. area Gamergaters, apparently organized by **Milo Yiannopoulos** and **Christina Hoff Sommers**, go to a local restaurant for what is dubbed #GGinDC; also in attendance is **Lizzy "lizzyf620" Finnegan**. **Arthur Chu** contacts the bar on Twitter, warning it that Gamergate is a hate mob and is organizing there, [leading to predictable indignation](http://np.reddit.com/r/GamerGhazi/comments/34l9dn/suddenly_gamergate_decides_mass_email_campaigns/). Sometime after this, [a bomb threat is called into the bar](http://kotaku.com/gamergate-meetup-evacuated-after-apparent-threat-1701761645), leading to an evacuation, although the DC police do not confirm anything to *Kotaku* reporters. Gamergaters predictably blame SJWs/feminists without evidence, while **Slade "RogueStar" Villena** [decides to implicate Chu](https://twitter.com/srhbutts/status/594426769479860224). Meanwhile, **Mark Kern** [makes a tasteless joke](https://twitter.com/srhbutts/status/594393299487600640) about " [professional victimhood](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Professional_victim "Professional victim") ".
	(Side note: Months later, Arthur Chu [remarks that he had heard the threat to this meet up was planned on **8chan**](https://twitter.com/arthur_affect/status/632636987367751680).)
- May 2: The German antinazi website *Netz Gegen Nazis* (Internet against Nazis) [publishes an article](http://www.netz-gegen-nazis.de/artikel/strategien-und-typologisierung-von-hate-groups-10309) which refers to gamergate as an example of a far-right hate group. To this very day the site takes interest in publicizing pieces where German people express interest to fight against the harassment present in gaming culture.
- May 4:
	- [Joss Whedon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joss_Whedon "wp:Joss Whedon") closes his Twitter account after the new *Avengers* movie opens in theaters. Gamergaters believe it is because he was "bullied" off Twitter by feminists who criticized the portrayal of the character Black Widow. Whedon attempts to set the record straight in a *BuzzFeed* interview [by saying he left Twitter to focus on his writing](http://www.buzzfeed.com/adambvary/joss-whedon-on-leaving-twitter#.lkKaK3N1v). He adds that blaming "militant feminists" is "horseshit". The Gamergaters on Reddit [go full tinfoil hat](http://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/3519ji/whedon_claims_on_buzzfeed_that_militant_feminists/).
	- Society of Professional Journalists regional director **Michael Koretzky** [gives Gamergate the time of day](http://journoterrorist.com/2015/05/04/gamergate/) after their disruption of the #SPJEthicsWeek hashtag, apparently believing in their claims about being about "ethics in video game journalism". Gamergate seemingly ignores his own issues with [ethics in journalism](http://journoterrorist.com/about/) and [his background](http://www.spjflorida.com/2009/11/2010-chapter-election-update-a-note-from-darcie-lunsford). He plans to hold a debate for both sides [dubbed "AirPlay"](http://journoterrorist.com/airplay/).
- May 8: After [soliciting advice](http://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/34ucqe/eron_here_update_on_my_appeal_and_a_request_for/) from **/r/KotakuInAction** when his previous pro-bono attorney went missing, **Eron Gjoni** has determined that he will appeal the restraining order placed against him. Unfortunately for him, $10,000 is required to retain the necessary legal counsel. A [further appeal is made](http://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/35bqqk/eron_here_found_a_lawyer_freedom_of_speech_is/) to **/r/KotakuInAction** for funding.
- May 11:
	- **Michael Koretzky** [announces his committee for choosing representatives for the "AirPlay" debate](http://journoterrorist.com/airplay4/), currently scheduled for August 15, 2015. The committee members are **Allum Bokhari**, a *Breitbart* contributor and Gamergate supporter; **Dave Rickey**, a game designer who supports Gamergate; "John Smith", a 19-year-old 4channer (admin of a rival site 38chan) who describes the "SJW Wars" in his bio; and **William Usher**, the man responsible for leaking the GameJournoPros list. Koretzky apparently reached out to a woman to be on the committee, but she unsurprisingly declined the offer. **Jay Allen** [heavily critiques](https://twitter.com/a_man_in_black/status/597968379304026112) Koretzky's ethics, saying that journalists are supposed to minimize harm. This leads to Usher asking him if he wants to be on the panel and [revealing his shortlist](https://twitter.com/WilliamUsherGB/status/597979898683109377). Allen [points out](https://twitter.com/a_man_in_black/status/597980263029702656) that the people on the "anti-Gamergate" list wouldn't want to be within 300 miles of a Gator let alone the same room, and the "neutrals"— **Allistair Pinsof**, **Erik Kain** (wrote several blog posts about the mob for *Forbes*), **Derek Smart** (a game dev known for causing one of the largest flame wars in [Usenet](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Usenet "Usenet") history), and **Alexander Macris** (*The Escapist*)—all lean in Gamergate's favor.
	- Gamergate [loses the support of Japanese game developers Roninworks](https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/35jtgk/japanese_game_developers_leave_gg_after_being/) due to harassment by **Slade "RogueStar" Villena** and **Margaret "@\_icze4r" Gel**, a member of the so-called "Gamergate Harassment Patrol".
- May 12: **Brianna Wu** 's [personal cellphone number is posted](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/05/13/1384440/-Brianna-Wu-s-CC-Defrauded-Cell-Phone-Number-posted-on-Baphomet) to 8chan's /baphomet/, /r/KotakuInAction, Twitter, and Japanese image board 2chan, resulting in several threatening phone calls. Additionally, she finds that several hundred dollars of fraudulent purchases were made with her credit card on the Steam video game platform; **Randi Harper** also reports having a fraudulent purchase made with one of her credit cards through Steam.
- May 13: Gamergate gains the support of **Denis Dyack**, another video game developer [with a sordid past in the industry and an axe to grind for ***Kotaku***](http://np.reddit.com/r/GamerGhazi/comments/35usbi/gamergate_is_about_to_count_another_dev_in_its/).
- May 15: The Gamergaters at **/r/KotakuInAction** [grasp at the biggest straw ever by accusing that](http://np.reddit.com/r/GamerGhazi/comments/3654gs/gamergate_believes_ghazi_is_named_after_the_death/) **/r/GamerGhazi** "is named after an event where a gamer was murdered by terrorists. The real kind." Somehow instead of associating their name with the conservative conspiracy theories that came about as a result of the [2012 Benghazi attack](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/2012_Benghazi_attack "2012 Benghazi attack"), they chose to associate it with [Sean Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Smith_\(diplomat\) "wp:Sean Smith (diplomat)"), an American diplomat killed in the attack who just happened to be a well-known player of *Eve Online* and a Goon at *Something Awful*.
- May 16: **Michael Koretzky** 's AirPlay panelists are chosen, and what a great crop of people: **Milo Yiannopoulos**, **Brad Wardell**, **Cathy Young** of *Reason*, **Christina Hoff Sommers**, **Oliver Campbell**, illustrator Mark Ceb, **William Usher**, and indie game dev Jennifer Dawe. Still no word on "neutrals" or "anti-Gamergate" representatives, obviously.
- May 18: **Eron Gjoni** is [banned from all of Reddit](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/05/19/1385737/-Eron-Gjoni-Banned-from-Reddit-for-Fundraising-in-Violation-of-Reddit-ToS), as he has violated the site's self-promotion rules in posting links to his donation fund to fight against the restraining order. After furore from Gamergaters, Gjoni is able to get the ban overturned. Throughout the ordeal, Gjoni has been given $15k, all for the sole purpose of being allowed to harass **Zoe Quinn**, again; meanwhile, his personal Patreon account earns him less than $50 a month.
- May 20: **Brianna Wu** [releases a threatening phone call she received](http://www.themarysue.com/will-prosecutors-act-on-gamergate-death-threat/) after her phone number was doxxed, mentioning Ron O'Brien, the prosecuting attorney for Franklin County, Ohio, in her op-ed for *The Mary Sue* as someone who could solve her problem with the threatening calls from Columbus, Ohio. However, there was a mix-up with how the case was handled by Wu's staff, as she later clarified in talking to the [*Columbus Biz Insider*](http://www.bizjournals.com/columbus/blog/2015/05/gamergate-in-columbus-threat-reports-initially.html?ana=twt); her information had been sent to the Columbus City Attorney's office rather than the Franklin County Attorney's office, and she apologized for the mix-up from her end, and later had a conversation with O'Brien on the matter. However, *Breitbart London* still published an article saying she had lied about the situation without bothering to include any of the actual facts while citing *Columbus Biz Insider* in the hitpiece.
- May 24: **Charles C. Johnson**, an extremely right wing "journalist" \[Gawker.com: [archive.ph](http://archive.ph/http://gawker.com/which-of-these-disgusting-chuck-johnson-rumors-are-true-1669433099), [web.archive.org](http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://gawker.com/which-of-these-disgusting-chuck-johnson-rumors-are-true-1669433099) who was so thoroughly hated by his college classmates that they spread a rumor that he took a shit on the floor in their dormitory\], [is banned from Twitter](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2015/05/26/charles-johnson-one-of-the-internets-most-infamous-trolls-has-finally-been-banned-from-twitter/) after he threatens Ferguson and Baltimore activist DeRay McKesson. This makes it the sixth time he's been banned from the service. Because of his shining record of journalistic excellence ([and at one point supporting Gamergate](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:iFqUCWHVhQgJ:https://twitter.com/chuckcjohnson/status/577009161323421696+&cd=3&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us)), [Gamergate figureheads try to rally the group behind him](https://twitter.com/srhbutts/status/603335531225710592).

### June 2015

- June 1: Gamergate rallies behind novelist [Anne Rice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Rice "wp:Anne Rice") and the blog *Stop the Goodreads Bullies* after *STGRB* [posts](http://www.stopthegrbullies.com/2015/06/01/randi-harpers-bully-review/) **Randi Harper** 's Amazon.com review where she calls out Vivek Wadhwa, a dispute that predates Gamergate. The [followup post on *STGRB*](http://www.stopthegrbullies.com/2015/06/02/randi-harper-fights-amazons-removal-of-her-bully-review/) is full of Gamergate-related screenshots and tweets. Harper [reports receiving threatening emails](https://twitter.com/randileeharper/status/605650176976371715) from Anne Rice fans dogpiling her on top of Gamergaters.
- June 3-6: The Canadian Game Studies Association's 2015 conference has extensive efforts put in place to prevent Gamergate from disrupting online discussion of the event, as has happened over and over in the past. Attendee **Natalie Zina (Zed) Walschots** [who expressed displeasure with how events unfolded](http://www.vocativ.com/tech/internet/gamergate-newest-nemesis-phd-student-natalie-zed/) decides to come up with the joke hashtag #DeathEaters, referencing the *[Harry Potter](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Harry_Potter "Harry Potter")* novels, to allow attendees to discuss a Gamergate panel and Gamergate in general. This works until the final day when one attendee uses "Gamergate" in a tweet, and is public for 10 minutes until it is taken down. By June 6, Walschots is Gamergate's newest target, as they tracked down the use of #DeathEaters to her, and they begin to assail her university to disqualify her planned PhD on Gamergate under the usual baseless conjecture.
- June 9: The **Australian Communications and Media Authority** [announces its findings](http://www.acma.gov.au/theACMA/ACMAi/Investigation-reports/Television-investigations/2015-television-investigations) with regards to complaints about ABC's *7:30* news feature on Gamergate. There were no breaches of ethics on behalf of the broadcaster, throwing out the complaints of a lack of due impartiality and a lack of diversity of perspectives. The ACMA specifically stated, "Impartiality does not require that every perspective receives equal time, or that every facet of every issue is presented," and also pointed out the program said other facets existed, and the production team went above and beyond in their attempts to find someone "pro-Gamergate" to speak with and found no one.
- June 10: Reddit announces the banning of several subreddits that were used for harassment only. While /r/TumblrInAction and /r/KotakuInAction are unscathed, somehow the shuttering of /r/FatPeopleHate brings out [the usual Gamergate related crowd](https://twitter.com/srhbutts/status/608813135856730112).
- June 11: Reddit competitor/clone ***Voat*** begins to buckle under the increased server strain as a result of the exodus from Reddit, with [the new user base trying to rally for Bitcoin payment to help](http://gizmodo.com/fat-hating-redditors-flee-to-voat-overload-servers-de-1710690125). Voat is now favored by Gamergaters, pedophiles, and neo-Nazis for some reason.
- June 12: Gamergate decides to rally behind [Hulk Hogan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulk_Hogan "wp:Hulk Hogan") because [of his pending lawsuit against Gawker Media for having hosted his sex tape](http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/media/2015/06/8570075/gawker-fight-its-life-hulk-hogan-sex-tape-suit). This again has nothing to do with ethics in video game journalism but simply Gamergate's irrational hatred of *Kotaku*.
- June 16: A [memorandum (page 18)](https://www.spj.org/pdf/boardmeeting/spj-exec-meeting-packet-2015-06-27.pdf) from the Society of Professional Journalists' president Dana Neuts discusses #SPJEthicsWeek and Gamergate's disruption of the hashtag, and the statement that they chose no to engage with the Gamergaters. The memo also brings up the SPJ's decision to ban **Michael Koretzky** from using the SPJ logo for his AirPlay website, where a nearly unanimous vote (one member voted in favor of use, and that member was not Koretzky) decided to keep the ban in place.
- June 17:
	- The **Honey Badger Brigade** [finally announces they've hired legal counsel](http://imgur.com/XjDjgsp) for their totally legitimate case against the Calgary Comic & Entertainment Expo: unlicensed Canadian lawyer [Harry Kopyto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kopyto "wp:Harry Kopyto") who was permanently disbarred in 1989 for overbilling Legal Aid.
	- Gamergaters claim that "SWJs" raged (because a few hundred people going "ugh" is raging, now) against the use of the tagline "Mechanical Apartheid" in the new *Deus Ex: Mankind Divided* promo. Someone, presumably the person whom made the tagline, makes vague complaints about "SJWs" on Reddit and provides no evidence for anything he says. This spurs **Mark Kern** [to announce he's now a supporter of Gamergate](https://twitter.com/Grummz/status/611227830899208192). Mark's support surprises no one except Gamergaters.
	- Gamergaters get angry at **Anita Sarkeesian** for [criticizing their waifu](https://twitter.com/femfreq/status/611229178596233218/) on the E3 guest badge.
	- [Someone at 8chan thinks its a smart idea to stalk](http://np.reddit.com/r/GamerGhazi/comments/3a90d5/actually_its_about_ethics_in_stalking_jonathan/) **Jonathan McIntosh** at E3 and then mock him for having an expensive backpack. [Turns out it's not even his](https://twitter.com/radicalbytes/status/611433602069303296).
	- A dispute between ***TechRaptor*** and rival pro-Gamergate video game site *GamesNosh* [over the latter copying the former's "ethics" policy](http://techraptor.net/content/gamesnosh-ethics-policies-and-patreons) reveals that *TechRaptor* staff punished and censored a staff writer [who (rightfully) deduced Gamergate was dead (when it comes to "ethics in video game journalism") and had turned into an SJW witch hunt (it was like that from the start)](https://twitter.com/SDComps/status/611003994236932096) when Gamergaters generally didn't give a shit about this turn of events.
- June 18: [Multiple people report seeing posters](http://www.zenofdesign.com/fem-freak/) featuring attacks on **Anita Sarkeesian**, **Jonathan McIntosh**, ***Kotaku*** with "Gamergate" repeatedly printed on them outside the Los Angeles Convention Center as E3 is underway. This is more proof that Gamergate (despite [its claim](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Bullshit "Bullshit") that it has nothing with feminists) has all to do with anti-feminism, with "Gamergate" as an imprinted watermark for Anita Sarkeesian's posters [\[1\]](http://www.zenofdesign.com/fem-freak/). They also twist famous memes such as the " [All Your Base Are Belong To Us](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/all-your-base-are-belong-to-us) " into the anti-Sarkeesian poster reads "All your tropes are belong to us". A so-called "right-wing graffiti artist collective" that *apparently* has no ties to Gamergate [is fingered as responsible](http://np.reddit.com/r/GamerGhazi/comments/3ajikl/right_wing_graffiti_artist_collective_probably/).
- June 19: ***Voat*** announces their German hosting service, Host Europe, [has shut down their servers due to "political incorrect" content](https://voat.co/v/announcements/comments/146757), and you should send donations. Their website goes down for several days.
- June 21: The week's *Last Week Tonight with John Oliver* [focuses on Internet harassment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuNIwYsz7PI). Clips of **Anita Sarkeesian** and **Brianna Wu** speaking on *Nightline* are used, before Oliver discusses the issues regarding the ineptitude of the legal system with regards to the Internet as well as revenge porn, with the latter being the main focus. Despite **never mentioning Gamergate once** and only focusing on Sarkeesian and Wu for about 17 seconds, [threads on /r/KotakuInAction spring up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYpnpYDQdbk) trying to either spin Oliver's words in their favor or declaring they are cancelling their HBO subscriptions.
- June 22: Host Europe [releases a statement](https://archive.ph/TqQDn) regarding their shutdown of ***Voat*** 's server, although they do not mention Voat by name. They deny that the server shutdown was over "politically incorrect content", and instead state that they draw the line when laws are broken and when they have a moral obligation for the safety of others. They described Voat as such: "The site in questions was publicizing incitement of people, as well as abusive, insulting and youth-endangering content." Or in German as the English is a bit wonky, "Im angesprochenen Forum wurden offensichtlich volksverhetzende, beleidigende, bloßstellende und jugendgefährdende Inhalte zur Verfügung gestellt, von denen wir uns explizit distanzieren möchten." Basically, everything /r/FatPeopleHate and /r/Jailbait were shut down for.
- June 23:
	- Gamergate talking head **MundaneMatt** decides his prospective audience isn't big enough and branches out into the lucrative market of racist Southerners by [bemoaning](https://twitter.com/srhbutts/status/613490382937067520) the fact several retailers have voluntarily stopped selling products bearing the Battle Flag of the [Confederate States of America](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America "Confederate States of America"). As more stores ban sale of the Battle Flag, Gamergate co-opts it as a new symbol; Gamergaters are even using it in the #NotYourShield tag.
	- **Mark Kern** has an AMA on **/r/KotakuInAction** where he theorizes that other video game developers oppose Gamergate [don't understand what it's really about or they do understand and they're pussywhipped by their wives](http://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/3auc3t/hi_im_mark_kern_exwow_dev_and_president_of_league/csg1jmn). Game developer **Damion Schubert** [isn't so sure about that](http://www.zenofdesign.com/yes-some-devs-oppose-gamergate-on-principle/).
	- ***Voat*** announces they've [banned several subverses](https://archive.ph/eMnd7) (their version of subreddits) due to pressure from their hosting services and PayPal. These boards are /v/DoxBin, /v/Jailbait, /v/TrueJailbait, and /v/TheFappening.
- June 25: Several tech and gaming websites ([*International Business Times*](http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/batman-arkham-knight-includes-reference-gamergate-1507896), [*Polygon*](http://www.polygon.com/2015/6/25/8846691/batman-gamergate-easter-egg-arkham-knight), [*MCV*](http://www.mcvuk.com/news/read/batman-arkham-knight-has-a-dig-at-gamergate/0151716), [*Destructoid*](http://www.destructoid.com/really-hilarious-gamergate-joke-in-batman-arkham-knight-294753.phtml)) discuss the discovery of a joke at **Gamergate** 's expense in [*Batman: Arkham Knight*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman:_Arkham_Knight "wp:Batman: Arkham Knight"):

| “ ” "Y do u attack B@tman? He is BASED! U r a fa-"  Riddler deleted the email, and all the others like it, as prickly hot anger and shame squired through his insides. No point denying it: #CrusaderGate had been a disastrous social media campaign.  He couldn’t understand it. It seemed the internet's idiotic and easily roused rabble could froth itself into a full-fat cappuccino of frenzy over 'white knights'. But offer it up a Dark one - on a plate! - and you get a soy latte's worth of indignation at best! Didn't they understand what Batman had done? |

- June 26:
	- Gamergate attempts to sway children's author [Judy Blume](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judy_Blume "wp:Judy Blume") to their cause because , which to Gamergate means she's already on their side.
	- **"Lunar Archivist"** is [still sending reports](http://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/3b5clu/happening_cbc_the_phrase_when_anonymous_players/) to the CRTC.
	- **Margaret Pless** [raises issues](http://www.qaster.com/q/614487309128314880/) of **Allum Bokhari** 's original involvement in the #BurgersAndFries IRC channel, where he tried to rally the group into disrupting gaming convention PAX Prime.
- June 28: **Jason "@j\_millerworks" Miller** releases several Gamergate-themed books onto . He has priced his 50 page e-book *Beyond GamerGate: a PR Crisis Strategy Guide* at US$10, while *Sh\* t SJWs Say: The picturebook of the perpetually offended* (a collection of Twitter and Tumblr screencaps no doubt) is a much more affordable US$3.

### July 2015

- July 2: GamerGate discovers [an alleged tool that combs an](https://twitter.com/whenindoubtdo/status/616730968863281152) [ISIS](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/DAESH "DAESH") blocklist for Twitter usernames, and they're elated when they find their members on the list, allowing them to [tenuously link "anti-Gamergate" to ISIS](https://np.reddit.com/r/GamerGhazi/comments/3ca4v3/mark_kern_contacted_fbi_about_isis_using/). [It seems no other "resistance sites" link to this one, which is hosted in Arizona by GoDaddy](http://www.wholinks2me.com/details.php?url=kuffar.net&fr=details).
- July 3: **/r/GamerGhazi** [goes dark](https://np.reddit.com/r/GamerGhazi/comments/3c0atn/on_the_topic_of_our_blackout/) for several hours in [solidarity](https://np.reddit.com/r/Blackout2015) with the other subreddits messed around by Reddit's [corporate incompetence](https://np.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/3bxduw/why_was_riama_along_with_a_number_of_other_large/) (they open again when it's clear [their action has been co-opted by the FPH diaspora](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Reddit#.23RedditRevolt_is_revolting "Reddit")). **/r/KotakuInAction** remains open for business throughout [to discuss and document the blackout.](https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/3bycru/in_case_it_wasnt_obvious_kia_stands_with_the_subs/)
- July 4:
	- **Jordan Owen** announces the premiere of ***The Sarkeesian Effect***, to be at a Gamergate meetup in Atlanta on July 31st! However, he and **Davis Aurini** have [broken up](https://np.reddit.com/r/GamerGhazi/comments/3c53da/jordan_owen_announces_the_premiere_of_the/), again. Aurini announces [a new crowdfunding effort](http://fundanything.com/en/campaigns/the-sarkeesian-effect-post-production) for post-production on the film, without Owen's name on it; Owen [advises supporters not to give it any money](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6uJnBSJ69Q), Aurini [comes back again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvEssPhE10o)...
	- Kendra "HOTEL" McHale, a former Gamergater who helped organize a meetup in Victoria, British Columbia, [explains how she realized how bullshit the mob was](http://blacktridentmedia.com/2015/07/04/former-organizer-of-gginvic-speaks-up/) and why she left after becoming a victim to its harassment. She points out how complicit Gamergate is in harassment (calling it out is either stifling free speech or uncovering [No True Scotsman](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/No_True_Scotsman "No True Scotsman")), how Gamergate is a [crank magnet](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Crank_magnet "Crank magnet") for conspiracy theorists (primarily the [cultural Marxism](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Cultural_Marxism "Cultural Marxism") camp), and how appalled she was that Gamergate was being praised by ***A Voice for Men*** contributor Alison Tieman for accomplishing anti-feminism goals in less than a year, when Tieman and other *AVFM* people had been trying for over a decade. She terms her realization of the bullshit as "vomiting up the [red pill](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Red_pill "Red pill") ".
		- Gamergate's Norwegian contingent comes out in full force in the article's comments section because of McHale's reference to [Anders Behring Breivik](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Anders_Behring_Breivik "Anders Behring Breivik").
		- **Carl "Sargon of Akkad" Benjamin** quickly tries to deny everything McHale said and even denies McHale even exists, despite complaints from people in the GGinBC Skype chat that McHale was one of their associates.
- July 5: **/r/KotakuInAction** only now [discovers the results](https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/3c9oj0/acma_abc_australia_730_didnt_breach_standards_in/) of the **Australian Communications and Media Authority** 's investigation into ABC's *7:30*, clearing the news program of any complaints against ethical breaches, and are outraged.
- July 6: **Derek Smart** [tries to rope Gamergate into his campaign against *Star Citizen*](https://archive.ph/djWvY), a video game he crowdfunded that he has accused of being vaporware despite multiple updates about the development process. Over the next several months, Smart [digs an even deeper hole](http://www.pcgamesn.com/star-citizen/derek-smart-is-refusing-to-take-his-refunded-250-star-citizen-pledge-lying-down) [through multiple attempts](http://massivelyop.com/2015/07/17/derek-smart-has-fresh-demands-for-star-citizen-threatens-to-take-drama-to-the-new-york-times/) [at litigation against the developers](http://massivelyop.com/2015/08/24/star-citizen-threatened-with-class-action-lawsuit/), [who have chosen not to directly engage him](http://www.polygon.com/features/2015/8/31/9211969/what-the-hell-is-going-on-with-star-citizen) because [they know he never actually tested their product as he claims and used a fake address when receiving the refund they gave him in order to remain ligitious](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4497650/15-09-03_rsi-response-to-demand-letter.pdf). They also say that his history of not being able to publish a functioning or successful video game himself negates anything he has to say about their own beleaguered development on this multi-million dollar project.
- July 9: Gamergaters on **/r/KotakuInAction** (including the subreddit's moderators) [spam requests to /r/RedditRequest](https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/3cnxzv/humour_wow_weve_already_take_control_of_rkotaku/), a subreddit where people can take over abandoned subreddits, to take control of subreddits for names of gaming websites, arguing that the acquisition of /r/GamerGate (now **/r/GamerGhazi**) justifies their actions. As of writing, /r/polygon and /r/kotaku have been snatched up by Gamergaters; requests exist for /r/ign, /r/jezebel, /r/gamespot, /r/salon, and /r/rockpapershotgun.
- July 12: Following the announcement of the death of Nintendo president and CEO [Satoru Iwata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoru_Iwata "wp:Satoru Iwata"), Gamergaters tastelessly use it as a weapon against **Anita Sarkeesian** [by producing a fake set of tweets credited to her and distributing them in their circles](https://twitter.com/srhbutts/status/620464460575027201), knowing full well it was faked. A second fake tweet is attributed to ***Polygon*** allegedly mixing up Iwata with Nintendo game developer [Shigeru Miyamoto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shigeru_Miyamoto "wp:Shigeru Miyamoto"), later revealed to have been made by someone who runs an alleged rival website to *Polygon*. For once, **/r/KotakuInAction** users [urge people not to distribute the false information](https://np.reddit.com/r/GamerGhazi/comments/3d3h1h/credit_where_credits_due_kia_calls_out_fake/), but the conspiracies still fly.
- July 13:
	- **Michael Koretzky** [announces the details of the AirPlay panel](http://spjairplay.com/update5/), including allocating 15 minutes to define Gamergate (a huge time in real-time media), and coming to the realization that no one representing "anti-GamerGate" will come near this shit show.
	- **Ashe Schow**, a contributor to the right wing newspaper *The Washington Examiner* (where all she seems to write about is ), is added as a speaker at AirPlay at the request of her friend **Allum Bokhari**. She has never written about Gamergate before and has no video game experience. [Even Gamergaters don't like how she's been added as a panelist](https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/3d459k/happening_ashe_schow_washington_examiner/), as no one voted for her to be a representative; nor did they vote for Bokhari who previously was a committee member to pick the panelists in the first place.
- July 14: **Michael Koretzky** [realizes the mess he's involved in](http://spjairplay.com/update6/) after **Oliver Campbell** and Mark Ceb vociferously object to getting *only* 15 minutes to define Gamergate (before Koretzky realized no one "anti-GG" or "neutral" would show, he dedicated an hour, so each group could have its say), forcing him into an hour-long call that ate into his family time. During this call, Campbell revealed to Koretzky that he had been shown Koretzky's blog updates before they were posted. Koretzky only showed these to SPJ members and the Gamergater AirPlay committee members, which means one of the Gamergaters (later identified as "John Smith") had leaked the information to Campbell and others despite Koretzky's requests to keep things confidential. Ethics.
- July 15:
	- **Davis Aurini** [releases](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6AibgptNxc) 40 minutes of his "rough cut" of *The Sarkeesian Effect*. And [thirty minutes' ranting](http://www.staresattheworld.com/2015/07/the-sarkeesian-effect-update-preview/) about **Jordan Owen**.
		- **/r/GamerGhazi** [review](https://np.reddit.com/r/GamerGhazi/comments/3dc6pa/aurini_decides_to_release_40_mins_of_his_rough/)
		- **Dan Olson** [review](https://web.archive.org/web/20180215002358/https://storify.com/FoldableHuman/has-davis-aurini-ever-seen-a-documentary)
		- **Anita Sarkeesian** reviews [verbally](https://twitter.com/femfreq/status/621467859525328896) and [visually](https://twitter.com/femfreq/status/621460874356633600)
		- Owen [responds at length](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1bTPNdk5FI) (/r/Gamerghazi [summary](https://np.reddit.com/r/GamerGhazi/comments/3dhm85/latest_chapter_in_the_sarkeesian_effect_saga/))
		- Aurini [talks to](https://hailtothegynocracy.wordpress.com/2015/07/16/the-sarkeesian-effect-fallout-continues-in-an-interview-between-davis-aurini-and-matt-forney/) **Matt Forney** about Owen (audio and transcript).
	- **Oliver Campbell** [pulls out](https://writheinflame.wordpress.com/i-will-not-be-attending-airplay/) of AirPlay. **Michael Koretzky** [gets a bit terse](http://spjairplay.com/update7/).
		- Of note is **Eron Gjoni** of all people calling the previous update with regards to Oliver Campbell's behavior a "call-out".
	- The **Honey Badger Brigade** puts up their [legal draft](http://honeybadgerbrigade.com/2015/07/14/legal-draft-calgary-expo-expulsion-honey-badger-brigade-july-14th-2015/) against the Calgary Expo ([archive](https://archive.ph/JxfRh)), prepared by their disbarred lawyer. ([/r/GamerGhazi analysis](https://np.reddit.com/r/GamerGhazi/comments/3dfd9u/the_honey_badgers_have_posted_a_legal_draft/). The claim is... audacious.)
	- Following a Paris Gamergate meetup, *Le Monde* describes **Milo Yiannopoulos**, **Mike Cernovich**, and **Theodore Beale (Vox Day)** as "three ideologues trying to hijack Gamergate for their own benefit" ([" *Trois idéologues arrivés en cours de route, et tentant de détourner le mouvement à leur profit.*"](http://www.lemonde.fr/pixels/article/2015/07/15/a-la-rencontre-du-gamergate-le-mouvement-libertarien-qui-veut-defendre-ses-jeux-video_4683912_4408996.html?utm_medium=Social&utm_source=Twitter&utm_campaign=Echobox&utm_term=Autofeed#meter_toaster)).
	- **John "TotalBiscuit" Bain** [starts a Steam game curation group called "The Framerate Police"](https://www.pixeldynamo.com/news/gaming/2015/07/15/72372/total-biscuit-starts-framerate-police-steam-curator-page/). Its only purpose appears to be to identify video games that do not run at 60 fps.
- July 17:
	- The Internet as a whole condemns ***Gawker*** for the [publication of an article allegedly outing a major executive as gay](http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2015/07/17/gawkers-apparent-outing-cfo-meets-internet-backlash/30280505/). Gamergate shows up to lay claim to being against *Gawker* from the beginning, when it's simply an extension of their hatred for ***Kotaku*** and feminist affiliate *Jezebel*. Despite what they think, [being on the right side of an event for the first time in 11 months doesn't mean shit when it comes to the whole of their behavior](http://adamweinstein.tumblr.com/post/124342415120/goodbye-to-all-that-gawking).
	- [A new study is released](http://www.avclub.com/article/sexist-guys-suck-video-games-science-says-222487) correlating male gamers' sexist attitudes towards women with their decreasing scores in games.
	- The developers of *Guild of Dungeoneering* [block](http://steamcommunity.com/app/317820/discussions/0/535150948602382987/#c535150948602440575) **John "TotalBiscuit" Bain** 's "Framerate Police" curation group from curating their game. The lead game dev [reports being threatened for having blocked FRP](https://twitter.com/gambrinous/status/622186459953500160) and the group is unblocked.
	- After *GOG.com* promotes a sale for games picked by **John "TotalBiscuit" Bain**, Rowan Kaiser, a regular contributor at *The A.V. Club* and *Joystiq*, [discusses how Bain is a serial harasser](https://archive.ph/vgLIY) ([even before Gamergate when he used his Twitter followers to vote brigade on his behalf](https://np.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/1iqdc4/civilized_discussion_and_levelheaded_moderation/cb7eaul?context=8)) and that no gaming company should use him as a spokesman. Over the next few days, Gamergaters descend upon him, forcing him to close off his Twitter account while Gamergaters [conspire to report him to his superiors because he's insulting a cancer survivor (#NotYourShield, am I right?) and once mockingly called Bain "Tuberculosis"](https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/3durr8/rowan_kaiser_ign_and_av_club_writer_spills_his/).
- July 18: **Sam Smith** (a.k.a "Matthew Hopkins", a.k.a. "Vordrak") dives headfirst into the morass at **Wikipedia** in order to get **Mark Bernstein** banned. He is soon banned himself. He [writes a blog entry](http://matthewhopkinsnews.com/?p=1962) detailing the events of his ban, as well as [the fact he started up a subreddit for the sole purpose of disrupting Wikipedia in Gamergate's favor](https://np.reddit.com/r/TheGGGreatWork/) and started threads asking for ways to link Wikipedia to pedophilia. His blog entry also blames Wikipedia administrator Gamaliel for his ban; in fact, Floquenbeam is responsible for instituting the ban.
	- Of note, [Smith has a history of pedophilia-themed hyperbole](http://www.whtimes.co.uk/news/tory_new_boy_apologises_for_lib_dem_baby_rapist_comparison_1_18565).
- July 19: Rather than apologize for the actions of his rabid fanboys, **John "TotalBiscuit" Bain** [instead denies everything Rowan Kaiser said about him and instead blames Kaiser for the harassment he gets for being dehumanized](https://soundcloud.com/totalbiscuit/enough). Bain only denies the Gamergate involvement because he never directly linked to the original Five Guys videos by **MundaneMatt** and **Internet Aristocrat**; [he only namedropped Internet Aristocrat and directed his legion of fans to IA's channel to see MundaneMatt's video which had been taken down as a result of a DMCA claim which he bemoaned that it happened](https://np.reddit.com/r/GamerGhazi/comments/3dw0ly/totalbiscuit_responds_to_rowan_kaiser_theavclub/ct96z9q).
- July 20: **Michael Koretzky** announces that **Derek Smart** [will be joining the AirPlay speakers, representing a "neutral" stance on the subject](http://spjairplay.com/update9/), despite his prior attempts at using Gamergate to attack *Star Citizen*.
- July 21: A blogger [points out the hypocrisy within Gamergate](http://izana.bmrf.me/post/3) by showing how **Ethan "TheRalphRetort" Ralph** does everything that Gamergate claims to be against when attributed to their targets. Gamergaters at **/r/KotakuInAction** [respond by saying they shouldn't police others blogs](https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/3e1vx3/drama_an_expos%C3%A9_of_the_ralph_retorts_behaviour/), showing even more hypocrisy as **that's exactly what they do to their targets**.
- July 23: [Variloh, hardline Gamergater, discovers](http://www.manamonger.com/#!The-GamerGate-Batterd-Wife-Syndrome-Part-2-Sargon-of-Akkad/c1fyn/55b0122f0cf2f7a6a930068d) that **Carl "Sargon of Akkad" Benjamin** had used Kickstarter to defraud people and his close friends by raising money for a game they never released, and dissolving the private company the game was to be released by without notifying the other collaborators.
- July 24: **Caroline Sinders** [discusses how Gamergate SWATed her mother](http://boingboing.net/2015/07/24/that-time-the-internet-sent-a.html) after she began to investigate how to improve user experience on Twitter by examining how Gamergate operates.
- July 26: ***Know Your Meme*** moderators (yes, really) [temporarily shut down the comments section on the Gamergate page there](http://knowyourmeme.com/comments/2745385), recognizing how it has been used to abuse the system locally. A commentator on **/r/GamerGhazi** [states that the website's moderation team is mostly against Gamergate, and are hated by the Gamergaters using the page](https://archive.ph/htEhg).
- July 28: In a series of tweets, **Milo Yiannopoulos** [details the reasons he has become involved in Gamergate](https://archive.ph/edhIR): to use Gamergaters as pawns in the [culture war](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Culture_war "Culture war") against progressives.
- July 31: **Jordan Owen** 's version of ***The Sarkeesian Effect*** "premieres" at a Gamergate meetup in Atlanta. Total audience: [nine people, including Owen.](https://twitter.com/Shdwpaint_LisaM/status/627403001012031488)**Davis Aurini** is [not happy](https://twitter.com/Aurini/status/627411673662386176).

### August 2015

- August 1:
	- **Jesse Singal**, writing for *The Boston Globe*, [discusses his latest foray into](http://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/2015/08/01/gamergate-lives-but-attention-fades/xIHcjRrxP5WGcoEjTabAkM/story.html) **/r/KotakuInAction**, where he hypothesized that Gamergate had lost steam since **Sam Biddle** 's tweets. They disagreed. He reiterates his stance from October where he states Gamergate's decentralized nature will be its undoing, with regards to long-term relevance at least, and refutes that this is because of unfair coverage in journalism when capital A [Anonymous](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Anonymous "Anonymous"), which is structured in practically the same way, seems to maintain mainstream relevance.
	- Gamergaters on **/r/KotakuInAction** [celebrate the retirement of Independent Games Festival chairman Brandon Boyer](https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/3fcw17/brandon_boyer_leaves_the_igf/); they forget to mention he's retiring because he is undergoing treatment for cancer.
- August 2: **Christina Hoff Sommers** [is interviewed by](http://conversationswithbillkristol.org/video/christina-hoff-sommers/) **[William Kristol](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/William_Kristol "William Kristol")**. Gamergate is discussed. Before the interview is posted, **/r/KotakuInAction** [is mixed](https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/3fb7ys/christina_sommersbased_mom_discussing_gamergate/) as to whether or not having one of the most well-known [neocons](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Neocon "Neocon") and the man known in right wing circles as "The Guy Who's Wrong About Everything" in on Gamergate is a good thing; most know this proves their detractors right about them being a right-wing hate mob, while others think this will be beneficial for their campaign on Wikipedia for whatever reason and ignore those who say that Kristol is one of the worst journalists ever.
	- **Bob "MovieBob" Chipman** [provides his opinion on Kristol](https://twitter.com/the_moviebob/status/628048132702470145).
- August 3: **Eron Gjoni** [informs](https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/3fos8d/eron_here_sorry_for_the_delay_heres_that_legal/) **/r/KotakuInAction** that he is appealing his restraining order to the Massachusetts State Supreme Court. Aaron Caplan, a professor of law at Loyola, and [**Eugene Volokh**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Volokh "wp:Eugene Volokh") of [*The Volokh Conspiracy*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Volokh_Conspiracy "wp:The Volokh Conspiracy") fame have both filed *[amici curiae](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Amicus_curiae "Amicus curiae")* in Gjoni's favor.
- August 4:
	- **Daryush "Roosh V" Valizadeh** 's "gaming news" website ***Reaxxion*** [closes](http://wehuntedthemammoth.com/2015/08/04/roosh-v-shutters-reaxxion-his-dopey-game-site-for-masculine-men-due-to-people-forgetting-he-even-had-a-game-site/) due to lack of interest.
	- **Zoe Quinn** and **Anita Sarkeesian** [summarise events](https://twitter.com/femfreq/status/628654079498018816).
- August 6: **/r/KotakuInAction** has a thread about alleged "collusion" between Cory Doctorow and John Scalzi. [Scalzi responds](http://whatever.scalzi.com/2015/08/06/gamergate-adds-to-its-vast-warehouse-of-stupid/).
- August 8: Siobhan Thompson, a writer at *College Humor* posts [two](https://twitter.com/vornietom/status/630103145117450240) [tweets](https://twitter.com/vornietom/status/630104911099736064) mocking Gamergate. **/r/KotakuInAction** [has a conniption](https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/3ga970/the_hate_is_strong_with_this_one/), goes digging for [undisclosed affiliate links](https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/3gavuh/misc_college_humor_fails_to_disclose_affiliate/) and [decides to collectively report *College Humor* to the FTC](https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/3gc5ob/goal_message_ftc_about_college_humor_failing_to/). Anticipated results:

[![Two tumbleweeds rolling across the screen, from left to right.](https://rationalwiki.org/w/images/2/2f/Tumbleweed.gif)](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/File:Tumbleweed.gif)

- August 10: **Michael Koretzky** [claims that there have been attempts to stop AirPlay](http://spjairplay.com/update12/); he also claims that "a former international boxing champion" will be part of the event's security detail.
	(Side note: One of the so-called attempts to stop AirPlay was **Margaret Pless** [trying](https://twitter.com/idlediletante/status/630917492651782144) [to write](https://twitter.com/idlediletante/status/630918782836441088) [a story about him](https://twitter.com/idlediletante/status/630920802746150912).)
- August 11:
	- *[Al Jazeera](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Al_Jazeera "Al Jazeera") America* [publishes an op-ed](http://america.aljazeera.com/opinions/2015/8/the-invisible-hordes-of-online-feminist-bullies.html) by Megan Condis in which she denounces Gamergate's various instances of hypocrisy when it comes to attacking progressive voices. She cites their defense of a "free market" to decide what goes in video games while decrying how **Anita Sarkeesian** 's Kickstarter was successful enough that she should be allowed to create what she wants without their interference as well as their claims they stand for game creators' freedom of expression while attacking game creators who they don't like, such as **Zoe Quinn** and *Depression Quest*.
	- **Felicia Day** 's memoir *You're Never Weird on the Internet (Almost)* is released, and she discusses what happened to her with regards to Gamergate. In 2013, a group of posters on 4chan doxxed her, which led to a stalker make his way into her own home. She includes a tweet [^2] from when she spoke up against Gamergate in October. Gamergaters bombard [her book's Amazon.com page](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1476785651/) with bogus bad reviews. Someone better tell Anne Rice and the STGRB crowd.
	- [Gamergate turns](https://np.reddit.com/r/GamerGhazi/comments/3gnn2r/is_gamergate_still_telling_you_how_theyre_totes/) on **Margaret "@\_icze4r" Gel** when she criticizes how she has been treated from within the mob, in particular how Gamergaters wanted to use her being SWATed to suit their narrative.
- August 12: **Google** [delists](https://archive.ph/I1arZ) **8chan** from its search engines for "suspected child abuse content". 8chan [blames](https://i.imgur.com/e37Nmdp.png) **/r/GamerGhazi**; **/r/KotakuInAction** [blames](https://i.imgur.com/1nRNmGS.png) **Dan Olson** and **Sarah Nyberg**. There remains no evidence the child porn on 8chan was put there by anyone other than its regular users.
- August 13:
	- **/r/KotakuInAction** [cries censorship](https://np.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/3gt7gj/kia_has_a_thread_discussing_a_deleted_thread_in/) over a moderator of /r/books deleting a thread they started about **Anne Rice**, leading to moderators being threatened.
	- *The Seattle Times* [profiles](http://www.seattletimes.com/pacific-nw-magazine/game-on-women-are-developing-new-video-games-and-a-new-culture/) **Zoe Quinn** one year after **Gamergate** began, and speaks to Kate Edwards, executive director of the **International Games Developer Association** and former game developer for Microsoft where she worked on *Halo*; Alyssa Jones, game producer at Microsoft and organizer of GeekGirlCon; Kim Swift, game designer at Amazon Game Studios who previously worked on *Portal*; and students at the DigiPen Institute of Technology.
- August 14: The originally planned release date for *Afterlife Empire*, the game funded by **4channers** -cum- **Gamergaters** through **The Fine Young Capitalists** to give themselves good PR for superficially supporting a so-called "feminist" cause. However, hours before its intended release, [TFYC says they're delaying it to work on bugs reported to them by their early-access key backers](http://thefineyoungcapitalists.tumblr.com/post/126669817225/with-a-heavy-heart-we-say).
- August 15:
	- The SPJ AirPlay event is held in Miami, organized by Society of Professional Journalists Regional Director **Michael Koretzky**. Unlike the premiere of *The Sarkeesian Effect*, the attending audience is in the double digits.
		- The morning panel, featuring **Allum Bokhari**, **Mark Ceb**, and **Ashe Schow**, discusses five instances of unethical video game journalism within the past 5 years. The first two both concern Patricia Hernandez, a woman discovered to be friends with **Zoe Quinn** through Gamergate's digging; the first so-called lapse is [an *opinion* piece](http://kotaku.com/a-different-way-to-respond-to-a-rape-accusation-update-1605542083) she wrote, and the second is not disclosing her friendships with Anna Anthropy, Christine Love, or **Zoe Quinn** when writing articles that mentioned them or their work (even when those articles resembled nothing like a review). The third is about [Jeff Gerstmann's firing from *GameSpot* for writing a negative review of a video game heavily advertised on the website](http://www.gamefront.com/jeff-gerstmann-finally-talks-about-gamespot-firing/). It's too bad that all of these happened before Gamergate was ever a thing and were only discovered because of Gamergate's hatred for Quinn, or fell way outside Gamergate's 5-year historical limit. They run out of time before getting to the next two points.
		- While this goes on, the YouTube live stream's comment section is flooded with ASCII swastikas, racial epithets, and at some point Koretzky and other panelists are [doxxed](https://twitter.com/srhbutts/status/632630161993633796).
		- **Derek Smart**, who is supposed to represent a "neutral" stance, [is reported as saying this is a victory against SJWs](https://np.reddit.com/r/GamerGhazi/comments/3h3f6g/spj_airplay_starts_soon/cu403qq).
		- After lunch, the afternoon panel featuring **Milo Yiannopoulos**, **Christina Hoff Sommers**, and **Cathy Young** is set to start and discuss how the media should cover Gamergate and controversies like it, but Yiannopoulos and Hoff Sommers derail it into an attack on feminism, with Koretzky doing his best to get things back on topic. Before anything else can happen, [two bomb threats are called in to the Miami Police Department and *The Miami Herald*](https://np.reddit.com/r/GamerGhazi/comments/3h4glz/spj_airplay_suspended_after_receiving_10_bomb/), forcing the venue and nearby homes to evacuate; Koretzky had previously said that [bomb threats would not have been an issue](http://spjairplay.com/update12/). When the event is restarted, Koretzky allegedly uses a homophobic slur to start things off well. **Oliver Campbell** apparently also shows up despite his dramatic departure weeks earlier.
		- An individual claiming to be [the same person who threatened](https://twitter.com/Spacekatgal/status/582244838072025089) **Brianna Wu** when one of her dogs had died and [the one who attempted to SWAT](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/01/8chan-tries-swatting-gamergate-critic-sends-cops-to-an-old-address/) **@pixelgoth** [claims responsibility for the threat on AirPlay](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CMe8w-sUcAABQKP.jpg); the 8chan thread containing posts by the individual is [later scrubbed of all evidence](https://np.reddit.com/r/GamerGhazi/comments/3h57pd/that_was_fast_no_good_tragedy_gone_unexploited/cu4e4j5).

They then [open their inbox to accept editorials](http://risemiaminews.com/2015/08/write-a-reasoned-opinion-piece-about-gamergate-and-well-probably-publish-it/); as of writing, only one editorial critical of Gamergate has been submitted, and that's after they had to ask Gamergaters to stop sending them editorials featuring pro-Gamergate opinions.

	- Daniel Nye Griffiths, another blogger on *Forbes*, [writes a much more in depth entry on AirPlay](http://www.forbes.com/sites/danielnyegriffiths/2015/08/16/a-somewhat-illuminating-mess-gamergate-on-stage-at-airplay-opinion/), noting:
		- The poor attendance.
		- Lynn Walsh's "I hope you get to work with a good journalist" comment to **Milo Yiannopoulos** that may or may not be intentionally a sick burn.
		- How much Gamergate doesn't really matter if they're at best a few thousand people on the Internet.
		- How incredibly uncontroversial actual better ethics in video game journalism is.
		- How the actual journalists asked to appear already know how shitty a baseline *Gawker* is.
		- How Yiannopoulos, **Christina Hoff Sommers**, and **Cathy Young** are more appropriate for a panel on opposition to feminism rather than how to best discuss video game journalism, considering Yiannopoulos and Sommers tried to hijack the panel into being one on being anti-feminists.
		- How Gamergaters praise any sort of mainstream media message about them to use as tools in their war on Wikipedia.
		- And how anyone trying to discuss Gamergate a year after it started is at best 10 months late and people can see what Gamergate really stands for in their behavior rather than trying to interrogate them directly.
	- Donald Clarke at *The Irish Times* [is more or less coerced by Gamergaters into covering AirPlay on his blog](http://www.irishtimes.com/blogs/screenwriter/2015/08/16/gamergate-event-disrupted-by-bomb-scare/) (having done so in October), and he deduces that it accurately shows Gamergate supporters' stance on things when 5 out of the 6 people chosen to represent them are all right-wingers, when Gamergaters continue to assert that they are apolitical.
- August 17:
	- **Michael Koretzky** [pens his thoughts on AirPlay](http://spjairplay.com/update13/), coming to the conclusion that Gamergate has both the people who believe in improving ethics in journalism on video game websites and people like **Milo Yiannopoulos** and **Christina Hoff Sommers** who only want to preach to the anti-feminism crowd, despite his attempts to steer the conversation back to being about ethics in video game journalism. He described the afternoon's bomb threat as a "mercy killing".

He debunks their claim that the mainstream media ran with a narrative against them when many news outlets (including gaming websites) covered both sides of the story and determined that Gamergate was not what its supporters claim it is. And it highlights the fact that *Breitbart* is the only major website that has consistently pushed any pro-Gamergate material, while several others did not make the cutoff at an [Alexa](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Alexa "Alexa") ranking of 11,000, arguing that they were far too obscure to have any significant impact.

	- **Eugene Volokh** posts his *amicus* brief to his blog *The Volokh Conspiracy* on *The Washington Post*. His opinion is that **Eron Gjoni** 's right to free speech was unfairly restricted by the restraining order preventing him from posting information about **Zoe Quinn** on the Internet. His argument rests on his insistence that "The Zoe Post" is protected speech despite having incited others to criminal activity because it lacked an imminent direction to readers. This argument is somewhat weakened because Gjoni has been on record as saying he wrote and shared "The Zoe Post" to cause the most damage to Quinn as possible and has actively participated in and conducted the mob to accomplish his goals, though the imminence of the acts he intended to incite is debatable, and is unfortunately potentially relevant from a legal standpoint. [Not to mention that the incentive he gave to the Gamergaters funding his legal battle is a sequel to "The Zoe Post".](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/05/17/1385386/-Eron-Gjoni-raises-6-767-from-Gamergate-to-Defend-Restraining-Order-Violations)

	- *HuffPost Live* broadcasts the first of a week's worth of interviews concerning Gamergate. The first topic is ["What the Internet Got Right & Wrong in #GamerGate"](http://live.huffingtonpost.com/r/segment/gamergate-year-anniversary/55c41d1802a76091d10001f1), and features guests Andrew Eisen (*GamePolitics*), **Caroline Sinders** (digital anthropologist and computer scientist for IBM Watson), and David Rudin (*Kill Screen Daily*). All point out that Gamergate is what its participants want it to be at any particular time, and there is infighting within Gamergate as to what Gamergate is even about, Gamergate's tendency to dogpile and sealion, gatekeeping, and how the panelists will be "investigated" for participating in the panel and being critical of Gamergate.
	- **Theodore Beale (Vox Day)** releases his *magnum opus* *[SJWs Always Lie: Taking Down the Thought Police](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B014GMBUR4/)*. "It analyzes well-known SJW attacks as well as the two most successful examples of resistance to the SJW Narrative, #GamerGate and Sad Puppies." Somehow he gets 200 pages out of this. It also features two Chapter 5s. For those who don't remember, Beale nominated himself for Best Editor in his Rabid Puppies slate at the 2015 Hugo Awards.

The two Ms. Youngs claim Gamergate was unfairly covered and that the liberal-leaning gaming publications led to this unfair coverage. Singal points out that Gamergate has yet to admit that it is political and conservative and that most of their complaints center around alleged progressive totalitarianism, which is the only way Cathy Young at *Reason* fits into Gamergate's Venn diagram of "ethics". The issue of harassment is raised, and Georgina Young mentions that it should just be expected of being someone on the Internet with some form of celebrity, brushing it off, shortly after Singal points out that Gamergaters seem to lack any and all empathy for those who say that they've been subject to the harassment she thinks is no problem to her personally.

	- The third *HuffPost Live* segment discusses ["#GamerGate: Gender Violence & Online Threats"](http://live.huffingtonpost.com/r/segment/gamergate-year-anniversary/55b7d0c878c90acf34000117), featuring guests **Brianna Wu**, Shannon Sun-Higginson (director of documentary [*GTFO*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GTFO_\(film\) "wp:GTFO (film)")), and Jenny Haniver (*Not in the Kitchen Anymore*). As in her editorial in *The Guardian* the week before, Wu says how Gamergate isn't itself *the* problem but rather a symptom of the larger problem of sexism in the video game and tech industries, and how when women say anything, they're harassed and they are not welcome in the gaming industry. Haniver discusses sexist comments and threats she has received simply by playing video games, and says that it's "horseshit" to believe Gamergate has nothing to do with sexist harassment in video games and the tech industry. Sun-Higginson mentions how her film *GTFO* was based on the toxicity within the video game scene long before Gamergate happened and how it only enforced what her film covered. Wu mentions how no one in Gamergate seems to have empathy for the people who are attacked, and how they attack the character of herself, **Zoe Quinn**, and **Anita Sarkeesian** in order to justify the other attacks they make on them, and they fight so they can't be held accountable for things done by the whole. Moderator Caroline Modarressy-Tehrani brings up what Georgina Young said the previous day with regards to threats being just something that happens on the Internet, and Wu responds that all harassment is reprehensible but Gamergate is indeed involved in what has happened to her and others. Haniver says that just because the threats are online doesn't make them any less serious. Sun-Higginson states that if it's about ethics in journalism, then it makes no sense that the majority of the women attacked are not journalists, and no one has denounced the trolls operating within Gamergate but rather relied on the [No true Scotsman](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/No_true_Scotsman "No true Scotsman") fallacy to deny culpability.
	- Gamergaters go after Ice-T after resurrecting their hate boner for the *Law & Order: SVU* episode "Intimidation Game", [prompting this response from him](https://twitter.com/FINALLEVEL/status/636919323605487617). After sealioning him for hours, Ice-T says he is "pro-gamer" and tells them to ignore what the press says about gamers, which Gamergate takes as support for their side.

	- *HuffPost Live* broadcasts its fourth and final discussion on Gamergate ["#GamerGate: Authorship In The Online Space"](http://live.huffingtonpost.com/r/segment/gamergate-year-anniversary/55b7d0f62b8c2ad40e00012a), featuring Jennie Bharaj (*BasedGamer*, a perennially failed Gamergate start-up), Elissa Shevinsky (author of *Lean Out*), **Michael Koretzky**, and of all people **Oliver Campbell**. Shevinsky, who claims "neutrality" on Gamergate, says "there's trolls on both sides" and "there needs to be proper investigative journalism into Gamergate" (there has been a ton of investigative journalism, but Gamergaters never like the results showing that they're a bunch of misogynistic assholes). Bharaj talks about the "love" she receives from Gamergate, tries to advertise her website and plenty of other pro-Gamergate websites, and goes into a nice [victim blaming](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Victim_blaming "Victim blaming") and " [professional victim](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Professional_victim "Professional victim") " downward spiral by saying people who get harassed online shouldn't talk about it or else they're just opening themselves up for more harassment. Koretzky blames the "biased" coverage on "lazy journalism" stemming from young journalists not reporting original content and old editors not knowing what Gamergate even is. Campbell parrots Koretzky's talking points, pats himself on the back for getting screencapped and posted on Imgur, compares Gamergate to [Black Lives Matter](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter "Black Lives Matter") (after Koretzky already said it was a poor example because BLM and [Occupy Wall Street](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Occupy_Wall_Street "Occupy Wall Street") have representatives and Gamergate doesn't), calls himself the best person to talk to about Gamergate, gets called out by a commentor that his Twitter feed seems to be filled with anti-feminist and anti-SJW rhetoric, and somehow tries to generalize all gamers' opinions on politics in games after Caroline Modaressey-Tehrani tried to press him for his own personal opinion on the matter.
	- Reddit user "The\_YoungWolf" [posts his research regarding Gamergate's origins](https://np.reddit.com/r/AgainstGamerGate/comments/3iqq7e/an_essay_on_gamergates_pol_origins_and_evolution/), showing extensive logs of both original 4chan posts on the "politically incorrect" board /pol/ that shows they were the ones to push Gamergate and attacks on **Zoe Quinn** onto other websites, and it wasn't necessarily the video games board /v/, proving Gamergate's origins in misogyny and reactionary voices rather than a concerted effort to push for better "ethics in video game journalism". He also cites #BurgersAndFries IRC channel logs showing the early decision to rope in attacks against **Anita Sarkeesian** into "The Quinnspiracy" by appealing to **Phil "thunderf00t" Mason**, coordination of #NotYourShield, the movement's obsession with " [Cultural Marxism](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Cultural_Marxism "Cultural Marxism") ", its concerted efforts to defend **8chan** from the accusations of hosting pedophiles and child pornography, and its direct connections to the **/baphomet/** board. He concludes that Gamergate doesn't actually want to hold a proper conversation with anyone because they can't win, and they don't want to organize in any way because the harassment they perpetuate would be incredibly easy to trace back to them instead of when they pretend it's not from Gamergaters.
		- Commenters in the thread realize that he is right that Gamergaters do not want to have a conversation. They simply want to win in an argument and validate Gamergate as a result.
	- A Gamergater [falsely claims to have communicated with the murderer](http://www.wsbtv.com/news/news/local/local-gamer-says-he-communicated-shooter-killed-jo/nnS4Z/) of [Alison Parker and Adam Ward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murders_of_Alison_Parker_and_Adam_Ward "wp:Murders of Alison Parker and Adam Ward"), claiming he supported Gamergate. Gamergaters get mad that the lie has been circulated because people and the local news affiliate actually believed it. A completely separate Gamergater decides to be an asshole and changes their Steam profile information to that of the shooter.
	- **Jordan Owen** releases an [update](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3dspTBT4vM&feature=youtu.be) on ***The Sarkeesian Effect*** (actual information from 1:19 on): the film is finished, it's 2 hours 35 minutes, he has a distributor, and it will have some sort of release in the next few weeks and backers will get their promised swag. His next project will apply everything he's learnt on this one. "EVERYTHING." The update itself suggests he's been spending a bit much time watching David Lynch.

	- **Anita Sarkeesian** [speaks to Jessica Valenti for *The Guardian*](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/aug/29/anita-sarkeesian-gamergate-interview-jessica-valenti) about how her life has changed due to the attacks as a result of her project, as well as from Gamergate. She says that the media has actually ignored the facet of Gamergate that it was started as domestic abuse against **Zoe Quinn** by **Eron Gjoni** and that if it truly is about ethics in video game journalism then it makes no sense that no journalists were victimized to the extent Quinn, themself, and other women were. Sarkeesian also directly connects Gamergate to the harassment that surrounded her Kickstarter in 2012.

	- Gamergater "TheLeoPirate" doubles down on Gamergate's baseless attacks on **Sarah Nyberg** by publishing a video accusing her of being a pedophile, accompanying it with the hashthag "#FreeEncyclopediaDramatica". The evidence used against her is gleaned from nearly 10-year-old IRC chatlogs obtained from when Gamergaters hacked her personal websites wherein, and here's the kicker, ***she is explicitly expressing disgust with having found pedophilic roleplaying*** on LiveJournal ***that she was not engaging in herself***. Gamergate has for months been accusing her of pedophilia because of she had copied and pasted the content and they removed the context that showed [she was clearly against it](https://twitter.com/srhbutts/status/561381294526177280). The fact that this information has been available for 7 months at this point, [alongside debunked accusations that Nyberg is the "Sarah Butts" who wrote for *The Mary Sue* that they have other context-less chatlogs that may not even be from Nyberg](https://archive.md/GVPe8), shows the ethical standards of people who align with *Breitbart* in action.
	- Chelsea Clinton [tweets out support](https://twitter.com/ChelseaClinton/status/638351131706568705) for **Anita Sarkeesian** with regards to the article in *The Guardian*. Gamergaters don't react until about a week later.

### September 2015

- September 3: Attorney Richard DeLossa of Kelley Drye discusses the legal battles between **Zoe Quinn** and **Eron Gjoni** on the *Drye Wit* blogs. He agrees with **Eugene Volokh** 's determination that the restriction on Gjoni from posting about Quinn could be considered [prior restraint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prior_restraint "wp:prior restraint") and that "encouragement \[of\] hate mobs" doesn't fall within the incitement of violence exceptions of the First Amendment, he notes that the Massachusetts courts never decided whether or not the content of the original writing of "The Zoe Post" was unlawful and defamatory. If that is determined, it could prevent Gjoni from repeating content within "The Zoe Post" considered as such, and modifications (or expansions) to the original to sidestep his injunction would easily broaden it to cover the new content. Like his planned sequel if the court clears his restraining order.
	(As with *The Volokh Conspiracy* 's blog entry, the *Drye Wit* blog entry is omitted as it uses Quinn's former name. But unlike Volokh, DeLossa actually refrained from repeating this name repeatedly throughout his writing.)

	- Peter Moore, COO of video game publisher Electronic Arts, [reveals Gamergate helped see that EA had an issue when it comes to gender diversity](http://fortune.com/2015/09/04/ea-peter-moore-on-women-in-gaming/).
	- **Katherine Cross** writes for *Jacobin*, [covering how Gamergate's Vivian James represents Gamergate's ideal woman](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/09/ashley-madison-gamer-gate-vivian-james/) that they had to manufacture themselves and how they paint her as a victim of Gamergate's strawman critics.
	- **Milo Yiannopoulos** [admits that he publishes libel from 8chan threads on Gamergate victims for *Breitbart* articles](https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/3jl1kv/happenings_so_milo_from_breitbart_posted_this/cuq67wq?context=3); such as the one he has published on **Sarah Nyberg** covering the rehashed false accusations against her (which took several days and 7 revisions by *Breitbart* editorial and legal staff because of all the libel he pulled from 8chan and /r/KotakuInAction).
		- As a side note to this, some of the chat logs that Gamergaters are using to attack Nyberg with [were apparently uploaded to the server in question on August 12, 2015](https://np.reddit.com/r/GamerGhazi/comments/3jmr6u/debunking_the_latest_damning_log_leaks_targeting/), bringing into question their authenticity. However, Nyberg would later [acknowledge](https://medium.com/@srhbutts/i-m-sarah-nyberg-and-i-was-a-teenage-edgelord-b8a460b27e10) that the logs are authentic.
- September 5: The Digital Rights Foundation, a Pakistani civil rights group, holds an event on misogyny on the Internet and brings up Gamergate as an example. [The person who announces this speech on Twitter comes under immediate attack by Gamergaters](https://web.archive.org/web/20160322044928/https://storify.com/DigitalRightsPK/we-had-a-session-on-online-misogyny-in-pakistan).
- September 8: After posters on **/r/KotakuInAction** are critical of ***Breitbart*** 's ethics, **Milo Yiannopoulos** decides the honeymoon is over, saying [KIA doesn't know what bad journalism is](https://archive.ph/wBl51) and [their reputation is going down the toilet and is no longer useful as a journalistic source](https://archive.ph/BFPN0). Three stopped clocks in a row, even though they're more of a threat that he's going to abandon supporting Gamergate unless he and *Breitbart* become sacred cows for them.
- September 9: A Gamergater calls into [Sam Seder](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Liberal_talk_radio#Sam_Seder "Liberal talk radio") 's show *The Majority Report* [to try to say something about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHL1y00lPMY) **Sarah Nyberg**. After asking the caller why this matters to which the caller cannot properly form a response, Seder shuts him down by saying that the actions of this one person that he personally does not know about at all does not have any impact on his own opinions on Gamergate.
- September 10: \[Date uncertain\]Formation of /8diamonds/ on 8chan. The board is essentially /baphomet/ 2.0 but unlike its predecessor, Gamergaters don't even try to hide the fact that they have connections to it.
- September 11: Vlad Chituc at *The New Republic* [identifies Gamergate as a culture war](http://www.newrepublic.com/article/122785/gamergate-culture-war-people-who-dont-play-videogames), involving people who don't play video games (as evidenced by the participation of **Milo Yiannopoulos**, **Christina Hoff Sommers**, and **Cathy Young** at the SPJ AirPlay event) and that it is not between libertarians and authoritarians as Gamergate supporters seem to suggest but rather between people who exalt free expression and people who value equal protection of marginalized voices. Chituc also points out research that shows media does affect people's perception of others (despite what Gamergate wants to believe), with sexist statements coming from studies revolving female video game characters and how positive depictions of the African American community in *The Cosby Show* and gay people in *Will & Grace* and more recently *Modern Family* have changed American attitudes towards the marginalized groups.

	- **Brianna Wu** [reports that a Gamergater has been arrested by the FBI on terrorism charges](https://twitter.com/Spacekatgal/status/642567948587134976), later linking to an [article on *The Daily Beast*](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/09/11/terrorist-troll-pretended-to-be-isis-white-supremacist-and-jewish-lawyer.html) discussing the FBI's arrest of **Joshua Goldberg** of [Florida](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Florida "Florida"). Goldberg had been arrested after weeks of monitoring on suspicion of plotting a terrorist attack in Kansas City. He had been operating many, many, MANY alternate identities for malicious purposes, primarily used to attack opponents of hate speech. The most notable of these identities was the pro- [DAESH](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/DAESH "DAESH") handle "Australi Witness", which is what led to his arrest when he told an FBI informant how to make a pressure cooker bomb like the ones used in the [Boston Marathon bombing](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Boston_Marathon_bombing "Boston Marathon bombing"). However, he used his personal screen name "Moon Metropolis" to [support Gamergate](https://archive.ph/7dYL2) and also attack **Anita Sarkeesian** [since 2012](https://archive.ph/cD1oR).
		- Wu [discovers that Goldberg fed](https://twitter.com/Spacekatgal/status/642573831081734144) **Milo Yiannopoulos** the false story that [Black Lives Matter](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter "Black Lives Matter") activist Shaun King was allegedly white.
		- People uncover a tweet by Goldberg as "Moon Metropolis" [where he falsely represented himself as a woman](https://twitter.com/DiscordianKitty/status/643004038959767552). #NotYourShieldInAction
		- Redditors at /r/AgainstHateSubreddits [identify Goldberg's Reddit accounts](https://np.reddit.com/r/AgainstHateSubreddits/comments/3kkumc/terrorist_connected_to_reddit_arrested/) "Emily\_Americana" and "European88", both infamous for racist shitposting. The latter account moderated over 100 racist, misogynistic, and anti-Semitic subreddits, including several for 8chan and several named after African Americans killed by police and nearly 30 of these were "Quarantined" by Reddit under their new terms of service.
		- **Mark Kern** [gets on the first $3 million bus out of Gamergate after the news goes around](https://twitter.com/Grummz/status/642581822933635072). Although it may instead be because Gamergaters called him out on misgendering Sarah Nyberg, not because misgendering is fucking wrong but because it would make Kern look bad.
		- **Milo Yiannopoulos** [is caught trying to delete every Twitter conversation he had with Goldberg](https://np.reddit.com/r/GamerGhazi/comments/3knbhn/a_collection_of_archived_things_from_milo_for_the/), [and denies he used Goldberg as a source](https://twitter.com/ashleylynch/status/642637851792932864). And he, like many other Gamergaters, [believes that there's a conspiracy against him because he recently released his hitpiece on Sarah Nyberg](https://twitter.com/SuperSpacedad/status/642809414416658432) (when his hit piece is what distracted everyone from the 2 day old news that Goldberg was arrested). He also tries to pin things on other people as one of Goldberg's personas [tried to get close to Brianna Wu](https://twitter.com/ashleylynch/status/642781500757426176) [and used this "feminist" persona to write about his own activities on *The Daily Kos* 's open submissions](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/09/12/1420671/-Much-Feared-Australian-Da-ish-Jihadist-Posted-Here-on-dKos). However, this persona was as strawman feminist as they came and served only to further Goldberg's free speech extremist views.
	- **Zoe Quinn** and **Anita Sarkeesian** [speak at the XOXO Festival](http://www.theverge.com/2015/9/14/9326207/zoe-quinn-gamergate-xoxo-festival). Quinn discusses how they empathized with Gamergate's supporters who were probably only a part of the movement for the sake of fitting in with people they think are cool online. Quinn also discusses how their harassers, and other online harassment groups, all think they're heroes in thinking they're heroes fighting an elite and corrupt evil "like some kind of crappy internet Batman", seeing as there are conspiracies built around victims of online harassment (including Quinn themself) being rich and powerful. Sarkeesian also touched upon the harassment she receives on a daily basis, but said that she has seen positive movement from the video game industry inviting her to studios to discuss how to improve their characters and stories.
- September 14:
	- **Jordan Owen** 's cut of ***The Sarkeesian Effect*** is [released on Vimeo... behind a paywall](https://vimeo.com/ondemand/thesarkeesianeffect). One intrepid viewer concludes it's "too boring, even for a hate watch". It takes over an hour to even mention Gamergate and lies about how Zoe Quinn was involved in it. Even 40 minutes in, the viewer can't discern a narrative or argument being made. [Jack Thompson](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Jack_Thompson "Jack Thompson") goes [Godwin](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Godwin%27s_Law "Godwin's Law") when he compares Anita Sarkeesian receiving a video game industry award to receiving an award from Nazi Germany. In the end, the brave viewer who spent US$4 to rent the film for 48 hours gave this review: ["In summary: incompetent, boring and incoherent. No idea what the film was meant to say but I am sure it failed."](https://twitter.com/betsyinferno/status/643520167012663296)
		- [Commenters on /r/KotakuInAction say](https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/3kyiwp/the_sarkeesian_effect_inside_the_world_of_social/):
			- "Sorry, not drunk enough to watch it. I'll later.:)"
			- "Haven't watched it myself either, waiting for a torrent to pop up."
			- "No, thank you. I need my IQ in order to get through life."

	- **Sarah Nyberg** [responds to the allegations Gamergate has made on her which were published](https://medium.com/@srhbutts/i-m-sarah-nyberg-and-i-was-a-teenage-edgelord-b8a460b27e10) by **Milo Yiannopoulos**, owning up to her past as a 4chan veteran trying to out-do others through being edgy. She also calls out the hypocrisy of Gamergate falsely attacking and reporting others of being pedophiles when they organize their actions on a website so infamous for hosting child pornography that it's been delisted from Google and cannot be funded through normal means. One point she makes is that she hired a lawyer and contacted the police and both examined the reports against her and saw no reason to believe that she committed any crime.
- September 18: Gamergaters try to start "Operation Poly Gone" to contact the FTC over ***Polygon*** contributor Samit Sakar not "disclosing his friendship" with an executive producer at Disney Interactive when covering *Disney Infinity* or with a public relations writer at Harmonix and his former boss at *Destructoid* when covering *Rock Band 4*. In two days, #OpPolyGone is tweeted only 150 times. Compare this with how much energy they have expended attacking Sarah Nyberg in the same period.
- September 21: [The BBC covers the](http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-34292809) **Joshua Goldberg** case, revealing more of his impersonation victims and that he is currently undergoing psychiatric evaluation to see if he is competent to stand trial.
- September 22: [Justin Trudeau](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Justin_Trudeau "Justin Trudeau"), leader of the [Liberal Party of Canada](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Liberal_Party_of_Canada "Liberal Party of Canada") (and Prime Minister come October 19), [names Gamergate as an issue regarding discrimination against women](https://www.thestar.com/news/federal-election/2015/09/22/justin-trudeau-points-finger-at-communities-for-causing-violence-against-women.html).
- September 23: **Zoe Quinn**, **Anita Sarkeesian**, **Randi Harper**, Feminista Jones, Rose Eveleth, Jamia Wilson, and the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative [work with Google Ideas to fight online abuse](https://twitter.com/googleideas/status/646783722570682369). Gamergaters react predictably enough that [Google Ideas responds to make that point themselves](https://twitter.com/googleideas/status/646795257057669124).
	- **Derek Smart**, the so-called "Gamergate neutral", joins in on Gamergate's attack on Google, [calling in the big dogs](https://twitter.com/dsmart/status/646853502304669696) **Milo Yiannopoulos** and **Mike Cernovich**.
- September 24:
	- **Zoe Quinn** and **Anita Sarkeesian** [speak](http://www.unwomen.org/en/news/stories/2015/9/un-women-at-the-un-general-assembly) at the [United Nations](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/United_Nations "United Nations") General Assembly as part of UN Women's report on *Cyber Violence Against Women & Girls: A Worldwide Wake-Up Call*. It will be broadcast live [here](http://webtv.un.org/search/launch-of-the-broadband-working-group-on-gender-report/4506718502001) (Quinn and Sarkeesian begin speaking around 1:22:30).

	- Gamergate's list of boycotts grows to include American anime distributor [Funimation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funimation "wp:Funimation") after [this sick burn](https://vine.co/v/ePY7XLqrrZZ) made its way into the English dub of [*Prison School*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison_School "wp:Prison School").[They begin to form conspiracies](https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/3m62pl/prison_school_anime_dub_gamergate_reference_does/) after finding a screenwriter who follows **Brianna Wu** and **Anita Sarkeesian** on Twitter ([despite the fact she didn't write the line](https://twitter.com/marchimark/status/647090904914784256)), and decide to stick with their anime snobbery by declaring fansubs better than dubs (not that they would ever pay to watch an anime like this anyway).
	- **Randi Harper** [comments](https://twitter.com/randileeharper/status/646919645409247232) on **Derek Smart** 's attack on her and others for their participation in Google Ideas' online abuse project, saying he propositioned her.

	- Gamergaters on the subreddit /r/AgainstGamerGate (meant to serve as a "neutral" ground where people with opposing stances can debate) feel that the sub has gone too "anti-Gamergate" for their liking [and announce a fork off](https://np.reddit.com/r/AgainstGamerGate/comments/3mhxde/an_alternative_to_ragainstgamergate/) to /r/GGDiscussion.
- September 28:
	- **Jesse Singal** [points out the problems with the UN Broadband Commission's report](http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2015/09/uns-cyberharassment-report-is-really-bad.html), including its unfortunate use of a [Lyndon LaRouche](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Lyndon_LaRouche "Lyndon LaRouche") crony's puffpiece for LaRouche as a citation, and its errors only seem to empower the people attacking Gamergate's targets.

Gamergate freaks out because apparently the paragraph preceding the excerpt needs to be attributed to whatever *Polygon* staff member who wrote it (and later they just changed it to be under his own name). [Owen responds](https://twitter.com/philrowen/status/648651505029935104), [and then more seriously](https://twitter.com/philrowen/status/648737730738847744).

### October 2015

- October 1:
	- **Zoe Quinn** and **Randi Harper** [speak to *Motherboard*](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/im-disappointed-zoe-quinn-speaks-out-on-un-cyberviolence-report) about how bad the UN Broadband Commission's report was, such as the LaRouche supporter citation, as well as the inclusion of sex trafficking, sex work, and pornography which had no place in the discussion. Quinn and Harper both feel that the writers of the report had an agenda concerning pornography and anonymity on the Internet.
	- Chris Roberts, lead developer of *Star Citizen*, [responds](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/comm-link/transmission/14979-Chairmans-Response-To-The-Escapist) to [an article](https://archive.ph/pYhrP) on ***The Escapist*** which repeats all of **Derek Smart** 's attacks on his game while claiming the comments come from former employees. He points out that the author is **Lizzy Finnegan** and may be pursuing her own agenda with the article considering the lack of ethics in her reporting.
	- In response to news and general chatter that the suspect in the [Umpqua Community College shooting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umpqua_Community_College_shooting "wp:Umpqua Community College shooting") had posted his intent to massacre on 4chan's /r9k/ board, **Zoe Quinn** [notes that /r9k/ is where Gamergate began and where people also said they wanted to murder her](https://twitter.com/TheQuinnspiracy/status/649695501743337472). Gamergaters [go apeshit](https://np.reddit.com/r/GamerGhazi/comments/3n6lsd/kia_discusses_freedom_of_speech_in_the_wake_of/), saying she's making it about her (she isn't) and that they shouldn't discuss gun control (totally not a conservative mob guys).
- October 2: ***The Escapist*** [hastily releases a response](https://archive.ph/i72zD) to **Chris Roberts** saying that their sources are legitimate and totally not **Derek Smart**. Posters on the *Star Citizen* subreddit [discover that several of the statements](https://np.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/3n6lum/escapist_anonymous_sources_uncovered/) in **Lizzy Finnegan** 's original article appear verbatim on Glassdoor reviews for *Star Citizen* 's development studio and they were all posted within the same week.
	- Chris Roberts updates his post from the previous day to include a formal response to *The Escapist* 's edits. These include points that Roberts' wife and RSI's head of marketing Sandi Gardiner was never contacted to give her side of the claims against her despite *The Escapist* insisting they did, the "anonymous sources" were a group of former employees who all knew each other and acted in concert to sell the story, that there was no way to even contact the people who posted the shit reviews on Glassdoor because there's no messaging system there, *The Escapist* 's claim that one of the sources was vetted because he had shown his company ID card is false because RSI doesn't give out ID cards, that *The Escapist* was not the only website sold the story and other websites had been contacted to publish the attacks but *The Escapist* was the only one to bite, Derek Smart called Roberts personally to tell him the story was going out hours before it went up, and that Lizzy Finnegan has zero background in journalism to be trusted with a story like this, particularly because she extensively talks to Derek Smart on Twitter (more than any Gamergater can point out that someone who said "Gamergate is bad" follows Zoe Quinn and tweeted at her once). **Derek Smart** claims [inside knowledge](https://twitter.com/dsmart/status/650757017632641024).
- October 3:
	- FUNimation [issues a non-statement](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/daily-briefs/2015-10-03/funimation-addresses-prison-school-dub-comments-over-gamergate-line/.93736) with regards to the email campaigning Gamergate did in response to the line in the *Prison School* episode.
	- Gamergaters [start a petition](https://www.change.org/p/federal-federal-bureau-of-investigation-urge-the-us-to-arrest-ms-anita-sarkeesian-and-ms-zoe-quinn-for-violating-the-logan-act) to get **Zoe Quinn** and **Anita Sarkeesian** arrested under...the [Logan Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_Act "wp:Logan Act")? Apparently the UN Broadband Commission and UN Women count as a foreign government with which the U.S. is at war and Quinn and Sarkeesian are supposed to be arrested because they are attempting to use a foreign government to stifle American constitutional protections to free speech. So not only is Gamergate totally not about these two women, Gamergaters are experts at applying an esoteric law favored by xenophobic conspiracy theorists that in 200 years has only resulted in one indictment.
	- **Milo Yiannopoulos**, along with fellow reactionary Lauren Southern, [attends a slut walk in his own special way](https://twitter.com/Nero/status/650406237645836288) and is appalled when he and Southern are removed from the event for "telling" the women their "opinions" on [rape culture](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Rape_culture "Rape culture"). [Gamergate gets angry for them](https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/3ndo8a/misc_milo_lauren_southern_ejected_by_lapd_from_la/).
- October 5: **Zoe Quinn** [responds to the petition to have them tried for treason under the Logan Act](https://twitter.com/TheQuinnspiracy/status/651138796356943872).
- October 6: The **Honey Badger Brigade** reveals more of their plans for their lawsuit against Calgary Expo. Their requested damages? $50 grand. The amount they raised to hire their *disbarred* lawyer? $40 grand.
- October 7: A representative for the UN International Telecommunication Union [apologizes for the inaccuracies and poor sourcing in the Broadband Commission's report](http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/10/un-agency-backtracks-expresses-regret-over-cyberviolence-report/), saying the original version was rushed. An [updated set of highlights from a new version of the report](http://www.broadbandcommission.org/Documents/publications/bb-wg-gender-report2015-highlights.pdf) is released, omitting many of the problematic and irrelevant topics found in the original report.
- October 9:
	- The UN Broadband Commission begins the #TakeBackTheTech hashtag to better discuss the issues of threats against women online. [Gamergate reacts predictably](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CQ4os_YWUAIxRUF.png:orig).
	- *Quartz* [analyzes the #ShoutYourAbortion hashtag](http://qz.com/520309/how-to-tell-whether-a-twitter-user-is-pro-choice-or-pro-life-without-reading-any-of-their-tweets/), made in response to the U.S. Congress trying to defund [Planned Parenthood](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Planned_Parenthood "Planned Parenthood"), and finds an overlap between conservative Twitter users and Gamergaters with regards to opposition to the hashtag.
- October 10: **Randi Harper** [reveals that Gamergaters have used the hacked Patreon data to dox her patrons and intimidate them to stop funding](https://twitter.com/randileeharper/status/653053731919892481), as well as send the information off to **Milo Yiannopoulos**.
- October 11: **Eron Gjoni** [does "research"](https://archive.ph/HqRci) to prove the *Quartz* article from the other day wrong by asking Gamergaters to RT his question asking if they're pro-choice. Ethics ensues.
- October 12:
	- **Anita Sarkeesian** [visits](https://twitter.com/femfreq/status/653674266362187776) Bungie (*Halo*, *Destiny*) to give a talk. Gamergaters get angry.
	- **Randi Harper** [reveals that](https://twitter.com/randileeharper/status/653719956253618176) **Sam Smith** (a.k.a "Matthew Hopkins", a.k.a. "Vordrak") is currently trying to blackmail her Patreon donors to stop supporting her through an email campaign where he threatens to contact their employers. Not only [does she also state that Smith tried to get her fired from running her own non-profit](https://twitter.com/randileeharper/status/653721878503161857) but [one of her patrons shows that the email Smith sent was flagged as spam](https://twitter.com/cdaveross/status/653724842731003904).
- October 13:
	- In a stopped clock moment, posters on /r/KotakuInAction [call out](https://archive.ph/eWRXO) **Sam Smith** (a.k.a "Matthew Hopkins", a.k.a. "Vordrak") [for the bullshit he pulled](https://archive.ph/FCRnR).
	- It turns out [Gamergaters are actually trying to conspire against the United Nations for having](http://www.undispatch.com/gamergate-vs-the-united-nations/) **Zoe Quinn** and **Anita Sarkeesian** speak during a panel on violence against women online. Gamergaters are currently fighting people who have been active for years in trying to ensure human rights offline apply to online, while believing that their right to free speech is somehow going to be suppressed by intergovernmental cooperation to end online harassment.
- October 17: Gamergaters on /r/KotakuInAction [have a grand old time](https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/3p5em7/based_sam_harris_mentions_gamergate_in_this/) when [Sam Harris](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Sam_Harris "Sam Harris") uses a mention of Gamergate to verbally criticize western feminism.
- October 20:
	- Gamergaters [proudly claim responsibility](https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/3phype/never_underestimate_your_power_or_actual_size_gg/) for having increased *Breitbart* 's web traffic by 75% in the past year. But they're totally not right wing, guys.
	- Gamergaters take **Sarah Nyberg** being critical of a video game developer's statements [as a sign she's starting a campaign against him so they proactively go after her more](https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/3pjtmh/pedophile_sarah_nyberg_is_trying_to_start_a/).
	- **The Open Gaming Society** [announces that their panel has been approved and will be at SXSW in March](http://www.theopengamingsociety.org/savepoint-is-a-go/). Their speakers are: SPJ AirPlay veteran Lynn Walsh, Gamergate's official weaponized porn star **Mercedes Carrera**, completely unknown game developer Nick Robalik of Pixel Metal Studios, and The Open Gaming Society's own Perry Jones.
- October 23: *Motherboard* criticizes **SXSW** [for failing to acknowledge safety concerns](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/sxsw-has-approved-a-gamergate-panel) with regards to **The Open Gaming Society** 's panel which is transparently about Gamergate, considering two prior Gamergate-oriented events were subject to bomb threats. The Open Gaming Society's founder Perry Jones says his group keeps a "neutral stance" on Gamergate, despite the obvious links all of the panel's proposed speakers have with it.
- October 26:
	- **Caroline Sinders** and **Randi Harper** both say that their SXSW panel with **Katherine Cross** on preventing harassment online [has been cancelled](https://twitter.com/carolinesinders/status/658743209808568320) [because of violent threats](https://twitter.com/carolinesinders/status/658743209808568320). **Ashe Schow** reports that the Gamergate panel (which she actually refers to as such) [has also been cancelled](https://twitter.com/AsheSchow/status/658753510880759808), while equivocating the others' panel as "anti-Gamergate".
	- SXSW [releases a statement](http://www.sxsw.com/news/2015/sxsw-statement-hugh-forrest) on their decision to cancel both the Gamergate panel and the anti-harassment panel after having announced their inclusion the week before. Their explanation also plays into a balance fallacy.
	- **Zoe Quinn** [reveals details they know about Gamergate's intended SXSW panel](https://twitter.com/TheQuinnspiracy/status/658779650529751040).
		- The panel [was planned openly on Reddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/3hx0u3/sxsw_gamergate_panel_topic_discussion/), like previous attempts at falsely presenting a legitimate face.
		- **Mercedes Carrera** was herself involved in Gamergate's last attempt at trying to have a legitimate face when it came to the **AbleGamers** charity stream debacle.
		- Nick Robalik has sent her several dozen harassing messages on Twitter and even stalked her at a convention he had spoken at, and took a photo to prove it to Gamergate.
		- "The Open Gaming Society" has only been around since March 2015 because it is solely an attempt for Gamergate to have a public face while still repeating all of their debunked talking points.
		- The final speaker on the panel would have been Lynn Walsh, one of the speakers at AirPlay who was supposed to represent the uninvolved Society of Professional Journalists.
		- And Quinn had sent SXSW their concerns about the panel and its members' prior actions but received no response other than a confirmation that their email had been received.
	- Perry Jones [announces that host the panel somewhere else with their own money](http://www.theopengamingsociety.org/savepoint-dear-community/). Sounds like another fundraising campaign.
	- **Sarah Nyberg** reveals that a founding member of **The Open Gaming Society** [was a Gamergater who doxxed her earlier in the year](https://twitter.com/srhbutts/status/658795590910943232).
- October 27:
	- In the wake of the **SXSW** panel cancellations, people uncover **The Open Gaming Society** 's ["Doctrine of Gaming"](http://www.theopengamingsociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/the-doctrine-of-gaming-4-0.pdf) and have a field day with how this was supposed to be Gamergate's Trojan Horse into legitimacy. And also **Mark Kern** signed it twice. And not even in two separate parts of the document. There are only 6 signatories, and he's two of them.
	- BuzzFeed and Vox Media [withdraw from participation](http://recode.net/2015/10/27/buzzfeed-to-withdraw-from-sxsw-unless-organizers-reverse-panel-cancelations/) in **SXSW** unless the cancelled panels are reinstated.
	- *The Mary Sue* [reports on the **SXSW** cancellations](http://www.themarysue.com/sxsw-cancels-panels/), and notes that **The Open Gaming Society** 's founder Perry Jones revealed that the issues with hosting their panel was with regards to event resources, and not at all the threats levied at the other panels. The response he received from SXSW also shows how much the event organizers are applying a [balance fallacy](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Balance_fallacy "Balance fallacy") to Gamergate those victimized by the mob.
	- **Arthur Chu** [writes about his experience](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/10/27/this-is-not-a-game-how-sxsw-turned-gamergate-abuse-into-a-spectator-sport.html) in dealing with **SXSW**, including his attempts to have festival organizers prevent and remove harassing comments left on the brigaded panel voting pages as well as how he was misled into believing Gamergate's "Open Gaming Society" panel would not have been approved at all, considering it was never put up to public vote and it never went past the panel advisory committee, meaning SXSW staff approved it without any oversight. He calls bullshit on how Randi Harper's anti-harassment panel as being cancelled to serve as some sort of "anti-Gamergate" panel to appease Gamergaters, when **Chris Kluwe** somehow managed to evade Gamergate's attention altogether in the voting process with his anti-harassment panel which explicitly mentioned Gamergate in its description.
	- **Brianna Wu** [speaks to *The Frame*](http://www.scpr.org/programs/the-frame/2015/10/27/44999/an-avoidable-mess-gamergate-target-brianna-wu-addr/) and says that this could have all been avoided, because she and others have been to smaller venues where security issues were handled much better, but Gamergate had set a precedent that if they threaten violence no one gets free speech.
	- *Re/code* [is told by sources](http://recode.net/2015/10/27/exclusive-after-gamergate-misstep-sxsw-weighing-an-all-day-forum-on-online-harassment/) that **SXSW** is attempting damage control by dedicating an all-day event on panels to combat online harassment. The panel hosted by **Randi Harper**, **Caroline Sinders**, and **Katherine Cross** has been reinstated, but there is no information on the panel by **The Open Gaming Society**.
- October 28:
	- The [American Civil Liberties Union](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/American_Civil_Liberties_Union "American Civil Liberties Union") [releases a statement](https://www.aclu.org/blog/speak-freely/say-it-aint-so-sxsw-2016) on **SXSW** 's mishandling of the panel cancellations and how their actions have effectively made them succumb to the [Heckler's veto](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Heckler%27s_veto "Heckler's veto").
	- Former Texas State Senator and gubernatorial candidate [**Wendy Davis**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wendy_Davis_\(politician\) "wp:Wendy Davis (politician)") [condemns](https://twitter.com/wendydavis/status/659413247842525185) **SXSW** for empowering misogynist harassers.
	- **Leigh Alexander** [writes in *Wired*](http://www.wired.com/2015/10/sxsw-diversity-gamergate/) how she had been contacted after SXSW 2015 for her input on a panel discussing Gamergate at the 2016 event. She had advised the SXSW representative to avoid focusing on harassers and also avoid having the victims come in and talk about their experiences, but rather have a forum to discuss anti-harassment and community-building as well as discussions on the creations and perspectives of women and other marginalized voices in tech. Alexander recognizes that SXSW wants to have diversity of opinions at their event, but they refused to acknowledge one group's concerns as a result.
	- **Chris Kluwe** [writes on the blunder by **SXSW**](https://the-cauldron.com/sxsw-s-astounding-ideals-of-cowardice-871764d3eb45#.d25fr7wkf) in his own way, particularly how none of the events cancelled had anything to do with Gamergate other than the panelists being harassed nonstop for a year by Gamergaters, as well as criticize them for allowing the obvious Gamergater panel through without any outside insight.
	- **Milo Yiannopoulos** 's use of Gamergate to boost his readership on *Breitbart* leads his editors [to place him in charge of their new technology section](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-27/breitbart-news-is-preparing-to-troll-tech). Questions posed to him by Gamergaters [and his answer of not knowing how to answer](https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/3qh8vk/im_milo_yiannopoulos_the_new_technology_editor_of/cwf7ezg?context=3) instead shows how little he actually knows about technology (which is apparently nothing at all).
- October 30:
	- **SXSW** [officially announces](http://www.sxsw.com/news/2015/sxsw-announces-march-12-online-harassment-summit) the reinstatement of **Randi Harper** et al.'s panel "Level Up: Overcoming Harassment in Games" as well as **The Open Gaming Society** 's Gamergate Trojan Horse "SavePoint: A Discussion on the Gaming Community" and that they will be part of an Online Harassment Summit at SXSW on March 12, 2016. Others who will speak as part of the summit include **Brianna Wu**, Rep. **Katherine Clark** (D-Mass.), **Wendy Davis**, [Anti-Defamation League](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Anti-Defamation_League "Anti-Defamation League") CEO Jonathan Greenblatt, amongst several professors of law and civil rights advocates.
	- **Randi Harper**, **Caroline Sinders**, and **Katherine Cross** [all announce their intentions not to participate](http://recode.net/2015/10/30/sxsw-bungles-announcement-of-online-harassment-summit-and-panelists-are-pulling-out/) in **SXSW** 's anti-harassment summit so long as **The Open Gaming Society** 's Gamergate smokescreen panel is included as part of this event. **Brianna Wu** and Sarah Jeong (*Motherboard*) also announce they will not be participating in the event so long as the Gamergate panel is considered part of the anti-harassment summit. Harper [says she is trying to work with SXSW to solve the problems they keep getting themselves into](https://twitter.com/randileeharper/status/660202054908928000). Earlier in the day, [she revealed](https://twitter.com/randileeharper/status/660159003108859904) **Mercedes Carrera** was directing her followers to harass her; **Milo Yiannopoulos** felt left out after Harper said her panel wouldn't participate if he showed up at SXSW, [so he joined in the dogpiling as well](https://web.archive.org/web/20170113130853/https://storify.com/freebsdgirl/a-lesson-in-dogpiling).
- October 31: [Australian Greens](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Australian_Greens "Australian Greens") Senator [Scott Ludlam](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Scott_Ludlam "Scott Ludlam") [speaks to *Mashable*](http://mashable.com/2015/11/08/gamergate-scott-ludlum-australia/) at PAX Australia on how a government would not be able to solve a problem like Gamergate directly. Making a law wouldn't solve Gamergate, but understanding the issues of gender and diversity that caused it would help understand how to address the concerns on a larger scale.

### November 2015

- November 3: **Arthur Chu** [writes about how much **SXSW** fucked up](http://www.salon.com/2015/11/03/gamergate_rides_again_corporate_arrogance_just_turned_sxsws_big_tent_into_a_three_ring_circus/) by including **The Open Gaming Society** 's panel as part of the "anti-harassment summit" when they were told multiple times that Gamergaters on that panel are responsible for the harassment directed at the women on the other panel, as well as the speakers they had asked to participate in the talk.
- November 5: Another Gamergate sockpuppet came to light when "Alison Prime" attempted to raise money to assist their family in recovering from a housefire. "Alison Prime" had previously been held up by **Christina Hoff Sommers** at AirPlay as "a lesbian gamer who apparently enjoys gazing at images of busty women," which proved that Gamergate was not just a bunch of anti-social losers living in their parents' basements. "Alison Prime" [also reported that they were driven to tears](https://archive.ph/v9V9W) when **Tim Schafer** made jokes using a sockpuppet at the GDC Awards. And on top of all of that, "Alison Prime" denied that transwomen could truly understand the plight of women like "her" - because they never had a uterus, [claiming hers was removed](https://archive.ph/3EvWn) while making a transphobic attack on **Brianna Wu**. All of this came crashing down when ["Alison Prime" was called out by the person whose photos they were using to pose as a woman](https://twitter.com/AshleyRiotArt/status/662197845726900224). Nacho shield.
- November 6: **Zoe Quinn** is writing a memoir titled *Crash Override: How to Save the Internet From Itself*, to be published by Simon & Schuster's Touchstone imprint in September 2016. [The film rights to the memoir have been acquired by Amy Pascal](http://deadline.com/2015/11/zoe-quinn-crash-override-gamergate-memoir-amy-pascal-1201611420/), the result of a bidding war by several movie and TV studios, and Scarlett Johansson is one of many actresses interested in starring.
- November 13: **SXSW** [announces more speakers](http://www.sxsw.com/news/2015/more-speakers-announced-online-harassment-summit) for their anti-harassment summit. **Randi Harper**, **Caroline Sinders**, and **Katherine Cross** will be holding their anti-harassment panel as part of the summit, as the **Open Gaming Society** 's panel will not be part of the summit but be held on a completely different day.
- November 14: **Veerender Jubbal** [discovers that Gamergaters had photoshopped one of his selfies](https://twitter.com/Veeren_Jubbal/status/665546510013038592) into framing him as one of the terrorists responsible for the attacks in Paris (and also adding a dildo in the background). Sky News Italy [uses the photo in a story on the attacks](https://twitter.com/SkyTG24/status/665684025953165312). Gamergaters [gloat that they've created unethical journalism](https://twitter.com/iglvzx/status/665739566649741312) and **Milo Yiannopoulos** [openly mocks and threatens to write an article on Jubbal](https://twitter.com/Nero/status/665716568781926400); he follows through with it the next day and fills it full of tweets Jubbal made mocking white people but titles it in a way that makes it seem he's sympathetic.
- November 17:
	- *Vice* [proves that Gamergaters are to blame](http://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/gamergate-members-are-responsible-for-the-terrorist-photograph-of-journalist-veerender-jubbal-503) for modifying **Veerender Jubbal** 's photo, following days of denial from Gamergaters that one of their own was responsible, by pointing out that the original editor of the photograph has also attacked other Gamergate critics and targets with other edited photos and that the person disseminating the photograph is heavily involved in Gamergate as evident by his posting in /r/KotakuInAction which had been deleted by the forum's moderators to hide evidence.
		- Gamergaters deny that moderators of /r/KotakuInAction have been covering up evidence, pointing to how the individual deleted his entire account on Reddit, but /r/KotakuInAction has a public log of all moderator actions and [the post is clearly shown as having been deleted by a mod of KIA rather than as a result of closing the account](https://twitter.com/iglvzx/status/666733508707028992).
			- The moderator in question [deleted the post because the author of the *Vice* article hadn't archived it, a "rookie mistake"](https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/3t80j9/moderator_logan_mac_deleted_a_kia_comment_by_the/cx4d6vt).
	- **Arthur Chu** [writes about Gamergate's treatment of Jubbal](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/11/17/the-making-of-a-terrorist-how-i-was-framed-for-the-paris-attacks-by-gamergate-trolls.html), and how Gamergate only persists through their own actions as a gamification of social media presence.
- November 22: Gamergaters [have rallied behind](http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2015/11/22/1453239/-Meet-The-Guy-who-Earned-40k-in-Legal-Fund-Donations-After-Stalking-Feminists-on-Twitter) Gregory Alan Eliott, a Canadian man facing criminal harassment charges for cyberstalking and threatening two feminists over Twitter, after all of their figureheads and general right wing rag writers in Canada willingly misinterpret the case against him as one of freedom of his speech and feminists arguing with him and calling it harassment when he responded back (all while the complainants cannot respond in public until the sentencing in January 2016). To date, he has received over US$40k.
- November 23: The *Columbia Journalism Review* [examines why Gamergate and the Society of Professional Journalists have become entwined](http://www.cjr.org/analysis/gamergate_spj_ethics.php), highlighting how Gamergate sees endorsement by the SPJ as a means to have the media relabel them away from being a hate mob and how the SPJ may be seeking to revitalize itself by courting video game reviewers. Others that spoke to *CJR* were more critical, with some saying that there's pressure against the media to write a factual record of what has happened and others who believe that Gamergate shouldn't be approached by the media in this way as they are nothing more than trolls or rather they are not a group with a fringe movement but the fringe movement itself and it sets up a [false equivalence](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/False_equivalence "False equivalence") between Gamergate supporters and their critics.
- November 24: Japanese video game developer Team Ninja reveals that Koei Tecmo's *Dead or Alive Xtreme 3* [won't be released in the west](http://www.kotaku.co.uk/2015/11/24/why-the-next-dead-or-alive-xtreme-beach-volleyball-game-wont-leave-japan) allegedly over the issues surrounding the depiction of women in video games in western countries. The manager of the Twitter account for import website Play-Asia [blames it on SJWs](http://www.themarysue.com/play-asia-facepalms/) and promises to sell the Asian editions of the games which come with English subtitles. This is all despite [the fact no one in the west ever gave a shit about *DOAX3* to petition it not be released](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Manufactroversy "Manufactroversy").
- November 30: The **Honey Badger Brigade** [reveals](https://archive.ph/7GlSX) that the disbarred lawyer they hired with Gamergater money told them to sue the wrong legal entity to get back at Calgary Expo for kicking them out. They seem to ignore Calgary Expo's explanation that there was never a contractual obligation between the event organizers and Honey Badger Alison Tieman, and even if there was a contract, Tieman and her associates violated it and therefore they had the right to kick them out. But no, it's Harry Kopyto's fault for picking the wrong target and not a complete waste of a bunch of Canadian taxpayer and reactionary idiot money.

### December 2015

- December 1: Breitbart writer **Richard Lewis** [taunts and attacks a notable esports](http://www.pcgamer.com/richard-lewis-dreamhack-esports-update/) player and Gamergate [instantly joins his side](https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/3v22sy/drama_richard_lewis_breitbart_esports_columnist/), despite [overwhelming evidence](https://np.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3ul9s2/so_i_go_and_talk_to_rlewisreports_and_he/cxfr4jm) of the Lewis' culpability and [eye witness accounts](http://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1snvdg2).
- December 2:
	- **Jesse Singal** [debunks a story](http://nymag.com/following/2015/12/debunking-a-gamergate-terrorism-rumor.html) **Milo Yiannopoulos** had "reported" on that the UK Home Office had begun telling teachers to distribute material labeling Gamergate as a terrorist organization alongside DAESH and the [English Defence League](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/English_Defence_League "English Defence League"). Singal uncovered that the printout was not a government mandate.
	- Yiannopoulos responds to a request for comment that he did contact the school and someone in the headmaster's office informed him that the terror warning came from "the government".
- December 3: **Jesse Singal** updates his article to say that it appears that Yiannopoulos never actually contacted the school in question, despite his claims in his piece on *Breitbart*. He received a comment from the school that denies that anyone there ever spoke to **Milo Yiannopoulos**. Yiannopoulos doubles down when confronted over the fact he lied.
- December 7: After ***The Washington Post*** publishes an [opinion piece that links Gamergate and GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/act-four/wp/2015/12/07/donald-trump-is-the-gamergate-of-republican-politics/), [Gamergate is affronted](https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/3vtr79/donald_trump_is_the_gamergate_of_republican/) and [harangues the writer](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23gamergate%20to%3AAlyssaRosenberg%20since%3A2015-12-07&src=typd) on social media.
- December 10: In order to protest against what Gamergate considers "censorship" of Japanese video games, Gamergate starts a [hashtag](https://archive.ph/8z4GB) [campaign](https://archive.ph/7xpFU) **#1MillionGamersStrong** and [a petition](https://www.change.org/p/koei-tecmo-capcom-namco-monolith-soft-ncsoft-1-million-gamers-strong-for-japanese-gaming). [As critique arises](https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/3wex8l/surprised_the_1milliongamersstrong_petition_wasnt/) within Gamergate itself, the campaign fails to attain 1 million signatures on the petition.
- December 14:
	- - Gaming channel **Twin Galaxy** starts [the **#Right2Game** campaign](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/twin-galaxies-right2game-campaign#/) in order to promote "the benefits of gaming". Gamergate subreddit [/r/Kotakuinaction decides to back the campaign](https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/3x4b3a/stan_lee_and_some_other_celebs_are_trying_to_get/), after the campaign curator [shows up in a relevant KiA thread](https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/3x4b3a/stan_lee_and_some_other_celebs_are_trying_to_get/cy1xooc). The #right2game hashtag is [taken over by Gamergate activity](https://archive.ph/33xqq) and Gamergate [lashes out against anyone](https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/3yogrk/archivistbecks_is_attacking_jace_halls_right2game/) who dares to point out Gamergate's dominance over the campaign.
	- ***Kotaku*** [first points out Gamergate's hatred](http://kotaku.com/from-japan-with-changes-the-endless-debate-over-video-1747960323) for **Alison Rapp**, an employee at Nintendo who works with the "Treehouse" localization team. They're upset that the international editions of *Xenoblade Chronicles X* have not only removed the player avatar breast size slider but also the option for a ***thirteen-year-old*** female character to wear a bikini. Rapp is a marketing specialist and does not work on localizing video games. Gamergate doesn't care to recognize this because she's a woman with progressive social views.
- December 29: Due to the slow decline of the Gamergate hashtag, Twitter is no longer auto-completing it. [Gamergaters call this censorship](https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/3ykz4z/twitter_is_censoring_our_hashtags/).

## 2016

### January 2016

- January 6: One year after **Intel** began its campaign for more diversity, the company [re-affirms its stance and aims to broaden](http://www.engadget.com/2016/01/05/intel-gamergate-response/) its endeavors to fight online harassment.
- January 8: **Milo Yiannopoulos** [loses his "Verified" tick on Twitter](https://archive.ph/P1fcw) for many TOS violations. Both [Milo](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CYPIyARUoAED54e.png) and [/r/KotakuInAction](https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/403plb/censorship_twitter_bullshit_milo_yiannopoulos/) ([more](https://twitter.com/aguyuno/status/685754342956216320)) consider this a vitally important free speech issue. The tag [#JeSuisMilo](https://twitter.com/search?f=news&vertical=news&q=jesuismilo&src=typd) shows up on Twitter. **Ethan "TheRalphRetort" Ralph** [blames](http://archive.ph/s4B7E) **Randi Harper**, who is mostly [amused.](https://np.reddit.com/r/GamerGhazi/comments/4045j5/milo_loses_verified_tag_on_twitter_throws_fit/cyrgss5)
- January 9:
	- After **Milo Yiannopoulos** loses his little blue "verified" checkmark on Twitter, **Breitbart** publishes a [stirring indictment](http://archive.ph/sQ1HD) of this terrible assault on freedom.
	- After months of silence, Youtuber **John "TotalBiscuit" Bain** [steps into the Gamergate fray again](http://i.imgur.com/KDSiL1M.png), repeating long debunked talking points and once again promoting the movement. [His own fans](https://archive.ph/bqLUA) as well as [Gamergate are delighted](https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/404af2/rcynicalbrit_has_civil_discussion_on_gamergate/).
- January 11: As if Gamergate's #JesuisMilo campaign had not already been embarrassing enough for the movement, it adds [a petition to the U.S. President](https://archive.ph/cyS5w) to its efforts.
- January 16: After **Stolen!**, an app which uses a Twitter API to turn user profiles into a trading game, [gets pulled by its creators](http://www.theverge.com/2016/1/14/10773026/stolen-twitter-game-pulled-from-app-store) due to privacy concerns, [Gamergate takes up its banner](https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/411ght/happening_major_happening_feminist_representative/). US representative **Katherine Clark**, who asked for the cancellation of the app, instantly [gets attacked on Twitter by Gamergate](https://archive.ph/Lllsv), while the journalist who broke the story [also gets harassed](http://nymag.com/thecut/2016/01/female-journalist-harassed-for-writing-about-app.html).
- January 17:
	- After **Anne Wheaton**, wife of actor and prominent Gamergate critic **Wil Wheaton**, [leaves Twitter due to harassment](https://archive.ph/Gfty6), [Gamergate is delighted](https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/41ayz2/drama_anne_wheaton_mrs_shut_up_wesley_leaves/).
	- As its funding time draws to a close, TwinGalaxies' **#Right2Game** campaign [falls short of its goal](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/twin-galaxies-right2game-campaign#/). It had become [almost indistinguishable from Gamergate](https://archive.ph/33xqq), after its founder had [only ever spoken to Reddit's Gamergate subreddit](https://archive.ph/bRjwp) during the funding period.
- January 18: Comedian and actress **Amy Schumer** [objects to a statement](https://archive.ph/DpCMY) made by a critic on Twitter. The critic apologizes and [Schumer accepts the apology](https://archive.ph/COsIt). This is reason for **Breitbart** [to bash Schumer](https://archive.ph/fzVYd) and [Gamergate instantly joins in](https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/41kwnw/misc_amy_schumer_publicly_shames_17_yr_old_film/), because of "ethics in video game journalism" or something.
- January 21: After **Nintendo** decides to [rework a controversial scene](http://www.techradar.com/news/gaming/if-you-think-nintendo-censored-fire-emblem-fates-you-re-wrong-1313676) during the localization process of the game "Fire Emblem Fates", Gamergate instantly [targets female Nintendo employee](https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/422gwy/nintendo_treehouse_manager_alison_rapp_goes_full/) **Alison Rapp**, again, instigated by Gamergate-affiliated [game dev **Mark Kern**](https://archive.ph/pq2ek). Rapp's personal information [is spread on Reddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/422gwy/nintendo_treehouse_manager_alison_rapp_goes_full/cz7guhv) and in other Gamergate forums.
- January 22: When a harassment case against a Canadian activist with a [history of harassing](https://soundcloud.com/dougjh/greg-elliot-stalks-and-beats-women-in-real-life) women [falls apart in court](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/twitter-harassment-trial-verdict-1.3415112), Gamergate [celebrates the "defeat"](https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/425x0s/happenings_gregory_alan_elliott_not_guilty/) of the plaintiffs, two feminist activists. The hashtag **#FreedomofTweets** [quickly turns into a toxic mess](https://archive.ph/tKYNI) from the usual Gamergate activists and allies, it [results in new harassment](http://www.buzzfeed.com/ishmaeldaro/canada-twitter-harassment-case-online-backlash#.qyMxKPWZoa), while Gamergate [makes "demands" towards the Canadian government](https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/4269jo/attention_canadian_government_it_is_not_enough/%20).
- January 23:
	- It is uncovered that Gamergate-affiliated gaming site ***The Escapist*** [has hired **PressFarttoContinue**](http://www.escapistmagazine.com/forums/read/663.933243-The-Escapist-Has-Hired-PressFartToContinue-The-Same-Guy-Who-Harassed-Stalked-Dodger#23486028) (AKA Nick Tomasheski [AKA Nick Monroe](https://archive.ph/LfbRy#selection-1695.0-1695.43)), a known [Gamergate figurehead](https://medium.com/@TomTom94/press-fart-to-get-banned-on-gamergates-most-retweeted-user-7831fc3e8e9b#.6trow6uec) and alleged serial harasser who has been [at odds even with other notable Gamergate figureheads](http://www.twitlonger.com/show/nh2uij). Gamergate [can't decide what to do](https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/42g0k3/ethics_derekescapistpressfartocontinuelizzy/) with this blatant display of ethics in videogames journalism.
	- With a display of perfect timing, internal Gamergate drama demonstrates its dedication to "ethics in videogames journalism", as Gamergate YouTube channel **BroTeamPill** [publishes the conversations](https://archive.ph/DkpY0) with **Ethan "TheRalphRetort" Ralph**, revealing how Ralph [attempts to undermine other Gamergate news channels](https://archive.ph/66ccI). After threats of [suing BroTeamPill](https://archive.ph/WiNqs), parts of Gamergate [turn against Ralph](https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/4e643/opinionmessage_to_ethan_ralph_stop_becoming_leigh/).
- January 27: **[Richard Dawkins](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Richard_Dawkins "Richard Dawkins"):** "I'm a feminist, but this **Sargon of Akkad** fellow has made an [interesting youtube video](http://web.archive.org/web/20160127095804/https:/twitter.com/richarddawkins/status/692033018970705920) about how Feminism and Islamism are the same thing". Facepalm omnes. He's now [deleted the tweet.](https://twitter.com/RichardDawkins/status/692468079184449536)
- January 31: Gamergate figurehead **Christina Hoff Summers** [posts an image macro](http://archive.ph/q4tJI) of debatable taste, origin and purpose on Twitter. When a reporter from the Vox media group (owner of *Polygon*) calls Summers' posting [a display of "white privilege"](http://archive.ph/rcXxl), [Gamergate rallies on Reddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/43ln0l/matt_yglesias_of_vox_criticizes_christina_hoff/) and [attacks the Vox reporter on Twitter](http://imgur.com/lKRNAKX).

### February 2016

- February 1: U.S. Representative **Katherine Clark**, prominent Gamergate critic, sponsor of the Interstate Swatting Hoax Act, and Representative for Zoe Quinn (initially) and Brianna Wu, [gets swatted herself](http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2016/02/01/cops-swarm-rep-katherine-clark-melrose-home-after-apparent-hoax/yqEpcpWmKtN6bOOAj8FZXJ/story.html).
- February 8: News emerges that **Veerender Jubbal**, a frequent target of Gamergate's attacks, [had to leave Twitter](https://web.archive.org/web/20170222002206/https://storify.com/KivaBay/what-happened-to-veerender), because law enforcement was worried about a possible threat to his life.
- February 9: **Twitter** announces [the formation of a council](https://blog.twitter.com/2016/announcing-the-twitter-trust-safety-council) which is supposed to advise the company on issues of harassment and abuse. One of the 40 organizations represented in the council is **Anita Sarkeesian** 's organization Feminist Frequency. [Gamergate's reaction is predictable](https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/44z682/new_trust_and_safety_council_is_twitter_version/).
- February 10: **Zoe Quinn** [reveals they have dropped criminal harassment charges they had filed against](http://blog.unburntwitch.com/post/139084743809/why-i-just-dropped-the-harassment-charges-the-man) **Eron Gjoni**, stating that they were tired of the prolonged legal battles with their ex. Gjoni stated his appeal of their original restraining order [would still proceed](http://www.dailydot.com/lifestyle/zoe-quinn-harassment-charges-eron-gjoni/).
- February 15: In order to protest the localization of Nintendo's *Fire Emblem Fates*, Gamergate [starts a campaign](http://archive.ph/8N4s7) under the name of #TorrentialDownpour [aimed at Nintendo's localization team](https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/45w5qo/goal_operation_torrential_downpour/) (mostly at **Alison Rapp**). Undeterred by Gamergate's opposition, [the game sells exceptionally well](http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2016/02/fire_emblem_fates_becomes_fastest_selling_release_in_franchise_history_in_the_us).
- February 21: [League of the South](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/League_of_the_South "League of the South") member Robert Stacy McCain is banned from Twitter for harassment. With the [support of various right-wing blogs](http://archive.ph/H8I2Z), Gamergate [lays the blame](https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/46rgnl/predictably_twitter_is_now_banning_anti_feminists/) on **Anita Sarkeesian**, simply because she is a member of Twitter's advisory council (see entry on February 9). Sarkeesian [responds with calling this](http://feministfrequency.com/2016/02/22/on-twitter-conspiracy-theories-and-information-cascades/) a conspiracy theory "as the justification for more extreme forms of harassment".
- February 27: A hitpiece on **Alison Rapp** is published by [neo-nazi website *The Daily Stormer*](http://archive.ph/XiLDJ), adding anti-semitic conspiracy theories to the toxic mix. **Andrew "weev" Auernheimer** [posts a comment featuring contact information for executives at Nintendo](http://archive.ph/XiLDJ#selection-1665.0-1665.4) on Gamergate's behalf.
- February 28: **Jamie Walton**, president and co-founder of a non-profit to end child sex trafficking, [is apparently duped into joining Gamergate's attack](http://archive.ph/htX88) on **Alison Rapp**, as Gamergaters have been accusing her of defending pedophilia over a college essay in which she discussed how Japanese anti-child pornography laws have been influenced by international pressure.
- February 29: Moderators on /r/KotakuInAction [attempt to uphold a facade of credibility](https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/48b46y/industry_alison_rapp_nintendo_treehouse_discusses/) with regards to **Alison Rapp**, while other parts of Gamergate [approve of these tactics](https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/3q4ufe/alison_rapp_an_sjw_and_antigg_who_represents/).

### March 2016

- March 1: **Jamie Walton** [is revealed to have been participating](https://twitter.com/a_man_in_black/status/704898911450865664) in Gamergate's stalking of **Brianna Wu** for a year on the [Kiwi Farms](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Kiwi_Farms "Kiwi Farms") site. Wu [confirms](https://twitter.com/Spacekatgal/status/704903932808712192). Despite some raising doubts about the account belonging to her, [more and more evidence piles up of her having owned the account and using Gamergate to benefit her foundation all while attacking Wu](https://twitter.com/_lifestyled/status/706338409967648768).
	- On March 30, **Jesse Singal** uncovers [this year old tweet](https://twitter.com/jamiewalton/status/562379088699334657) where Walton is victim blaming and sincerely using "SJW" while attacking Wu.
- March 4: ***Kotaku*** [attempts to explain](http://kotaku.com/the-ugly-new-front-in-the-neverending-video-game-cultur-1762942381) how Gamergate's attacks on **Alison Rapp** are par for the course, revealing **Andrew "weev" Aurenheimer** was instrumental in doxing several top Nintendo executives in order to get her fired. Other victims of Gamergate (or "Gamergate Revolt" as Gamergaters like to cast blame elsewhere) in this issue over *Fire Emblem Fates* include actual localization employees at Nintendo (Rapp is a marketing specialist). *Kotaku* even found **Eron Gjoni** realizing how stupid all this shit is.
- March 9: Gamergate member and anti-feminist activist **Lauren Southern** [initiates](http://www.wehuntedthemammoth.com/2016/03/08/internet-jerks-pledge-to-be-extra-jerky-tomorrow-during-thetriggering/) [The Triggering](https://rationalwiki.org/w/index.php?title=The_Triggering&action=edit&redlink=1 "The Triggering (page does not exist)"), an event to oppose International Women's Day. The aim of the campaign is to be [assholes on social media](http://archive.ph/5e5Bf). [Most of Gamergate think that is a great idea](https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/49n587/happening_thetriggering_raise_awareness_about/), even though [parts of Gamergate consider the campaign](https://archive.ph/yaEjp) to be a " [jewish conspiracy](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Jewish_conspiracy "Jewish conspiracy") ".
- March 12:
	- [Gamergate is angry at image hosting company](https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/4a204r/imgur_is_censoring_images_critical_of_black_lives/) **Imgur**, accusing it of censorship of a picture which is allegedly showing counter-protestors at a Donald Trump rally. [The image proving](https://sli.mg/b1pm75) the claimed censorship is [not in the style of Imgur](http://imgur.com/4KphnOB), furthermore it shows a [preview image underlied in yellow](http://imgur.com/ubD5yyb) that has no connection to the content of the image that was supposed to have been censored.
	- The **SXSW** festival [hosts its online harassment summit](http://www.engadget.com/2016/03/12/sxsw-online-harassment-summit/), with talks hosted by U.S. Representative **Katherine Clark**, former Texas State senator and gubernatorial candidate **Wendy Davis**, **Brianna Wu**, **Randi Harper**, and **Katherine Cross**. [SXSW for some reason hosts the event a mile away from the main SXSW venue](http://www.theverge.com/2016/3/13/11215268/sxsw-2016-online-harassment-summit-wendy-davis-katherine-clark), [audience attendance was poor](http://money.cnn.com/2016/03/13/technology/sxsw-2016-online-harassment-summit/), and those who did attend were mostly women, resulting in a lot of preaching to the choir. The festival also unexpectedly cancelled a live stream of Harper's panel, which was one of the panels originally cancelled due to the threats of violence months earlier.
- March 15: "SavePoint: A Discussion on the Gaming Community", the Trojan horse Gamergate panel, [is held at SXSW](http://schedule.sxsw.com/2016/events/event_PP57734). Panelists are SPJ President-Elect Lynn Walsh, known Gamergate harasser Nick Robalik of the Pixel Metal video game studio, and Perry Jones who founded **The Open Gaming Society**, the group serving as a front for Gamergate. Gamergate's official porn star **Mercedes Carrera** was also slated to be a panelist, but withdrew at the last minute after SXSW staff asked her to remove [tweets](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CdkqxQAWAAAhWed.jpg) [insulting](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CdkqxQ-WEAAvOb0.jpg) [Harper](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CdkqxQJWIAQyOpr.jpg). How ethical.
- March 16:
	- In the wake of the **SXSW** conference U.S. President **Barack Obama** [speaks out and condemns online harassment against women](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vihEwh8E6VQ&t=48m45s) and advocates the recruitment of more women in tech and proving the collusion goes all the way to the top. [Gamergate is not amused](https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/4atrg9/president_obama_4846_mentions_sxsw_panels_we_know/).
	- **Brianna Wu** is featured in an episode of the Syfy documentary series [*The Internet Ruined My Life*](http://www.syfy.com/theinternetruinedmylife/episodes/season/1/episode/2/food-fight), discussing the origins of her harassment at the hands of Gamergaters. After the episode's broadcast and Gamergate's response to it, [she reports that Gamergaters prove everything she said during the interviews she gave Syfy](https://twitter.com/Spacekatgal/status/710337109337354240).
- March 17: Gamergate figurehead **Mundane Matt** gets swatted. Although the perpetrator(s) is unknown, Mundane Matt [said in his video about the ordeal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygEV5TDCwms) and in an [interview with the local news](http://www.kptv.com/story/31491363/swatting-prank-scares-beaverton-man) that while he had no idea who had done it to him, he believed it could have been an "enemy" of his he had been arguing with on Twitter earlier that day seeking to frighten him so that he stops making YouTube videos. He also said he had forewarned the police that a swatting could happen to him someday, perhaps because swatting is a tactic used against Gamergate's targets and he became paranoid he'd anger them and gain their hatred. (He that lieth down with dogs shall rise up with fleas.)
- March 18: Hulk Hogan wins his case against Gawker. As mentioned above, this has nothing to do with Gamergate (except for their hatred with one of its subsidiaries), but they [claim credit anyway](http://www.wehuntedthemammoth.com/2016/03/19/gamergaters-claim-credit-for-hulk-hogans-victory-over-gawker-recommend-suicide-to-gawkerites/).
- March 27: *Dead or Alive Xtreme 3* is released and panned by pretty much all Western critics, [even those favorable to Gamergate's party line](http://gameranx.com/features/id/46382/article/dead-or-alive-xtreme-3-review-dead-on-arrival/). Gamergaters [single out the reviewer for *Destructoid*](https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/4c4skc/destructoid_writer_jed_whitaker_has_a_meltdown_on/) and direct [their outrage his way](https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/4c4clr/lewdgamers_article_on_dead_or_alive_xtreme_3_hits/). Minor subreddit /r/GGforAll goes so far as [to dox the writer](http://archive.ph/fn9tY#selection-3247.0-3255.40) and openly advocates [to abuse him on Twitter](http://archive.ph/fn9tY).
- March 28:
	- **Davis Aurini** [finally releases](http://www.staresattheworld.com/2016/03/immersed-subversion-control-culture-control-man-anita-sarkeesian-documentary/) to YouTube [*Immersed in Subversion: Control the Culture, Control the Man (Davis Aurini's Sarkeesian Documentary)*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTcYLPGoC4I&feature=youtu.be), which is *totally* not *The Sarkeesian Effect* or a version of it, although it uses footage filmed for it (*i.e.*, all the Aurini footage **Jordan Owen** cut out of his version). He still doesn't know how to record sound properly.
	- **Blizzard** [responds to beta tester feedback concerning a pose made by the character "Tracer" in their upcoming game *Overwatch*](http://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20743015583?page=11#post-210), agreeing with the poster on the issue of the pose being over-sexualized and not fitting the character's in-game story, and that they had considered changing it as well. [Gamergate goes mad](https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/4cbilp/censorship_overwatch_has_already_given_in_to_sjws/), claiming that Blizzard has "given in to the SJWs", calls it censorship, and instantly [targets the person](https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/4cf5ji/censorship_imc_the_social_justice_crybully_who/) who made the first negative comment. That single character pose instantly becomes Gamergate's [most important topic](http://archive.ph/g3ga9). #ButtGate begins.
- March 29: The hit piece on Cloud Imperium Games (developer of *Star Citizen*) released on **[The Escapist](https://archive.ph/pYhrP)** in September 2015 wins third place at the [SPJ's Kunkel Award for Excellence in News Reporting](http://www.spj.org/kunkel-winners.asp#NewsReporting). The site also lists the criteria for its judgments.
- March 30: **Alison Rapp** announces that [Nintendo of America has fired her](https://twitter.com/alisonrapp/status/715287409424871424) as a result of Gamergate's harassment towards her. In a statement to IGN, [NoA claims that Rapp was terminated for having a second job](http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/31/nintendo-terminates-fire-emblem-fates-spokesperson), which [Rapp (probably unwisely) confirmed](https://twitter.com/alisonrapp/status/715362489441984512), but also claimed was [perfectly kosher under NoA policy](https://twitter.com/alisonrapp/status/715362408227713025). Gamergate couldn't stop [gloating for days](https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/4cph1g/alison_rapp_megathread/).

### April 2016

- April 2: After a writer for game developer **Beamdog** mentions [a new approach to writing](http://kotaku.com/the-struggle-to-bring-back-baldur-s-gate-after-17-years-1768303595) in the upcoming expansion of the revered *Baldur's Gate* franchise, [Gamergate decides to whip itself into a frenzy](https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/4d20ju/amber_scott_writer_for_new_baldurs_gate_claims/) over this minor issue and [targets the writer of the game](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CfOuM4xW4AIT6O0.jpg). Soon Gamergate [is accused of heavily brigading](https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/4d9am6/please_stop_brigading_rbaldursgate/) the relevant communities and the Steam reviews of the game, up until the point that the founder of Beamdog [begs the game's community](https://archive.ph/x54kQ) to counter Gamergate's toxic influence.
- April 3: **Davis Aurini** admits that [he has never actually watched any of Anita Sarkeesian's videos](http://www.wehuntedthemammoth.com/2016/04/03/davis-aurini-admits-he-never-actually-watched-any-of-anita-sarkeesians-videos/) despite having spent a year and a half and thousands of donated dollars making a film about her. This surprises no one.
- April 5: In response to earlier criticisms, **Blizzard** patches in a [new pose for the character Tracer](http://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2016/04/06/blizzard-patches-in-brilliant-tracer-pose-compromise-new-skins-to-overwatch/#69c1e8a32ab6) in their game *Overwatch*. Despite being a good compromise, [Gamergate still claims victory while simultaneously wishing that the old pose was still available](https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/4dj35s/tracers_new_pose_added_to_overwatch_i_am_starting/).
- April 6: After Gamergate [keeps on pressuring](https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/4dbexe/report_beamdog_banning_critics_of_founders_call/) **Beamdog**, CEO Trent Oster [releases a statement](https://forums.beamdog.com/discussion/51165/beamdogs-official-statement-4-6-2016) that they won't cave to the pressure of threats and "stand behind all our developers 100%", but does admit that the NPC causing much of the controversy could've been written better and announced that a joke line from a character about "ethics in heroic adventuring" would be removed. Gamergate considers [this to be a victory](http://archive.ph/ycbaZ). Meanwhile [veterans of the *Dungeons & Dragons* RPG](http://imgur.com/881PdBQ), as well as [members of the official *D&D* team](http://archive.ph/vNtpl) openly support Beamdog, and even Gamergate's birth place, 4chan, [gets sick of the drama](https://archive.ph/LTGu6).
- April 9: Not content with *just* getting **Alison Rapp** fired from her job at Nintendo, Gamergate continues to target her and finds what they claim to be her listing on an escorting website, allegedly the "moonlighting" that Nintendo fired her over. Gamergate immediately begins spreading the nude photos of the escort they had found, *because of course they would*, and [post many threads about it on /r/KotakuInAction](https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/4e4598/discussion_drama_it_is_confirmed_that_alison_rapp/). The moderators begin deleting threads and [banning people](https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/4e4598/discussion_drama_it_is_confirmed_that_alison_rapp/d1wug4m) for sharing anything regarding this renewed attempt to completely ruin a woman's life, which is of course just to save face on Reddit because every other Gamergate meeting place doesn't care about their public image.
- April 10: Gamergate smells blood in the water and continues their onslaught against **Alison Rapp** and [begins to dox her family members](https://twitter.com/alisonrapp/status/719309949923274752). Rapp says [her sister and a friend's employer were contacted](https://twitter.com/alisonrapp/status/719332150068137984), and said that her family [has begun deleting their web presence and issued warnings to their employers](https://twitter.com/alisonrapp/status/719323394848608257) in hopes of mitigating Gamergate harassment.
- April 13: A Kickstarter is opened for a website called Social Autopsy, allegedly to combat online harassment by cataloguing people's actions. The [campaign is shut down by Kickstarter a day later](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1968200734/wave-goodbye-to-cyberbullies-and-trolls-socialauto/description) as it is clearly set up to be a doxing database.
- April 15: **Randi Harper** takes the Social Autopsy [group to task](https://medium.com/@randileeharper/an-open-letter-to-social-autopsy-ae64fccdcfe#.ycmmiehem), calling them out on attacking **Zoe Quinn** when Quinn spoke to them on the phone as Quinn broke down in tears during the call ([the Social Autopsy's since deleted tweets about the phone call](http://imgur.com/a/BXdLA), note them talking to **Cathy Young** of all people). The Social Autopsy team leader [Candace Owens](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Candace_Owens "Candace Owens") decides the next course of action is to [talk to](https://twitter.com/socialcoroner/status/721195801779810305) **Ethan "TheRalphRetort" Ralph**. Ralph seems to have convinced them of the Gamergate party line.
- April 16: **[Candace Owens](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Candace_Owens "Candace Owens")**, head of Social Autopsy, [begins to openly side with Gamergate](https://twitter.com/iglvzx/status/721458682026807296). Even MRA figurehead and Gamergate supporter **Paul Elam** [wants to get in touch with her now](https://twitter.com/AVoiceforMen/status/721459912811749376). Thus Gamergate [rethinks its position](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CgMi2DCUIAAccWi.jpg:orig) towards the site, hoping [to use it against its targets](https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/4f54qh/).
- April 18: **Jesse Singal** [covers](http://nymag.com/following/2016/04/how-social-autopsy-fell-for-gamergate-trutherism.html) how **Candace Owens** fell into the Gamergate conspiracy theory hole because she has no idea how the Internet works when it comes to going viral and when it comes to online abuse. As Owens threatened to post an "exposé", before Singal published his piece [he contacts her about it and warns her that her post is a bad idea](https://twitter.com/jessesingal/status/722164479367258112). Owens ignores Singal and [confirms all of his theories about her state of mind on her company's blog hours later](http://degree180.com/8686-2/).
- April 24: **Candace Owens** of Social Autopsy [lashes out](http://www.wehuntedthemammoth.com/2016/04/25/in-furious-post-socialautopsys-candace-owens-attacks-a-washpo-story-that-isnt-there/) at Caitlin Dewey and David Malitz of *The Washington Post* after Dewey interviewed her and tried to corroborate part of her story and uncovered a lie. Owens' attempts at "preventing libel" results in siccing her thousands of Twitter followers on Dewey while she is at a family affair and later Malitz (Dewey's editor) killing the story because Social Autopsy is not newsworthy enough, while also defending his reporter's ethics. Owens is still furious, believing that everyone involved is in the pockets of Amazon.com and places Jeff Bezos at the top of her conspiracy theory pyramid featuring Zoe Quinn, Randi Harper, Jesse Singal, and now *The Washington Post*.
- April 26: **Candace Owens** tries in vain to get "#journalgate" to trend in response to her "mistreatment" (translation: actual ethical reporting) at the hands of Jesse Singal and Caitlin Dewey.

### May 2016

- May 19: **Eron Gjoni** 's appeal against **Zoe Quinn** 's ***vacated*** restraining order [is denied on all grounds](http://blog.unburntwitch.com/post/144635493954/i-won). [The court found](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bw9TlqTh1_29elJ3dEtaV3JrOFU/view) the "deluge of harassment" to be "uncontested".
- May 26: After an appearance of Breitbart Tech editor **Milo Yiannopoulos** at DePaul University [gets disrupted by activists of the "Black Lives Matter" movement](http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2016/05/25/depaul-president-apologizes-after-conservative-forum-disrupted-by-protesters/), Gamergate and various subreddits linked to Donald Trump [dox one of the protestors](https://np.reddit.com/r/AgainstHateSubreddits/comments/4l0v0m/here_are_posts_currently_up_giving_the_real_name/).

### June 2016

- June 22: **Zoe Quinn** [expresses disdain towards a few lines from *Paper Mario: Color Splash*](https://web.archive.org/web/20160622204108/https:/twitter.com/unburntwitch/status/745714046511394816) that Quinn feel are jabs against them. Quinn, and others, construe the "Five Fun Guys" and "Shufflegate" dialog as references to their early harassment at the hands of Gamergate. Quinn gets told that the localization references the more famous [Watergate](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Watergate "Watergate") scandal.
	- *Giant Bomb* 's Austin Walker [discusses how even if it is a coincidence that does not mean Quinn is wrong in how they reacted because negligence isn't an excuse for having caused harm](https://twitter.com/austin_walker/status/745730438031904768).
- June 23: Nintendo [issues a public statement](http://kotaku.com/after-outcry-nintendo-says-paper-mario-color-splash-d-1782492966) that the entire scene the lines are from are indeed references to the Watergate scandal and not "...a crude reference to an online hate campaign". This marks the first time that a major video game company calls out Gamergate for being a hate campaign.

### July 2016

- July 20: **Milo Yiannopoulos** is [banned from Twitter](http://www.theverge.com/2016/7/19/12232738/twitter-bans-milo-yiannopoulos) on the grounds that he was inciting his followers into sending [*Ghostbusters*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghostbusters_\(2016_film\) "wp:Ghostbusters (2016 film)") actress [Leslie Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Jones "wp:Leslie Jones") a deluge of racist harassment by repeatedly tweeting insults at her and sharing fake tweets of her making bigoted remarks. As usual, multiple people fake Tweets after the fact implying it was a false flag or falsely accuse several Gamergate targets as perpetrators. Because it's actually about ethics in how busting makes you feel good.
- July 21: **Zoe Quinn** [announces](https://twitter.com/UnburntWitch/status/756200380141142016) that **Eron Gjoni** had tried to appeal his restraining order, which Quinn had initially placed on him but since vacated, to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court after being rejected at a lower appeals court. The SJC also rejected his appeal, ensuring that Commonwealth of Massachusetts law allows domestic violence victims to modify their restraining orders should the original restrictions cause more harm than good. Quinn then assures their followers that they will return to work on " [the finest vampire night bus smut fanfic game ever made](https://twitter.com/UnburntWitch/status/756206659991576576) ".

### August 2016

- August 15: Cathy Young commemorates the second anniversary of Gamergate by posting a link on Twitter to an interview with Eron Gjoni she wrote for Heat Street, in which she gets Gjoni to admit that if he had to do the Zoe post all over again, he would. [\[2\]](https://twitter.com/cathyyoung63/status/765259407764647936?lang=en)
- August 19: **Max Read**, the former editor-in-chief of **Gawker**, publishes his piece " [Did I Kill Gawker?](http://nymag.com/selectall/2016/08/did-i-kill-gawker.html)" where he names a total of six parties that he argues to have played a role in the later demise of Gawker — listing GamerGate as one of them. Regarding the fatal inaccuracy of GamerGate's initial premises (Zoe Quinn's alleged "sex-bought game review"), he stated;

> That no such review ever actually appeared on \[Kotaku\] should tell you a lot about Gamergate’s relationship to the truth; that Gamergaters believe this is how sex works should tell you a lot about the Gamergate demographic. But none of the specifics of the story really mattered, because ultimately Kotaku was being targeted less for specific ethical violations than for its critical coverage of the portrayal of women and minorities in video games and the sexism of the gaming community.

### September 2016

- September 7: **Ethan Ralph**, publisher of the [Rush Limbaugh](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Rush_Limbaugh "Rush Limbaugh") -esque ***The Ralph Retort***, is [arrested on two counts of assault on law enforcement and one count of obstruction of justice](http://www.businessinsider.com/ethan-ralph-gamergate-leader-arrested-2016-9?r=US&IR=T&IR=T).

### December 2016

- December 6: A Freedom of Information act request to the **FBI** is fulfilled, resulting in pages of investigatory notes regarding Gamergater harassment and threats. Many pages are redacted per court orders.
