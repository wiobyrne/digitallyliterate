In collaboration with a global network, we co-create public interventions, exhibitions, resources, and training programs to:

Promote Critical thinking We foster critical conversations about technologies' impacts on society and the environment.

Build the capacity of individuals and communities We advance civil society skills and create spaces for exchange and collaboration.

Foster understanding and knowledge We conduct research and advance knowledge on the intersection of technology, power and crises.

	### AI & Us
	](https://tacticaltech.org/AI-work/)
	Now more than ever, we need to be ready to understand and navigate the impacts of generative technologies. Through immersive activations, toolkits, guides, and training programs, we empower individuals, communities, and organizations to understand and respond to the landscape of challenges and opportunities created by AI and AI-powered tools, while fostering critical reflection.

	### Digital Technologies & Climate
	](https://tacticaltech.org/digital-technologies-and-climate/)
	Digital technologies impact the environment, but also shape the way society understands and responds to the climate crisis. Increasingly, actors work with data-driven technologies to set narratives that sometimes spread confusion. We advance knowledge and build the capacity of professionals and decision-makers to understand and respond to this influence in the industry through training, residencies, masterclasses, and toolkits.

	### Misinformation & Information Integrity
	The spread of misinformation impacts society's opinions, decisions, and civic participation while amplifying polarization and societal tensions. Through creative activations, resources, toolkits, guides, and training programs, we build the capacity of individuals, communities, and organizations to understand how misinformation spreads and how they can take action to tackle its spread.
