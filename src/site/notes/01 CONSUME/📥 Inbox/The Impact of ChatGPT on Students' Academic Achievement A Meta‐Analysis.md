### ABSTRACT

### Background

ChatGPT, a generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) chatbot, has gained significant traction as a tool for supporting students learning. Despite its growing popularity, there is still no academic consensus on its effectiveness in enhancing students' academic achievement.

### Objectives

This study aims to explore the effect of ChatGPT on students' academic achievement through a meta-analysis. It seeks to identify the overall effect size and examine variations based on moderators such as educational level, discipline, intervention duration, sample size, knowledge type, instructional model, role-setting, learning approach, and generated content.

### Methods

A meta-analysis was conducted on 37 studies (comprising 37 effect sizes) published between 2022 and 2025. The studies were analysed to calculate the overall effect size (Hedges' *g*) and to explore subgroup differences.

### Results and Conclusion

The findings reveal that ChatGPT has a moderately positive impact on students' academic achievement, with an overall effect size of *g*  = 0.577 (95% CI \[0.395, 0.759\], *p*  < 0.001). Further analysis of moderating variables indicates that no significant differences are observed across educational levels, role-setting, or learning approaches. A greater effect is observed in the social sciences compared to other disciplines; an intervention duration of 5–10 weeks has a larger impact on academic achievement compared to other durations; sample sizes ranging from 21 to 40 participants exhibit a larger impact on academic achievement than other sample sizes; ChatGPT is more effective in supporting the learning of declarative knowledge compared to procedural knowledge; the combination of traditional classrooms with ChatGPT is more effective than using ChatGPT in a flipped classroom; compared to generating code, using ChatGPT to generate text has better academic achievement.
