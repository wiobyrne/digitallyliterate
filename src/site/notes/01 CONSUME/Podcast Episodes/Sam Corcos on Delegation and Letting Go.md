### ‚ú® Summary
The speaker emphasized the importance of delegation and shared a personal experience of hiring an EA after realizing the need for developing the skill. The decision was influenced by a desire to achieve an ambitious yet achievable goal of creating a comprehensive tactical guide to delegation. This journey began by posting an ad on Craigslist with no predetermined tasks, eventually leading to the hiring of Lori, who has been with the speaker for 10 years.

<blockquote><b>Tim Ferriss</b><br/><br/>I've been looking forward to this because I know how organized and systematic you are. And for people who didn't see what came before this, I asked you, as I asked many of my guests, what would make this a home run or time well spent? And you said, well, I know that is one of the questions you like to ask based on my research. So let me open my notebook and you had answers. And one of them that we can mention is an ambitious goal, but I think it's an achievable goal, which is to make this one of the most comprehensive tactical guides to delegation. And within that, there'll be a lot of process and I have a lot to learn. Let's begin at the beginning. When did you start taking delegation seriously?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Sam Corcos</b><br/><br/>Well, so true story. It came from reading your book almost exactly 10 years ago. And I posted an ad in Craigslist for an EA. I had nothing for her to do. I just knew from reading your book that this is a skill that I need to develop. I ended up hiring Lori, who's been working with me now for 10 years. She showed up. I thought,</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
Rematching in delegation involves finding a more suitable match for a role, which can significantly improve productivity and reduce stress. It is crucial not to generalize from one bad experience as a good match can make a substantial difference. Overcoming imposter syndrome is key in delegation; reframing the perspective on delegating tasks can enable better delegation and productivity.

<blockquote><b>Sam Corcos</b><br/><br/>Maybe we'll find somebody who had a legal background in the Philippines.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Tim Ferriss</b><br/><br/>So rematch, just so I'm clear on terms, doesn't mean that you're matching that person with another person in the organization. It means let's find an alternate option.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Sam Corcos</b><br/><br/>Let's just find a different person to be your EA. A whole new process, different people, different background. And then the second time around, it was night and day difference. She understood all the terminology, and his output easily doubled, and his stress levels just really dropped. He was able to manage his time, had way more time for deep work, and it really just improved his satisfaction. So I would say that's a big one is just don't, if you have one bad experience, don't assume that you can't have a good one. Other reasons, one is imposter syndrome is another one. I'm reminded of a recent conversation I had where somebody was struggling to delegate and one of the things they said is, well, who am I to tell them to do this task that I don't want to do? And I find reframing is usually a good way to do it.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
The strongly recommended reading list for employees at the company includes 'No Rules Rules' on Netflix culture, '15 Commitments of Conscious Leadership', and 'Nonviolent Communication', which is suggested for all humans. For EAs, although there is no required reading list, it is beneficial for them to read the same recommended books. 'Nonviolent Communication' can be challenging due to its title, as it focuses on non-threatening communication to avoid triggering fight or flight responses during conversations.

<blockquote><b>Tim Ferriss</b><br/><br/>There any, we're going to bounce around a lot, and we are going to zoom out to the company level in a second. But read these books. Are there any books that you strongly recommend or require as reading for two groups? People in the company, so employees, and then EAs of people who work in the company, or your EAs?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Sam Corcos</b><br/><br/>We don't have a required reading list for the EAs. We have a strongly recommended reading list for a lot of people at the company. What does the strongly recommended reading list look like? So we actually, we have a team book club every month where we read these books and we've been around long enough to where we've recycled some of them and they've come back up. Some that really come up a lot are No Rules Rules, which is the book on Netflix culture. 15 Commitments of Conscious Leadership is another one, which I know you're familiar with. Yes, indeed. Another one that I know you're familiar with is Nonviolent Communication, which really should just be required reading for all people. For all humans. Yeah. I have found one sticking point with that book is the title. I recommended it to a friend who had the exact situation that this book was meant to solve. And he said, well, the problem I'm dealing with doesn't involve any violence. It's like, no, no, no, it's not the point. It's really, it's about non-threatening communication.

### ‚ú® Summary
A Loom was shared externally from a 40-50 person team's Friday forum, which serves as their team all-hands meeting. The team members usually attend the meeting live, and some watch the recordings later. Additionally, the team uses Notion for memos, where each memo includes a summary Loom at the top. These summary Looms provide a five-minute walkthrough of important topics, allowing team members to easily share and consume information.

The loom that was shared was one of our Friday forums. What is a Friday forum? Oh, sorry, that's our team all hands. We do it every week on Fridays. How large is the team now? The team's 40, 50 people. 40, 50 people. And so many people show up live, so they don't watch the recording. So that's fine. And then some people watch it after the fact. We also have a number of all of our memos. We also use Notion pretty religiously. Once you learn how to use the Notion database features, they're actually extremely powerful in the amount of leverage you can get from it. All of our memos have a summary loom at the top, any sort of meaningful memo. And so somebody will do a five-minute walkthrough of something that they wrote, and many people just watch those looms. So it's another thing where people can share.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Tim Ferriss</b><br/><br/>What is the format or the agenda for the</blockquote>

### [49:10] Tech workers' compulsive need to check Slack and the impact on productivity

### ‚ú® Summary
Tech workers often feel compelled to check Slack frequently due to the constant influx of information, leading to decreased productivity. Studies show that most tech workers cannot go more than six minutes without checking their communication tools like Slack. This compulsive behavior interrupts tasks such as coding and creates a distraction. Creating boundaries such as adopting a 'low information diet' or practicing 'new sobriety' can help in managing the overwhelming information flow and improving day-to-day productivity.

### ‚ú® Summary
The company emphasizes the importance of the onboarding process, providing a detailed checklist for new employees to follow daily. All employees, not just specific roles, must adhere to the onboarding process, which includes tasks assigned for a full month. The company expects employees not to start producing work until after the onboarding period, as it takes time for individuals to fully understand the unique company culture and operational methods.

Really take onboarding seriously. Our onboarding process is a full month, and we don't expect people to start producing for a month. It really does take that long for a lot of people to get fully up to speed, and we help guide them in more slowly. Read these books.

### [01:08:27] Ability to blur or crop sensitive information in loom recordings


[üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (01:07:06 - 01:08:33)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/aa97a509-0d90-44ad-ab68-e8ae5e8f0e76)

### ‚ú® Summary
Loom has the ability to blur or crop sensitive information in recordings using its editing features. This capability is useful for maintaining privacy and security, especially when sharing recordings with external parties or discussing sensitive information within a team. If needed, sensitive information can be blurred out or edited externally as well. The option to edit recordings ensures that users can confidently share content without compromising the privacy of individuals or third parties involved.

<blockquote><b>Sam Corcos</b><br/><br/>A technical question.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Tim Ferriss</b><br/><br/>Can you blur if, for instance, I've had this experience where I record a loom, it's a really good loom for an external party. And then I noticed like, ah, shit, like I have a tab or something open that displays some sensitive or like my iMessage is off to the side, but I did a full screen recording, and it's like, I don't want to compromise the people I'm communicating with in that way.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Sam Corcos</b><br/><br/>Do you have the ability to blur or crop or anything like that? You can edit within Loom. I think they might have introduced a blur feature somewhat recently. Yeah, or just a cropping capability. Yeah. I have to check. That would be very useful. Yeah, they might have it because they have an editor within it. If not, there's definitely, like our EAs do this already. For our Friday forums, we sometimes have sensitive information in there that we don't want to share publicly. Sometimes it's, the most common one is something related to a third party that they don't want shared. And so we still talk about it as a team, but then we cut the audio for that part and we blur out anything written about it. And so there's definitely a capability to do it. It's either done in Loom or it's done externally, but it's not that hard.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Tim Ferriss</b><br/><br/>Okay. We are going to weave back to Calendly because we were kind of joking slash seriously discussing how a lot of people get offended with this tool, but that is the micro level.

### [01:10:36] Managing Time Constraints and To-Do Lists


[üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (01:09:20 - 01:10:40)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/4bac5253-3224-4165-8c90-db18d55dec95)

### ‚ú® Summary
When managing time constraints and to-do lists, it is essential to transfer tasks from the to-do list to the calendar with the estimated time required for completion. This practice helps individuals realize the actual availability of time and the need to allocate specific durations for each task. Understanding that time is finite, and tasks are endless, highlights the importance of setting realistic expectations and incorporating buffer time in the schedule to accommodate unexpected events. Allocating about 50% slack time in a day is recommended to handle unforeseen circumstances effectively.

<blockquote><b>Sam Corcos</b><br/><br/>I've worked with a lot of people on our team, people who are friends of mine through this. And the thing that almost always happens is they have this long to-do list and I say, all right, here's what I want you to do. Take everything on this to-do list with the dates that you think they'll get done by, which is usually this week or next week. And I want you to just put them on your calendar with the amount of time you think it's going to take. And then we'll have another follow-up call next week, and we'll see what happens. And then we have the call. And then they say, this process doesn't work. I say, why is that? I said, well, I tried to move it over there, but there isn't enough space in my week to fit all these items. It's like, yes. That's the point of the exercise. There literally is not enough time. Your time is finite, and the number of digital items you can add to a to-do list is infinite. You are working with the wrong constraint, which is like the amount of items you can fit in a database row, as opposed to the number of things that you can fit in your finite time of your Calendar. And so we then work on, all right, you probably need Slack during the course of the day. Usually like 50% is a good target because things come up. Oh, I see. Not the tool Slack, but space, extra space. You need extra space in the day.

### ‚ú® Summary
Utilize email directly as a to-do list by determining the time needed to respond to each email and scheduling specific time blocks in your calendar for responses. By assigning dedicated time slots to emails based on their required effort, you prevent the anxiety-inducing stack of unsorted tasks in your inbox, making it easier to manage and prioritize your workload effectively.

So when I get a new task, a lot of my tasks effectively come in through email. So I'll get an email. And this is also another thing that I worked with a couple of people on who really, really struggled with email. And the thing they struggle with is using their email as a to-do list which is a very common thing that people do the problem it creates a lot of anxiety when you have this stack of uncategorized Things it could be 15 minutes it could be 50 hours you have no idea until you open up each one individually to figure out how much work it is and so the same process of translating your to-do List into your calendar you can do the same thing with email, which is I worked with somebody recently where I said, all right, let's open each email. How long is this going to take you to respond to? These are like the chunkier ones. It's like 30 minutes. Great. Market is done. Copy the link and put that link in your calendar. So you're going to spend this 30-minute block responding to this email. What's the next one? That's going to take me a full hour because I have to write something for them. That's interesting.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Tim Ferriss</b><br/><br/>So the clearing of the inbox then is really, in some capacity, scheduling the proper amount of time to reply to these things.

### [01:49:45] Course Correcting and Priorities: Aligning Values with Actions


[üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (01:48:23 - 01:49:48)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/9c283a27-1a10-4245-8f40-131603b0289b)

### ‚ú® Summary
Aligning values with actions involves course correcting by assessing how time is spent in alignment with stated values. Merely having awareness of values is insufficient; true alignment is reflected in how time is allocated. Despite identifying values like friends and family, true priorities are revealed in daily activities such as consuming news or engaging in sports. The discrepancy between stated values and actual actions mirrors an epistemological challenge, emphasizing that one's actions define who they are. Therefore, to ensure alignment, individuals must scrutinize how their time is truly spent in relation to their professed values.

Are there certain tasks or types of work or interactions that you just categorically do not engage with now? Are there kind of no categories for you? It's more that having the awareness.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Sam Corcos</b><br/><br/>I was talking to somebody recently about this where we did a values exercise and they came up with a set of values that they have. And then it's a bit of a trick question because then you say, all right, let's go over your calendar and how you spent your time. And they'll say, oh, my values are friends, family, this, that. And it's like, oh, how'd you spend your time? Like YouTube, Instagram. Do you notice how none of these things match? Like your actual priorities are consuming news. Your actual priority is doing sports, which is fine. There's nothing wrong with that. But empirically, your priorities are this. How you spend your time are your priorities. And that's a difficult thing for people to understand. But it really is like an epistemological problem where the example would be if you're an axe murderer, but you go your whole life and you never murder someone with an axe, are you actually An axe murderer? The act is what makes you what you are. Yeah. I think this is a Ben Horowitz's book. Like what you do is who you are. That is what it is. How you spend your</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
For his sabbatical, he chose to study theology and network theory. The reason behind selecting these two subjects was to delve into deeper topics. Network theory, he explained, is about understanding relationships and connections between entities. It helped him comprehend the intricacies of interconnected systems. Through his sabbatical, he upgraded his knowledge in areas such as AI, which had seen significant advancements over the years. He also mentioned using fast AI course to create a project that could recognize images of cats.

<blockquote><b>Tim Ferriss</b><br/><br/>Next, I would like to chat about your sabbatical briefly. And that may not be the term that you would apply, but you took a year off after your last company and you studied two things, theology and network theory. Why did you choose these two? And I understand these words separately, but honestly, I have no idea what network theory refers to. So how do you choose these two? And then could you please explain network theory and what has come of that?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Sam Corcos</b><br/><br/>I had a whole list of topics. Some of them ended up being much simpler or more shallow than I was expecting. One that was simpler, I had on my list of things. Bigger calves.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Tim Ferriss</b><br/><br/>How can I get bigger calves?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Sam Corcos</b><br/><br/>One of them was getting up to speed on the state of AI. This was five years ago now. And the last time I had done it was maybe 10 years ago. And it was really hard. There were no libraries. There was no real tooling. And then next time I get into it, a friend recommended the fast AI course. And it was so easy. My goal was to create something that can recognize images of cats.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
The speaker discusses the impact of network theory on their understanding of religion. They highlight the recognition of the separation between community, ritual, and spiritual beliefs within religion. This insight led to a salon dinner where the speaker realized similarities to William James' 'Varieties of Religious Experience'. The study prompted a shift in perspective and a deeper contemplation of the different facets of religion.

### ‚ú® Summary
The insight from the snip revolves around the recognition of the separation between the community, rituals, and superficial aspects of religion from the deep spiritual beliefs underlying it. It highlights the realization that the distinction between the two aspects has been a known concept for a long time, such as discussed in 'Varieties of Religious Experience' by William James. The discussion also touches on the appreciation and respect for the positive impacts of religion on individuals. Furthermore, the deep dive into epistemology prompts the acknowledgment that all truth is subjective, with no existence of objective truth unless one believes in a higher power. The speaker expresses concern about the path towards postmodernism and complete moral relativism, emphasizing the importance of finding a balance between individual truths and a common moral ground to avoid negative consequences.

And he explained it. It's like, yeah, it's exactly the same thing. And he wrote about this more than a hundred years ago. I thought I had this unique insight. And it's something that's been known for a long time. I would say one of the things that came out of it more than anything was an appreciation and a deeper respect for the positive aspects of religion and what it does for people. I think the deep dive into epistemology also was pretty mind-bending, where it caused me to recognize that this is actually something that I'm still wrestling with, is that I really Do not believe there is such a thing as objective truth. All truth is subjective. You can maybe asymptotically approach truth, but there is no such thing as objective truth. The only way to believe in that is to believe in some specific higher power. Where I struggle with it is that that path almost always leads to postmodernism and to really bad things. And so I struggle.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Tim Ferriss</b><br/><br/>Can you define just, what do you mean by postmodernism here?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Sam Corcos</b><br/><br/>Postmodernism meaning like your truth is just as valid as anyone else's truth. Just like complete moral relativism. 100% moral relativism is exactly, it is postmodernism in a nutshell. It's like your truth is just as important and real as anybody else's. There is no truth. There is no commons that we can agree on. It's just purely individual truth is all that matters. That leads to bad outcomes.</blockquote>

### [02:24:59] Postmodernism and the Dangers of Moral Relativism

### ‚ú® Summary
Postmodernism promotes the idea of complete moral relativism where individual truths are as valid as any other, rejecting the existence of a common truth. This belief system, often observed in societies with postmodernist views like Marxism, tends to lead to negative outcomes. The prevalence of postmodernist beliefs in social media and the spread of disinformation has contributed to a state where people struggle to discern reality, leading some to nihilism.

And some people certainly then kind of bleed over nihilism for a lot of other reasons.</blockquote>

### [02:30:30] Understanding the Value of Relationships in Network Theory


[üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (02:29:09 - 02:30:32)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/c6f4db2a-0325-4101-a3ad-24992481a7c9)

### ‚ú® Summary
Recognizing the value of relationships entails curating connections with mutual interest and understanding changing priorities in relationships without taking it personally. Network theory emphasizes the significance of relationships based on different forms of value - be it personal or professional. One crucial aspect is eigenvector centrality, highlighted in Paul Granovetter's 'The Strength of Weak Ties,' which underscores the importance of weak ties in networks, indicating that acquaintances are often more valuable in facilitating opportunities than close relationships.

<blockquote><b>Sam Corcos</b><br/><br/>Yeah, yeah. And so at some point, I realized, you know, I'm just going to change my list. I'm only going to have people on here who I think also want to spend time with me. So it's in both directions. And so if I keep reaching out and they keep canceling or ignoring, it's like, that's fine. I don't take it personally anymore. It's just they maybe have kids now. They have different life priorities. It's 100% okay. And maybe in five years, we can be friends again. It's not a big deal. I used to take these things a lot more personally, and I just don't anymore. And so network theory is really understanding why some of these relationships are more valuable in whatever way you choose to describe value. Is it professionally valuable? Is it personally valuable? Whatever the thing is. And there are several categories that are especially relevant for interpersonal human networks. One that is, it's a really underappreciated form of network centralities. It was called eigenvector centrality. There's a famous paper by Paul Granovetter, I think written in the 70s, called The Strength of Weak Ties. Cool title. Yeah, it's a very important paper in network theory, which it talks about how much more important weak ties are than strong ties. How you are more likely to find your next job from somebody who is an acquaintance rather than a friend.</blockquote>
