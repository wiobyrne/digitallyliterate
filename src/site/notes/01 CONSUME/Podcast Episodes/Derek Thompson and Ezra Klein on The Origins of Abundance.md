# Derek Thompson and Ezra Klein on The Origins of Abundance


![Cover|200](https://wsrv.nl/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimage.simplecastcdn.com%2Fimages%2F52528093-7778-44d3-b188-e2a3c58e2a2b%2F05b8e014-5152-4854-8fcb-c4a9d3da2114%2F3000x3000%2Fnyt-ezraklein-albumartwork-3000px-2.jpg%3Faid%3Drss_feed&w=200&h=200)


## The Origins of Abundance

[[The Ezra Klein Show\|The Ezra Klein Show]] replayed an episode about the release of [[Ezra Klein\|Ezra Klein]] new book “[[01 CONSUME/Books/Abundance\|Abundance]]” my co-author [[Derek Thompson\|Derek Thompson]] had me on his podcast, “[Plain English](https://www.theringer.com/podcasts/plain-english-with-derek-thompson),” to talk about it. We’re on book tour right now, so we’re doing a lot of talking about this book. But this conversation is different. It’s just Derek and me, and we get into the story of how the book came together, and all the people and ideas that influenced us – a kind of intellectual history of the abundance agenda. And I thought the audience of this show might find this interesting too.
