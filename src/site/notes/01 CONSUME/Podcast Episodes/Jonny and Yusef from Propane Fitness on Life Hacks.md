  Hack productivity with the zygonic effect by leaving sentences part finished. We've spoken about the zygonic effect before. It is a psychological bias that was discovered by this guy who was studying waiters and waitresses in restaurants. And he was very impressed. It's super impressive when you see someone that comes up and asks you your order and doesn't write anything down. And just looking at you while you say it, this lady did it in Vegas for an entire table of 10 people. The start is in Maine, didn't write a single thing down, nothing was wrong. And it all came out to the right people as well. I was like, fucking hell. That's 20% to 25% tip worthy. If you want to give us a bit of a flourish, you do some card tricks or saying or something. But what this guy realized is that the servers had an unbelievably accurate ability to recall what each table had ordered while the orders and checks were still open. And as soon as the checks had gone, their ability to remember things had completely vanished. It's the same as anyone who, like me at university, crammed for exams. You'll be able to remember really, really closely what it is, all of the different accounting principles or whatever that you've been researching. And yet as soon as the exams done and that loop is closed, everything's gone. And this is the same reason that Netflix shows you cliffhangers at the end of them to get you to watch the next one because the human mind abhors this sort of open loop and it likes a closed Loop. It's the open and closed loop dynamic that we've got. And the way that you can use this to hack productivity is give yourself an easier in when you go to restart a project. And this is something Michael Malist does as a writer. I know a bunch of my other writer friends do as well that they leave sentences part finished as they close the day out, which means that when they then begin the next day, how hard is it to Finish a sentence? Like you're basically up and running already and then before you know it, you're writing. It also means that your open loop system is a little bit more activated throughout the remainder of the break between doing the project again, finishing it and doing it again. So you're thinking about it a bit more. You're considering what it is that you need to do. So I do that with some of the stuff that I'm starting to write now. I'm starting to do some longer form stuff. And yeah, leaving sentences part finished is a nice solution. Nice.

  So you know, having to start the day and kind of crack the shell of the task and it's Oh, finishing something at the end of a chapter, you know, and you go, okay, let's start this new chapter
  Speaker 1
  Now. Really, really difficult. It's hard enough to begin a task in any case. It's just a case of making it as easy as possible for you to get going. [Time 0:41:06](https://readwise.io/open/543804610)
