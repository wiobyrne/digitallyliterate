<blockquote><b>Sheila Heen</b><br/><br/>My team and I reviewed the last conversation we had, which I always do before a conversation like this. So went through the entire round one and there was a line that stood out for all of us. And it might be a paraphrase. You can feel free to fact check this. Yeah. Yeah.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Tim Ferriss</b><br/><br/>Oh, I can't wait to hear what you're about to say.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Sheila Heen</b><br/><br/>Quote, it's not just that we have difficult conversations in our most important relationships. Those conversations are the relationship. And I've been thinking about this a lot in the sense that it seems like our most important relationships are defined and steered in large part by how we handle the difficult conversations, How we handle things when we are perhaps not our best selves.</blockquote>

<blockquote><b>Sheila Heen</b><br/><br/>Quote, it's not just that we have difficult conversations in our most important relationships. Those conversations are the relationship. And I've been thinking about this a lot in the sense that it seems like our most important relationships are defined and steered in large part by how we handle the difficult conversations, How we handle things when we are perhaps not our best selves. And to that extent, they are what define a good or a bad relationship. So I just wanted to share that because it stuck out for everyone who reviewed the last conversation that we had on the side of my team. How should we talk about, because we did discuss a lot surrounding difficult conversations, and we will edge into a lot of shared territory. But how should we talk about feedback?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Tim Ferriss</b><br/><br/>For me, when feedback is incoming, part of what I'm doing is scanning for what's wrong with it. We can circle back to this question because there's a great set of things that are typically wrong with the feedback, at least that other people give me. So it's a shift from, I have to decide whether I agree or disagree and what's wrong with it. Before I decide, let me just understand it. Let me just understand what they're trying to say. So if we go to what language does that suggest, you can ask questions in one of two directions. Feedback always has a past and a future. So you can either ask more about where it's coming from, say more about what you heard me say, or can you give me an example of that? Or tell me more about the impact that that had in the exchange.

### [09:26] Scanning for what's wrong and asking curiosity-forward questions in feedback


[üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (08:14 - 09:29)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/0ecfab20-927a-414f-bd88-e9d2d22245bc)

### ‚ú® Key takeaways
1. When receiving feedback, it is important to focus on understanding it before deciding whether to agree or disagree with it.
2. There are two directions to ask questions in when seeking clarification about feedback: the past and the future.
3. Curiosity about the motivations and observations behind feedback can be explored by asking questions about where it is coming from and the impact it had.
4. Forward-looking questions can help determine the suggested actions or changes that feedback implies.
5. When feeling defensive, asking questions about the future implications of the feedback may be easier.

And one thing that can help is just to name the surprise or the, this just came out of left field. I'm totally knocked off my center. So just saying, wow, okay, sorry, this is coming out of left field. So I'm just kind of on my back foot so that you're just naming where you're at in this moment. And sometimes just naming it can help you find your feet again, because you're like, okay, I've just accurately described where I'm at. I can be in that space. And now they know I'm in that space or just saying, okay, I'm feeling a little defensive. And then you can move to a question, a question that I've been using recently that has helped just quickly get to the heart of what's going on is what do you feel like I don't get? What is it that you feel I really don't get about whatever</blockquote>

### [46:07] Differentiating between appreciation and coaching feedback


[üéß Play snip - 2minÔ∏è (44:29 - 46:10)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/26eefab0-87ef-49b8-a2fd-222bbd807fb0)

### ‚ú® Summary
The speaker shared an experience where he asked for feedback on his work, expecting a vivisection, but received encouragement instead. He highlighted the importance of recognizing when someone needs appreciation rather than coaching and evaluation. He suggested being clear about what kind of feedback is needed and not always trusting the recipient's answer. Additionally, the speaker emphasized that in the early stages of a creative work, encouragement may be more valuable than specific coaching due to the need for further development before detailed feedback is beneficial.

<blockquote><b>Sheila Heen</b><br/><br/>Asked him to just vivisect my work. And his response was, basically, I've read it. I want to read more. Just keep going. And what I gleaned from that was that he said, that's great, kid. I recognize that you want me to tear this apart, and that's not what you need right now. So I'm actually going to give you the appreciation, not the coaching and evaluation. I'm gonna give you like the pat on the back and the kick in the ass just to keep going, because actually that's what you need right now. And he was right. Of course, I'm speculating a lot about his inner experience, but that's, I think, the intention behind the feedback that he gave me. So how do people take this framework, the three kinds of feedback, and put it into practice, I suppose? What are some ways that people might think about carrying that into their day? They listen to this, they carry it into their day or their week.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Tim Ferriss</b><br/><br/>One thing that helps is just to be clearer about what you're short on right now or what you're asking someone for, or if you're being asked to give feedback, to ask them and maybe not trust Their answer. What I hear him saying is implicitly, we're speculating. Maybe I think what you just need is the encouragement to keep going right now. He could also be thinking in the early stages of any fiction, there are a hundred things wrong with it. You don't figure out what they are until you're further down the road and you're coming back and revising. So you're just not at the stage that's a good match for specific coaching because</blockquote>

[üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (45:24 - 46:40)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/95d0960c-7307-4a3a-a8e1-ad52424fe7cf)

### ‚ú® Summary
Clear communication is crucial when asking for or providing feedback, as it helps in understanding what is needed at the moment. It is important to differentiate between coaching and evaluation when providing feedback, as they serve different purposes. Encouragement and perseverance can be essential in the early stages of any project, as it takes time to identify and address its flaws. Different types of feedback include appreciation, coaching, and evaluation, and all three are necessary in different contexts.
