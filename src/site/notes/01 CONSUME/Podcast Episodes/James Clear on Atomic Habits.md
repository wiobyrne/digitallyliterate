You're creating the information flow, what the timeline, what the feed is going to look like. Or when you choose what book to read or which podcast episode to listen to, you're choosing the thoughts that are going to arise. Now, you may not necessarily know what they are, but over time, you can start to learn which sources of information are higher signal than others. And I almost feel like that is like the main habit to try to build, especially in our current modern society, because information overflowing and so widely accessible. The person who creates better information flows gets better thoughts.</blockquote>
