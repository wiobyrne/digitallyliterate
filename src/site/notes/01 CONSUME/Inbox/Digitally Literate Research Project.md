Consent to Participate in Survey Research

\*\*Please print a copy of this form to keep for your records.\*\*

You are invited to participate in a research study because you are a PK-16 teacher who may use instructional technologies as part of literacy instruction. This research, to be conducted by Drs. W. Ian O'Byrne (College of Charleston) and Michelle Schira Hagerman (University of Ottawa), is designed to provide insight into the knowledge, skills, and dispositions that skilled educators use as they integrate digital literacies into instruction.

**What is Involved?**  
Participation in this study will require about **30 minutes** of your time.

  
Participation requires you to complete an online survey that asks a series of questions related to your literacies teaching practices with technologies. We are interested in understanding the knowledge, skills, and strategies you use to embed digital texts and tools into literacy instruction. We are interested in understanding the kinds of professional development that teachers have received to support their integration of digital technologies in their teaching, and also the professional development that they would like to receive.

**Confidentiality**  
Any information you provide in the survey will be kept strictly confidential. No personally identifiable information will be shared. Survey data will be aggregated for analyses.

  
If you are willing to permit us to quote your responses explicitly in the report of our research, please check the box (below) that indicates your permission. Know that we would not use your real name if we quote your ideas. We would assign a pseudonym to protect your identity.

  
You would be given an opportunity to review the section of our report in which your quote appears before completion of the research. 

Please be aware that files will be sent to your email address and a secure connection may not be guaranteed as your data is transmitted over the Internet. In order to minimize the risk of security breaches and to help ensure your confidentiality we recommend that you use standard safety measures such as signing out of your account, closing your browser and locking your screen or device when you are no longer using them / when you have completed the study.

**Follow-up Interview**

On the basis of your survey responses, you may be selected for a follow-up interview that would take place online. Participation in the interview would require an additional 60 minutes. If selected to be interviewed, and if you agree, you will be interviewed using online video conferencing software. Your interview will be video recorded and saved. This will enable the researchers to analyze and learn from your responses.

  
After the interview, you will have the option of permitting us to share your interview publicly on a website dedicated to documenting the ways that teachers around the world are integrating technologies to support literacies learning. The website is http://digitallyliterate.net/.

  
**Risks and Benefits**  
Although it is not anticipated that you will benefit directly through your involvement in this study, this research is expected to benefit educators globally by testing important research questions about literacy and technology inclusion practices in many educational contexts by identifying how educators use these technologies in instruction and what need they may have to further enhance education.

  
Although we do not anticipate any risks or discomfort associated with participation in this research study, we understand that some participants may feel uneasy when asked to evaluate and report on their professional development experiences. It is important to re-iterate that your participation is completely voluntary. You may choose to not answer questions. You may choose to discontinue participation at any time. You may also choose to withdraw your data should you choose to withdraw from the study at any time. To withdraw participation or data from the study, you would need only send an email to one (or both) of the principal investigators, indicating your intentions.
