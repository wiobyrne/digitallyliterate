## Extended Summary
"The Ghost Brigades" is the second book in John Scalzi's 'Old Man's War' series. It takes place in a universe where humans have colonized space and regularly come into conflict with various alien species. To defend themselves, humans have developed an elite fighting force known as the Colonial Defense Forces (CDF), which utilize advanced technology including cloning and consciousness transfer.

The protagonist is Jared Dirac, a clone of Charles Boutin, a brilliant scientist who betrayed humanity by aligning himself with three hostile alien races. Hoping to gain insight into Boutin's plans, the CDF creates Dirac by implanting Boutin's consciousness into his clone body. However, initially Dirac does not manifest any of Boutin’s memories or knowledge.

Dirac becomes part of the Special Forces (also known as "Ghost Brigades"), undergoing rigorous training and bonding with his fellow soldiers. Eventually, Boutin’s memories begin surfacing in Dirac. He learns that Boutin planned to use a device to transfer his consciousness into an unoccupied clone body after faking his death.

As Dirac grapples with his dual identity, he uncovers Boutin's alliance with several alien species planning to wage war on human colonies. He also discovers that he has been considered expendable by the CDF.

In the climax, Dirac confronts Boutin, eventually killing him and saving humanity from an impending attack. He chooses to keep Boutin's memories, gaining a deeper understanding of the universe and his own existence.

The novel explores themes of identity, consciousness, morality, and the ethics of technology.
