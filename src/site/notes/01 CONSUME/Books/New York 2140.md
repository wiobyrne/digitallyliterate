## Extended Summary
"New York 2140" by Kim Stanley Robinson is a science fiction novel set in a future where climate change has caused sea levels to rise drastically. The city of New York has been transformed into a "SuperVenice," with skyscrapers rising out of the water and people navigating the city in boats and skybridges.
