## Extended Summary
"Hatching Twitter" is an inside account of the birth, evolution, and tumultuous behind-the-scenes drama of one of the world's most popular social media platforms - Twitter. The narrative revolves around four friends - Jack Dorsey, Biz Stone, Evan Williams, and Noah Glass - who stumbled upon an idea that would transform how people communicate globally.

The book begins with the establishment of Odeo by Evan Williams and Noah Glass as a podcasting platform. After Apple launched podcasting on iTunes rendering Odeo redundant, Glass came up with an idea for a status-updating microblogging service – Twitter.

As Twitter started gaining traction among users worldwide for its simplicity and real-time communication feature, internal power dynamics began to shift. Jack Dorsey was initially appointed CEO but his management style led to his ousting by Williams. However, Dorsey didn’t retreat quietly; he masterminded his return as CEO years later by manipulating board members and capitalizing on William’s perceived weaknesses.

In this saga of ambition and power plays; Noah Glass was the first casualty despite being instrumental in conceptualising Twitter; he was ousted from the company early on with his contributions largely forgotten until Bilton’s account brought them back into focus.

"Hatching Twitter" provides an engaging look into how startups can be filled with tension as personal relationships intersect with business interests. It also underscores how ego clashes and power struggles can overshadow the shared vision that initially brings founders together.
