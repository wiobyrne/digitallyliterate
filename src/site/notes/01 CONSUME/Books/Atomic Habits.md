## Extended Summary
> "Atomic Habits" starts off by explaining the compound effect of small habits. It argues that if you get one percent better each day for one year, you'll end up thirty-seven times better by the time you’re done. Conversely, if you get one percent worse each day for one year, you'll decline nearly down to zero. The book emphasizes that success is the product of daily habits—not once-in-a-lifetime transformations.

> The author introduces a simple but powerful four-step model for building new habits—Cue, Craving, Response, Reward—and provides practical suggestions on how to apply this model in your life. He also highlights some innovative ways to reverse engineer this process to break bad habits.

> It also discusses concepts like habit stacking (the art of pairing new habits with existing ones) and environment design (structuring your physical environment in ways that support your desired habits). 

> The book ends with a discussion about how we can ensure our new tiny habits deliver outsized results in the long run.

## Key Points
> - Success is not a goal to reach but a system to improve.
> - The most effective way to change your habits is not to focus on what you want to achieve, but on who you wish to become.
> - Habits can be built by a process that involves cue, craving, response and reward.
> - The environment you create for yourself can have a dramatic impact on your habits.
> - The ultimate purpose of habits is to solve the problems of life with as little energy and effort as possible.

## Highlights

Focus on Identity over Outcome: ie "I'm the guy who..." over thinking about the result I want...Every action you take is you casting a vote for your identity.

Winners and losers often have the same goals, so what is it that actually makes a difference? It's the system and process behind the goal. Achieving your goal only changes your life for a moment. We think the results need to change, but it's the process that needs to change. Habits are the fundamental unit of your systems. Your current systems are perfectly designed to provide you with your current results. 

- **Cue** (Make it Obvious vs Invisible)
- **Craving** (Make it Attractive vs Unattractive) - timing is important
- **Routine** (Make it Easy vs Difficult)
- **Reward** (Make it Satisfying vs Unsatisfying) - Behaviors that are immediately rewarded get repeated. Behaviors that are immediately punished don't get repeated. That's why you need to make it enjoyable in the moment. One way is tying your identity to it. Frame your rewards.

- The first step is Awareness. Discover and record your habits throughout the day.
- The more specific the implementation, the more motivation, ie time, place, etc

The Goldilocks rule: is nothing more than Flow: balance challenge with ability, 3-4% beyond your current ability. You need victories to stay satisfied, but you need to be challenged. Apparently in this context, it's important to keep things from getting stale.
