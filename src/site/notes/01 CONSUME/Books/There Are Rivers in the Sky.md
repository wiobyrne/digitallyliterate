# There Are Rivers in the Sky
**Author:** [[Elif Shafak\|Elif Shafak]]

## Three-Sentence Summary
- - A single drop of water travels across centuries—from ancient Mesopotamia to contemporary London—binding four lives through its magical “aquatic memory.”
- We meet: an Assyrian ruler and his library of clay tablets; Arthur, a Thames‑born slum child turned Assyriologist; Narin, a Yazidi girl fleeing persecution in 2014; and Zaleekhah, a hydrologist in modern London wrestling with grief and climate science. 
- Shafak explores water as a vessel of memory, touching on themes of cultural trauma, environmental crisis, and human connection through evocative, interwoven storytelling.

## Extended Summary
The narrative is structured around one drop of water, introduced in ancient Nineveh with King Ashurbanipal and the Epic of Gilgamesh. Moving to Victorian London (circa 1840), Arthur Smyth, dubbed “King Arthur of the Sewers,” is born beside the Thames. Gifted with prodigious memory, he becomes an apprentice printer and later a scholar of cuneiform texts. In 2014, Narin, a ten-year-old Yazidi girl near the Tigris, faces baptism rites disrupted by conflict and displacement under ISIS, reflecting her community’s ongoing suffering. Finally, in 2018, Zaleekhah, a hydrologist on a London houseboat, grapples with personal loss, environmental concerns, and rediscovery of heritage. These timelines intersect through water’s symbolic presence—from a raindrop to a snowflake, baptismal tear, and back—emphasizing collective memory, trauma, resilience, and the ethics of cultural heritage.
