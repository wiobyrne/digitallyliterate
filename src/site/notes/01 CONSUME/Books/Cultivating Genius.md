## Extended Summary
"Cultivating Genius: An Equity Framework for Culturally and Historically Responsive Literacy" by Gholdy Muhammad is an innovative guide to teaching that seeks to empower educators in fostering a more inclusive learning environment. Drawing inspiration from black literary societies of the 19th century, Muhammad presents her equity framework for culturally and historically responsive literacy.

The book begins with a historical exploration of these societies, detailing how they enabled Black people to cultivate their genius against societal odds. They provided spaces for developing identity, skills enhancement, criticality and intellectualism. These four elements form the basis of Muhammad's equity framework.

In subsequent chapters, Muhammad expounds on each element. She emphasizes that identity development should involve self-understanding as well as understanding others' perspectives. Skill enhancement goes beyond academic abilities to include cultural competencies and social-emotional skills. Intellectualism involves both gaining knowledge and using it to engage with the world critically. Lastly, criticality refers to analyzing societal norms and challenging inequities.

Muhammad provides practical strategies for implementing this framework into classroom instruction and curriculum design. For example, she suggests activities like student-led discussions on social issues or projects focused on community impact.

Throughout "Cultivating Genius", Muhammad stresses the importance of promoting diversity in education. She argues that recognizing students' individual genius not only enhances their learning experience but also contributes to societal progress.
