## Extended Summary
"The Source of Self-Regard" is divided into three parts: "The Foreigner's Home", "Black Matter(s)", and "God's Language". The first part consists mainly of Morrison's speeches on various topics like human rights, immigration, and the role of artists in society.

The second part, "Black Matter(s)", consists primarily of literary criticism. Here Morrison explores African American literature's role in shaping America's cultural consciousness. She discusses how black writers have engaged with themes like slavery and racial discrimination to redefine American literature.

One significant theme that runs through this book is Morrison’s belief in the transformative power of language. According to her, language can be a powerful tool for resistance against oppression and injustice. Another recurring theme is her exploration of 'the other'; she believes that understanding ‘the other’ is crucial for self-understanding.
