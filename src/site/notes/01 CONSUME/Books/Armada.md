- **Author:** [[01 CONSUME/People/Ernest Cline\|Ernest Cline]]

## Three-Sentence Summary
- Zack Lightman, a high school student and gaming enthusiast, discovers that the video game he has been obsessively playing, Armada, is actually a training simulation designed by the government to prepare for an alien invasion.

As he trains and fights in the ensuing war, Zack grapples with the blurred lines between reality and the virtual world.

## Extended Summary
Armada follows teenager Zack Lightman who lives in Beaverton, Oregon. An avid gamer, he spends most of his time playing Armada, a popular online flight simulator game where players defend Earth from alien invaders. One day at school, Zack sees a flying saucer exactly like those in Armada hovering in the sky outside his classroom window. Soon after this sighting, he is whisked away by government agents and taken to a secret base where he learns that Armada is not just a game but a training program for actual space combat.

The EDA reveals that they have known about an impending alien invasion for decades and have been preparing humanity to fight back by using video games as training simulations. The aliens are called Europans from Europa, one of Jupiter's moons. Zack also discovers that his father who died in a sewage plant accident when he was an infant is alive and has been fighting off Europans all these years.

Zack joins other elite gamers to pilot drones against the aliens' forces. He meets his father at the base and they form a close bond despite some initial tension. As they fight together against the alien invasion, Zack becomes increasingly skeptical about Europans intentions.

In a final epic battle scene above Europa's surface involving both human-controlled drones and manned spacecrafts from all nations of earth against Europans, Zack's father sacrifices himself to destroy the Europans' weapon. In the aftermath, Zack discovers that the invasion was a test by Europans to assess humans' ability to unite and defend themselves. The novel ends with Earth preparing for peaceful contact with Europans.
