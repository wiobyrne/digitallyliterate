## Extended Summary
"Fear: Trump in the White House" chronicles the tumultuous first years of Donald Trump’s presidency as seen by veteran journalist Bob Woodward. Drawing on hundreds of hours of interviews with most members of the Trump administration, it provides a detailed account of infighting, dysfunction, and chaos within the White House.

The book begins at the onset of Trump's campaign for presidency, exploring his unorthodox approach to politics marked by a disregard for established norms. It then follows his transition into office and his struggles to adapt to the role. Key events covered include controversial decisions such as withdrawing from international treaties like Paris Climate Agreement and Trans-Pacific Partnership; handling issues such as immigration; dealing with foreign crises involving North Korea and Russia; as well as internal scandals including investigation into Russian interference in 2016 election.

Woodward portrays President Trump as impulsive, often ignorant about basic aspects of governance, prone to making false or misleading statements, and dismissive or hostile toward anyone who challenges him. This has led to high staff turnover rate and constant state of crisis.

Major figures featured include Steve Bannon, Reince Priebus, John Kelly, James Mattis among others - each struggling to contain or direct President's impulses while navigating their own political agendas.
