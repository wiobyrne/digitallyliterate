## Extended Summary
"The Peripheral" starts with protagonist Flynne Fisher living in rural America in the near future where she ekes out her living by participating in beta tests for video games. Her life takes an unexpected turn when she witnesses what seems like a gruesome murder while beta testing a game. The twist is that this murder doesnâ€™t occur in her timeline but instead takes place 70 years into her future.

In this far-future timeline lives Wilf Netherton, a publicist who works with celebrities who have been resurrected using advanced technology. When Flynne witnesses the murder of one of his clients, Wilf's narrative intertwines with hers. They discover that they can communicate across timelines using peripherals - devices that allow users to control avatars or bodies remotely.

The novel delves deep into the exploration of these two futures - one on the brink of disaster due to economic collapse and environmental degradation, and another devastated by events known as "the jackpot", which wiped out most of humanity but left behind advanced technology and an extreme wealth gap.

As they investigate the murder together from different timelines, they uncover political conspiracies involving powerful figures manipulating society from behind the scenes. Throughout their journey, Gibson explores themes such as how technology influences society, humanity's struggle for survival amidst technological advancement and societal collapse, and power dynamics in a dystopic future.
