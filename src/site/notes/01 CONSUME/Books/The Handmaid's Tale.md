## Extended Summary
"The Handmaid's Tale" by Margaret Atwood is a dystopian novel set in a totalitarian state named Gilead that has overthrown the United States. In Gilead society, women have lost their rights and are strictly categorized based on their fertility status. Our narrator Offred is one such woman – a 'handmaid' designated to bear children for an elite couple because she is fertile.

Offred serves the Commander and his wife Serena Joy. She must partake in ritualistic copulations with the Commander while Serena watches – a dehumanizing act highlighting the society's twisted nature. Through Offred’s perspective, Atwood presents oppressive societal structures where power dynamics are skewed towards men.

The narrative alternates between Offred’s present life as a handmaid and her past life before Gilead’s rise. These flashbacks reveal her former identity as June, who had a husband named Luke and a daughter. Both were separated from her during an attempted escape from Gilead.

Throughout the novel, Offred subtly resists her circumstances with acts like engaging in forbidden games of Scrabble with the Commander or pursuing an illicit affair with Nick, the Commander's driver. Her small acts of defiance give readers glimpses into human resilience amid oppressive conditions.

Key themes in "The Handmaid's Tale" include the danger of totalitarian regimes, corruption of power, subjugation, and manipulation of women, loss of identity, and the importance of storytelling as a means to preserve one's identity. The story ends ambiguously with Offred being taken away by men dressed as the secret police known as the Eyes – leaving readers unsure if she’s being rescued or arrested.
