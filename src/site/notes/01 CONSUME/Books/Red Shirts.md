# Red Shirts

## Overview
- **Author:** [[John Scalzi\|John Scalzi]] 

## Three-Sentence Summary
- "Red Shirts" is a satirical science fiction novel that explores the trope of expendable characters in TV shows, particularly those in Star Trek. The story follows a group of new recruits on the starship Intrepid who soon realize that their roles as low-ranking crew members put them at high risk during away missions. Through a blend of humor, metafiction, and existential philosophy, author John Scalzi critiques narrative conventions and highlights the value of each individual life.

## Extended Summary
"Red Shirts" begins with Ensign Andrew Dahl joining the crew of the Universal Union flagship Intrepid. Along with his fellow new recruits, Dahl quickly notices that low-ranking crew members have an unusually high mortality rate on away missions—especially those who wear red shirts. As they investigate this phenomenon, they discover that their reality is being shaped by a sci-fi television show from Earth's past.

The novel's narrative structure includes three codas written in different formats (first person, second person, third person), which serve to deepen the exploration of its themes. These codas focus on the characters from the TV show who have been 'writing' the fates of Dahl and his friends. This metafictional device allows Scalzi to play with concepts of free will and determinism.

The book is characterized by its humor and satirical take on classic sci-fi tropes. At the same time, it delves into deeper philosophical questions about existence and purpose. The main characters are well-developed and their struggle to take control of their own destinies forms an engaging emotional core for the story.
