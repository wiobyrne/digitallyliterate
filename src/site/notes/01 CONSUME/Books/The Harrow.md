## Extended Summary

_The Harrow_ (published May 1, 2025) is Noah Eaton’s sharply plotted debut novel that blends crime thriller conventions with biting social commentary. Set in modern London, it centers on The Harrow—a tenacious but cash-strapped local investigative magazine determined to expose scandal, corruption, and gangland crimes.

John Salmon, the magazine’s embittered editor, has fought for years to preserve its legacy. Into this fraught world steps Danny Roth, a rookie journalist fresh out of university. Danny convinces John to let him pursue a grisly gangland murder—and soon their investigations collide with a council cover‑up John's been quietly tracking. As they dig deeper, they face threats from criminal and political powers, placing their careers—and lives—on the line.

Eaton structures the narrative as a classic whodunit with red herrings, unexpected alliances, and mounting danger, all narrated with a dry, dark wit. Characters are vividly drawn: John, with his grizzled integrity; Danny, whose youthful ambition and naiveté inject energy and risk; and a cast of gangsters, corrupt officials, and misfits who populate both London's underbelly and council chambers.

Beyond its plot, _The Harrow_ is a meta‑text on journalism’s decline. It laments the extinction of local muck‑raking in favor of instant digital content, while championing the power of tenacious reporting to hold power to account. The novel's tone—equal parts gritty and wry—uses humor and suspense to probe questions of truth, responsibility, and the price of exposing wrongdoing.
