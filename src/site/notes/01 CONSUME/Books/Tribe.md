# Tribe

## Overview

## Three-Sentence Summary
- "Tribe" by Sebastian Junger explores the idea that modern society has moved away from the close-knit communities that characterized our ancestors, leading to a pervasive feeling of disconnectedness and discontentment. He argues that in times of crisis, such as war or natural disasters, humans instinctively revert back to a tribal mentality where cooperation and unity are paramount. Through examining various societies and historical events, Junger asserts the importance of community and belonging for human well-being.

## Extended Summary
In "Tribe," journalist and author Sebastian Junger delves into the human instinct to belong to small, tightly-knit groups, which he calls tribes. He contends that our evolution as a species was shaped within these tribal structures where cooperation was necessary for survival.

The book begins with an examination of Native American societies and early European settlers who frequently chose to join indigenous tribes rather than remain within their colonial societies. This serves as a launching point for Junger's argument that there is an inherent appeal in the tribal way of life â€“ one characterized by equality, shared purpose, and close social bonds.

Junger explores how this tribal instinct emerges during crises. He uses examples from war zones and natural disasters to illustrate how people often report feeling a sense of belonging and purpose during these challenging times due to the communal effort required to survive. For instance, he discusses how soldiers often find it hard to re-integrate into civilian society after experiencing the intense comradeship of battle.

In contrast, modern Western societies with their emphasis on individualism and material success have led many people feeling isolated and unfulfilled. According to Junger, this lack of community is at the root of many contemporary societal issues such as mental health problems and political polarization.

Throughout "Tribe," Junger argues for a reevaluation of our societal values towards prioritizing community and shared experiences. He suggests that recognizing and fostering our tribal instincts can lead to a more fulfilling life and a healthier society.
