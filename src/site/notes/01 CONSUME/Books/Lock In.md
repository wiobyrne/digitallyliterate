## Extended Summary
"Lock In" by John Scalzi is set in the near future where Haden's Syndrome, a highly contagious flu-like virus has swept across the globe. For most victims, it's just like any other flu but for one percent of sufferers - referred to as "Hadens", they are left fully paralyzed but mentally alert - a condition known as 'lock in'.

To help Hadens interact with the world again, neural networks have been developed that allow them to control "threeps," robotic bodies named after C3PO from Star Wars. Chris Shane is one such Haden who uses his threep to work as an FBI agent.

The story follows Shane and his partner, Agent Vann on their investigation into a murder that involves an integrator - individuals who can let Hadens use their bodies. This leads them into a web of corporate greed and political conspiracy.
