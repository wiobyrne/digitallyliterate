## Extended Summary
"Time Travel" by James Gleick is a comprehensive exploration into the concept of time travel from its inception in literature to present day theories in theoretical physics. The book begins with a history of how we understand time, from ancient civilizations to Newton's absolute time, and Einstein's theory of relativity.

The author then delves into the idea's first appearance in literature with H.G. Wells' "The Time Machine", followed by an exploration of how other authors have expanded on this concept. He discusses how these literary works have both reflected and influenced our cultural perception of time travel.

In addition to literature, Gleick also covers the scientific aspect of time travel. He explains complex theories such as quantum mechanics, wormholes, and black holes in an accessible way that lay readers can understand.

Throughout the book, Gleick explores philosophical questions about free will, destiny, paradoxes associated with changing past events, and implications for human understanding.

Overall, "Time Travel" is not just about science fiction or fantasy; itâ€™s about understanding our relationship with time itself - how we measure it, experience it and think about it.
