## Extended Summary
The Cambridge Concise History of Astronomy is a comprehensive and accessible guide to the history of astronomy. Starting from ancient interpretations of celestial objects and phenomena, it details how different civilizations contributed to our understanding of space. The book covers various cultural contexts, including ancient Greek, Chinese, Islamic, and Western European perspectives.

The narrative progresses chronologically through major periods in history such as Renaissance, Enlightenment, Industrial Age till modern times. It highlights significant milestones like Copernicus's heliocentric model, Galileo's use of telescope for astronomical observations, Kepler's laws of planetary motion, Newton's law of gravity and more recently Hubble's discovery expanding universe.

The later part focuses on developments in the 20th century such as space exploration missions NASA's Hubble Space Telescope and Voyager missions. It concludes with current research efforts like detection gravitational waves or search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI).

Throughout the book Hoskin emphasizes importance interdisciplinary approach in study astronomy. He explores how mathematics, physics or even philosophy have influenced astronomical theories.

## Readwise Highlights

- Astronomy is one of the oldest sciences, and one which has repeatedly led to fundamental changes in our view of the world. This book covers the history of our study of the cosmos from prehistory to a survey of modern astronomy and astrophysics. It does not attempt to cover everything, but deliberately concentrates on the important themes and topics, including stellar astronomy in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries--the source of many important concepts in modern astronomy--and the Copernican revolution, which led to the challenge of ancient authorities in many areas other than astronomy. This is an essential text for students of the history of science and for students of astronomy who require a historical background to their studies.
