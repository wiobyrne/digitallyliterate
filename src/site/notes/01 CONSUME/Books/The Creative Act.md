##  Highlights

- To create is to bring something into existence that wasn’t there before. [Location 113](https://readwise.io/open/551465802)

- To live as an artist is a way of being in the world. A way of perceiving. A practice of paying attention. [Location 124](https://readwise.io/open/551465803)

- If you have an idea you’re excited about and you don’t bring it to life, it’s not uncommon for the idea to find its voice through another maker. This isn’t because the other artist stole your idea, but because the idea’s time has come. [Location 154](https://readwise.io/open/551465804)

- The best artists tend to be the ones with the most sensitive antennae to draw in the energy resonating at a particular moment. Many great artists first develop sensitive antennae not to create art but to protect themselves. They have to protect themselves because everything hurts more. They feel everything more deeply.

- How do we pick up on a signal that can neither be heard nor be defined? The answer is not to look for it. Nor do we attempt to predict or analyze our way into it. Instead, we create an open space that allows it. [Location 170](https://readwise.io/open/551465806)

- Artists who are able to continually create great works throughout their lives often manage to preserve these childlike qualities. Practicing a way of being that allows you to see the world through uncorrupted, innocent eyes can free you to act in concert with the universe’s timetable.

- There’s a time for certain ideas to arrive, and they find a way to express themselves through us. [Location 181](https://readwise.io/open/551465808)

- If something strikes me as interesting or beautiful, first I live that experience. Only afterward might I attempt to understand it. [Location 225](https://readwise.io/open/551465809)

- The ability to look deeply is the root of creativity. To see past the ordinary and mundane and get to what might otherwise be invisible. [Location 234](https://readwise.io/open/551465810)

- To navigate our way through this immense world of data, we learn early in life to focus on information that appears essential or of particular interest. And to tune out the rest. [Location 246](https://readwise.io/open/551465811)

- One can think of the creative act as taking the sum of our vessel’s contents as potential material, selecting for elements that seem useful or significant in the moment, and re-presenting them. [Location 255](https://readwise.io/open/551465812)

- Source makes available. The filter distills. The vessel receives. And often this happens beyond our control. [Location 259](https://readwise.io/open/551465813)
{ #rw551465813}


- The act of creation is an attempt to enter a mysterious realm. A longing to transcend. What we create allows us to share glimpses of an inner landscape, one that is beyond our understanding. Art is our portal to the unseen world. [Location 273](https://readwise.io/open/598395369)
