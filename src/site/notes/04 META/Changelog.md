## Updates

### [2024-12-08] Digital Garden Integration

- **Action**:
    - Connected the Digital Garden plugin to GitHub for seamless publishing.
    - Configured the repository to align with plugin requirements:
        - Added `src/site/notes` as the default directory for published notes.
        - Standardized YAML fields, including `dg-publish: true` for publish-ready notes.
    - Tested the plugin by publishing the home note and initial book notes.
- **Reason**: Establish an efficient workflow for publishing notes to the digital garden.
- **Impact**: Enabled direct integration between the vault and GitHub for public sharing.

### [2024-12-08] High-Quality Book Cover Images

- **Action**:
    - Updated all book notes with high-resolution cover images from the Google Books API.
    - Configured the cover URL in YAML to use a Templater script for generating high-quality links:
      ```yaml
  cover: <%=book.coverUrl ? `https://books.google.com/books/publisher/content/images/frontcover/${[...book.coverUrl.split("&")[0].matchAll(/id.?(.*)/g)][0][1]}?fife=w600-h900&source=gbs_api` : ''%>
      ```
    - Enabled saving cover images locally in `04 META/Attachments` and plan to automate this process in the future.
- **Reason**: Enhance the visual presentation of book notes.
- **Impact**: Improved consistency and aesthetics in the Books section.

### [2024-12-08] YAML and Tagging Standardization

- **Action**:
    - Transitioned all tags to lowercase, dash-separated format for consistency (e.g., `#american-politics`).
    - Updated YAML structure for book notes to include:
        - `shelf` field indicating reading status (e.g., `to_read`, `reading`, `read`).
        - `status` field for progress (`ðŸŒ±_seed`, `ðŸŒ¿_plant`, `ðŸŒ³_evergreen`).
        - Tags reflecting the book's themes and content, added manually during processing.
- **Reason**: To align with YAML best practices and improve readability and consistency.
- **Impact**: Streamlined tag management and improved compatibility with Dataview queries.

### [2024-12-08] Book Notes Workflow Update

- **Action**:
    - Refined workflow combining the Book Search plugin for metadata generation and Text Generator for AI-driven summaries and tags.
    - Workflow steps:
        1. Use Book Search to generate initial metadata and note structure.
        2. Use Text Generator to populate summaries, extended content, and suggested tags.
        3. Manually review and clean tags before adding them to YAML.
        4. Progress notes from `seed` to `plant` and `evergreen` as they are developed.
- **Reason**: Create a comprehensive and systematic approach to book notes.
- **Impact**: Increased efficiency in creating, organizing, and refining book notes.

### [2024-12-08] Notes Development and Folder Strategy

- **Action**:
    - Consolidated Seeds, Plants, and Evergreens into `02 CREATE/Notes` with clear status indicators for progress.
    - Reaffirmed folder structure:
        - `01 CONSUME`: Raw, unprocessed content.
        - `02 CREATE`: Developed notes and ideas, organized by progression stage.
    - Adjusted workflows to accommodate the Digital Garden's publishing requirements:
        - Ensured all notes to be published are saved in `src/site/notes` for compatibility.
        - Standardized YAML fields (`dg-publish: true`) for seamless publishing.
    - Excluded `04 META/Templates` from auto-move configurations to avoid unintended movements.
- **Reason**: Streamline note-taking and reduce folder clutter while aligning with Digital Garden requirements.
- **Impact**: Improved clarity in organizing and processing notes and ensured compatibility with the Digital Garden plugin.

### [2024-12-08] Templater Integration

- **Action**:
    - Enhanced book template with dynamic fields for generating high-quality cover URLs, YAML formatting, and AI-driven tag suggestions.
    - Incorporated a Templater script for auto-generating YAML entries:
      ```javascript
      <%* if (book.coverUrl) {     const highResCover = `https://books.google.com/books/publisher/content/images/frontcover/${[...book.coverUrl.split("&")[0].matchAll(/id.?(.*)/g)][0][1]}?fife=w600-h900&source=gbs_api`;     tR += `cover: "${highResCover}"`; } else {     tR += `cover: ""`; } %>
      ```
    - Configured Text Generator to output lowercase, dash-separated tags for consistency.
- **Reason**: Automate repetitive tasks and ensure consistent metadata across notes.
- **Impact**: Reduced manual work and improved metadata accuracy.

### [2024-12-08] Improved Book Note Aesthetics

- **Action**:
    - Added YAML fields and note sections to standardize book summaries, extended content, and related reading suggestions.
    - Included a field to reference local cover images for offline use if needed.
- **Reason**: To make book notes visually appealing and functionally comprehensive.

    - Build queries to track unprocessed and progressing notes in `01 CONSUME` and `02 CREATE`.
    - Develop a dashboard for Seeds, Plants, and Evergreens needing further work.
- **Refinement of Book Notes**:
    - Manually process each book note to update YAML tags and fields.
    - Expand summaries and ensure all sections are complete before moving to Evergreen status.
