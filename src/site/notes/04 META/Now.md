# Now

This is my "now page" ‚Äì a snapshot of what I'm currently focused on, learning about, and caring about. Inspired by [Derek Sivers' now page movement](https://sive.rs/nowff).

## üîç Current Focus

I'm primarily working on:

- **Digital Literacy Research**: Investigating how learners develop critical assessment skills in online environments, particularly in relation to the ethical use of technology and AI.
- **Course Development and Teaching**: Teaching courses on Language and Literacy as well as STEAM Education.
- **Writing and Publishing**: Currently finalizing publications on anti-racism and digital literacy, as well as a chapter on critical research in digital literacy.

## üìö What I'm Reading

- **Currently**: [[01 CONSUME/Books/Ender's Game\|Ender's Game]]. I'm doing some driving with just the kids and listening to this on our travels.
- **Currently:** [[01 CONSUME/Books/Nexus\|Nexus]]. This is a really interesting deep dive into information, storytelling, AI, and narratives. Makes me think about [[01 CONSUME/Books/The Information\|The Information]].
- **Recently Finished**: [[01 CONSUME/Books/The Anxious Generation\|The Anxious Generation]]. It raises valid concerns about overprotective parenting and lack of free play, but the research isn't particularly strong. While some use it to demonize technology, that's a superficial interpretation. 
- **Recently Finished:** [[01 CONSUME/Books/King - A Life\|King - A Life]]. This serves as a powerful reminder that our current struggles for justice and humanity are part of a much longer historical continuum of resistance and hope.

## üå± Learning

Right now I'm learning about:

- **Knowledge Management Systems**: Experimenting with new plugins and workflows in Obsidian
- **Digital Garden Approaches**: Exploring different ways to organize and present interconnected ideas

## üìù Projects

- **Digital Garden**: Continuing to refine this space, recently adding this "Now" page
- **Newsletter**: Curating resources for the next issue of [[02 CURATE/Indexes/Newsletter Index\|my newsletter]]

## üí≠ Current Thoughts

A few things on my mind lately:

- How might we better scaffold digital literacy development across educational contexts?
- The relationship between creativity and structured knowledge management

## üîÑ Routine

- Writing each morning
- Teaching STEAM Courses
- Weekly research sessions on [[02 CURATE/Indexes/AI and Machine Learning Index\|AI and Machine Learning Index]]
- Building connections between ideas in this digital garden
