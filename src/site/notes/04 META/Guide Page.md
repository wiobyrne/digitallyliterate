# Guide Page

Welcome to the behind-the-scenes tour of my digital garden! Here's how I organize and grow ideas in this space.

## 🌱🌿🌲 Note Stages: Seed, Plant, Evergreen

In this digital garden, every note evolves through three main stages, marked by the tags 🌱_seed, 🌿_plant, and 🌲_evergreen. These tags reflect the level of development, not the folder or specific type of content. Notes in any folder—whether it's **01 CONSUME**, **02 CURATE**, or **03 CREATE**—can start as a seed, grow into a plant, and eventually mature into an evergreen.

- **🌱 Seed**: A fresh idea or thought in its earliest form. It’s rough, undeveloped, and might only be a single question or insight.
- **🌿 Plant**: A note that’s being expanded or connected to other ideas. It’s in progress and includes additional context, reflections, or links.
- **🌲 Evergreen**: A fully developed, polished note that is ready for long-term use or sharing. It contains deep insights, clear connections, or comprehensive explanations.

### How Notes Grow and Evolve

- **Dynamic Movement**: Notes can advance through these stages as I revisit and refine them. A highlight in **01 CONSUME** might become a seed, grow into a plant in **02 CURATE**, and mature into an evergreen essay in **03 CREATE**.
- **Morphing Over Time**: Notes can change their purpose or structure as they grow, potentially shifting between folders as they evolve into new forms.

## 📂 Folder Overview

### 01 CONSUME

- **Purpose**: Intake of raw material (books, articles, podcasts, etc.) and initial reference notes.
- **Examples**: Highlights, summaries, and fleeting thoughts, often tagged as 🌱_seed.

### 02 CURATE

- **Purpose**: Build connections and refine ideas into more structured notes (e.g., permanent notes or MOCs).
- **Examples**: Developing 🌿_plant notes or curating thematic Maps of Content.

### 03 CREATE

- **Purpose**: Develop and finalize ideas for sharing (blog posts, presentations, publications).
- **Examples**: Publishing 🌲_evergreen notes or drafting creative works.

## 🔍 Quick Gardening Tips

- **Tag Progress**: Use 🌱_seed, 🌿_plant, and 🌲_evergreen to track the maturity of notes across all folders.
- **Regular Review**: Revisit unprocessed or underdeveloped notes to keep ideas flowing.
- **Expect Evolution**: Notes may move between folders and morph into different forms as they grow.
