# Vault Organization Guide

## Welcome to My Digital Knowledge System

This is an Obsidian vault designed for efficient knowledge capture, development, and publishing. It follows a structured approach to move information from raw consumption through development stages to polished, publishable content that feeds my [Digital Garden](https://digitallyliterate.netlify.app/).

## 🎯 System Philosophy

### Growth Metaphor
Knowledge develops naturally through stages:
- **🌱 Seeds**: Raw ideas, initial thoughts, questions
- **🌿 Plants**: Developing concepts with emerging connections  
- **🌲 Evergreens**: Mature, well-developed insights ready for sharing

### Progressive Development Flow
```
Raw Content → Processing → Development → Publishing
📥 Capture → 🔄 Process → 🌱🌿🌲 Grow → 🌐 Share
```

## 📁 How Everything Is Organized

### **01 CONSUME** - Information Input
*Where external information enters the system*

- **📥 Inbox** - Quick capture for everything (max 48-hour residence)

## 🌐 Digital Garden Integration

### **Publishing Philosophy**
Selected content is published to share knowledge and demonstrate thinking processes. The digital garden showcases the natural evolution of ideas from seeds to mature insights.

### **What Gets Published**
- **Quality evergreens** that provide value to others
- **System documentation** to help others build similar systems
- **Developed insights** on digital literacy, education, and knowledge work
- **Useful guides and frameworks** that others can apply

### **Publishing Process**
1. **Develop** ideas through the seed → plant → evergreen progression
2. **Review** for quality, completeness, and public value
3. **Publish** by adding `dg-publish: true` to YAML frontmatter
4. **Deploy** automatically via Digital Garden plugin to GitHub/Netlify
