# Digital Garden Guide

Welcome to my digital garden — a working notebook where ideas grow from raw fragments into durable insights.

## How it works

Ideas move through stages of maturity:

| Stage | What it means |
|-------|---------------|
| 🌱 Seed | A raw capture — a quote, a question, a fragment worth keeping |
| 🌿 Plant | A developing idea with structure, connections, and open questions |
| 🌲 Evergreen | A durable insight — polished, reusable, ready to share |
| 🪴 Grove | A curated cluster of related Evergreens — a pathway through a theme |
| 🌳 Forest | A big-picture synthesis — what multiple Groves mean together |

Not every idea reaches every stage. That's the point — growth is selective.

## Where to start

- [[03 CREATE/🌳 Forests/Digital Literacy\|Digital Literacy]] — the Forest connecting privacy, sovereignty, resilience, and AI literacy
- [[03 CREATE/🪴 Groves/Digital Self-determination\|Digital Self-determination]] — the parent Grove for this garden's core themes
- [[03 CREATE/🪴 Groves/AI Literacy\|AI Literacy]] — understanding AI as a system of power, not just a tool
