## 🚀 Organizations hire me to solve three critical problems:
### 🏛️ **Your AI strategy lacks human-centered frameworks**
Most organizations rush to adopt AI tools without strategic frameworks for maintaining human agency and critical thinking.
### 🛡️ **Your information systems are vulnerable**
Without robust information integrity frameworks, misinformation threats can destroy institutional credibility overnight.
### 📈 **Your digital transformation efforts fail**
Technology implementations fail when they ignore the human systems that make change stick.
