# Digitally Literate

![headshot.png](/img/user/04%20META/%F0%9F%94%97%20Assets/headshot.png)

### Hi, I'm Ian O'Byrne.

I explore how people **read, write, and learn** in digital, connected spaces. I help design systems that support creativity, agency, and belonging.

I helped shape the **Mozilla Web Literacy Framework** and co-authored **NCTE’s Definition of Digital Literacy.** Frameworks that guide how educators and organizations navigate digital transformation.

My main website, [wiobyrne.com](https://wiobyrne.com/), is where I publish polished essays, research, and projects. This digital garden is my living, free-flowing space for experimentation, rough ideas, and ongoing exploration. Think of it as the lab behind the published work.

I also direct the **[Initiative for Literacy in a Digital Age](https://initiativeforliteracy.org/)**, where we build **ethical, community-driven approaches** to technology. This is grounded in **privacy by design**, **open infrastructure** and **digital equity**.

## 🧭 Current Focus

I’m currently exploring how we can:

- **Rewild personal knowledge management** — connecting PKM tools to the open web  
- **Build digital communities by design**, with privacy, trust, and stewardship as first principles  
- **Use AI as a cognitive amplifier**, supporting reflection and creativity without extraction  
- **Reimagine digital literacy** as collective sensemaking in a federated, open ecosystem  

These threads connect across my talks, writing, and collaborations across communities.
