# Digitally Literate

![headshot.png](/img/user/04%20META/%F0%9F%94%97%20Assets/headshot.png)

# **Hi, I’m Ian.**

I think about how we read, write, and learn in digital spaces.

I care about tools that help people feel creative, capable, and connected. Not overwhelmed or extracted from.

This site is my working notebook. A place to think out loud, test ideas, and share what I’m learning as I go.

If you’re looking for polished essays and formal projects, you’ll find those at **wiobyrne.com**.  If you want the messy middle, the experiments, questions, and half-formed thoughts, you’re in the right place.

## 🌿 What this is

Digitally Literate is a **digital garden**.

Notes grow here over time.  
Nothing is finished. Everything is evolving.

Ideas move through stages of maturity:

- 🌱 **Seeds** — quick notes, questions, fragments
- 🌿 **Plants** — developing connections and patterns
- 🌲 **Evergreens** — durable insights, polished and ready to share
- 🪴 **Groves** — curated clusters of related notes on a theme
- 🌳 **Forests** — big-picture syntheses across multiple groves

Not sure where to start? Try the [[Digital Garden Guide Page\|Start Here]] page, explore the [[03 CREATE/🪴 Groves/🪴 Groves\|Groves]], or just wander. Follow links. See what connects.

## 🧭 What I’m exploring lately

Right now I’m thinking about how we can:
- reconnect personal knowledge tools to the open web
- design digital communities around trust and stewardship
- use AI as a cognitive amplifier (not a replacement for thinking)
- treat digital literacy as collective sensemaking

Most posts touch one or more of these threads.
