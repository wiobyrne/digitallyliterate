# About Me

Hi, I'm **Ian O'Byrne**. I'm an educator, researcher, and lifelong learner thinking about the places where literacy, technology, and humanity intersect.

## What I do

I teach, write, and build frameworks for how we read, write, and participate in digital spaces. Some of my foundational work includes:

- Co-authoring **Mozilla's Web Literacy Framework**
- Co-writing **NCTE's Definition of Literacy in the Digital Age**
- Research with the **New Literacies Research Lab**
- Directing the **Initiative for Literacy in the Digital Age**

These days I'm especially interested in AI literacy, information integrity, digital sovereignty, and what it looks like to build communities around trust rather than extraction.

## What this garden is

This site is where I think out loud. It's a working notebook — messy, evolving, and honest about what I don't know yet. Ideas here range from rough fragments to polished frameworks. Some will become articles, talks, or curricula. Others are just for me to think with.

If you're curious what I'm working through right now, see [[04 META/👤 About Me/Now\|Now]].
