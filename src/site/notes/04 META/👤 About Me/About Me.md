# About Me

I'm **Ian O'Byrne** — educator, researcher, and writer. I work at the intersection of literacy, technology, and what it means to be human online.

I teach at the College of Charleston and direct the Initiative for Literacy in a Digital Age. My research focuses on how people read, write, and participate in digital spaces — and what that means for equity, agency, and learning.

This site is my working notebook. Ideas here range from rough fragments to polished frameworks. Some will become articles, talks, or courses. Others are just for me to think with. Nothing is finished. Everything is growing.
