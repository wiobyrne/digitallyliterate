# Contact

Say hello at [hello@digitallyliterate.net](mailto:hello@digitallyliterate.net).

I read everything and try to respond thoughtfully. If you’re working on something related to digital literacy, education, AI, or the open web — I’d like to hear about it.

## Speaking & Workshops

I keynote and run workshops on:

- Digital literacy and new media in education
- AI literacy — what it means for learners, teachers, and institutions
- Privacy, surveillance, and digital sovereignty
- Anti-racist approaches to educational technology

If you’re organizing a conference or running professional development in these areas, get in touch.

## Research & Collaboration

I work with researchers, educators, and organizations on projects related to literacy, technology, and equity. If you’re building something in this space and think there’s overlap, I’m open to a conversation.

## Media

For interviews or commentary on digital literacy, AI in education, or information environments, reach out directly.
