# ðŸ‘¤ About Me

Hi, Iâ€™m **Ian Oâ€™Byrne**, an educator, researcher, and lifelong learner exploring the intersections of literacy, technology, and humanity. This digital garden is where I develop the frameworks, explore emerging challenges, and share the thinking that organizations worldwide implement.

## Foundation Builder

My foundational contributions shape how entire industries approach digital literacy:

- **Co-authored Mozilla's Web Literacy Framework** â€” the foundational standard for internet literacy used globally
- **Co-wrote NCTE's Definition of Literacy in the Digital Age** â€” THE definitive framework every educator references
- **Assisted in foundational research with New Literacies Research Lab** â€” establishing core principles still guiding the field
- **Director of the Initiative for Literacy in the Digital Age** â€” pioneering institutional approaches to digital transformation

## Where Ideas Become Implementation

This digital garden serves as my laboratory for developing the next generation of digital literacy frameworks. The thinking you'll find here often becomes the strategies that organizations hire me to implement at scale.

**Current explorations include:**

- **Generative AI literacy frameworks** for institutional adoption
- **Information integrity systems** for combating digital misinformation
- **Connected learning architectures** for organizational transformation
- **Digital garden methodologies** for knowledge management at scale

## How I Think + Work

- **Systems Architect**: I design frameworks that scale from individual practice to institutional transformation
- **Bridge Builder**: I translate between academic research, practical implementation, and strategic policy
- **Future Scanner**: I identify emerging digital challenges before they become crises

## What I'm Developing Now

Current projects in this digital garden include frameworks for AI literacy at scale, institutional approaches to information integrity, and next-generation connected learning systems. These explorations inform the strategic consulting work I do with forward-thinking organizations.
