# Teaching Philosophy

*Empowering educators to thoughtfully integrate technology in ways that amplify student voice, promote equity, and develop critical digital literacies.*

---

## 🎯 Core Belief

**Learning is an active interaction that involves the acquisition and construction of knowledge, understanding, and behaviors that impact an individual's ability to understand, collaborate, and communicate successfully within their environment.**

I believe education should shift focus from teacher to student, with learners actively involved in their own learning process. As educators, we must "mind the gap" - the space between where our students are and where they need to be - while embracing vulnerability and cultivating resilience in ourselves and our learners.

## 🏛️ Theoretical Foundation

My educational philosophy is grounded in three complementary frameworks:

### **Critical Literacy** 
Students must learn to read the word and the world, questioning power structures and developing agency to transform their communities through literate action.

### **Social Constructivism**
Knowledge is co-constructed through social interaction, with learning happening in the zone of proximal development through collaboration and scaffolded support.

### **Multiliteracies Pedagogy**
In our digitally connected world, students need multiple ways to make meaning across diverse modes, media, and cultural contexts.

## 📚 Four Pillars of Practice

### 1. **🔍 Inquiry-Based Engagement**
I design learning experiences that are approachable and accessible, particularly for students beginning their education coursework. Students explore authentic problems, pursue their passions, and develop questions that drive their learning journey.

*In practice:* Using free online tools like Google Workspace for Education, encouraging students to create unit plans around their interests, and modeling "think alouds" to make my teaching process transparent.

### 2. **🤝 Collaborative Learning**
Collaboration is integral to both teaching and learning. I provide multiple opportunities for students to co-construct knowledge, learn from each other's processes, and engage in peer review and feedback cycles.

*In practice:* Cooperative projects, peer review systems, and social learning opportunities that mirror the collaborative nature of professional education work.

### 3. **📊 Varied Assessment Strategies** 
I integrate authentic evaluation strategies while maintaining high expectations and academic rigor. Students have multiple opportunities to demonstrate understanding across different contexts and modalities.

*In practice:* Formative and summative assessments that allow diverse expressions of learning, authentic performance tasks, and continuous reflection on assessment effectiveness.

### 4. **🪞 Reflective Practice**
As a reflective practitioner, I model continuous self-critique and improvement. Students learn to establish clear goals, evaluate procedures, and communicate effectively through sustained reflection.

*In practice:* Regular "think alouds" about my teaching decisions, integration of open scholarship practices, and explicit modeling of professional reflection cycles.

## 💻 Digital Age Considerations

**Technology always changes literacy, and literacy always changes how we communicate, learn, and define our world.**

In our rapidly evolving digital landscape, I help students navigate new literacies while maintaining focus on fundamental communication and critical thinking skills. Students learn to be creators, not just consumers, of digital content while developing the critical evaluation skills necessary for our information-rich world.

### **Preparing for Uncertain Futures**
- Students develop adaptive expertise rather than fixed skills
- Technology integration serves pedagogical purposes, not novelty
- Digital citizenship and ethical technology use are emphasized
- Multiple pathways for learning and expression are provided

## 🌉 Connecting Research and Teaching

My research informs my teaching practice, and my classroom experiences shape my research questions. This reciprocal relationship ensures:

- **Relevance:** Classroom practices are grounded in current research
- **Innovation:** New pedagogical models emerge from real classroom challenges  
- **Impact:** Research findings directly improve student learning experiences
- **Accessibility:** Open scholarship makes research findings available to global education communities

I actively work with local school districts to integrate literacy and technology into curriculum, maintaining connections between higher education and K-12 practice.

## 🎓 Approach to Teacher Preparation

**I help students transition from learners to leaders, from students to teachers.**

In teacher preparation courses, I focus on developing both knowledge and dispositions required for the profession. This involves:

### **Academic Rigor in Three Phases**
1. **Setting Standards:** Collaboratively establishing high expectations with students
2. **Supporting Achievement:** Providing instructional scaffolding and support systems  
3. **Demonstrating Mastery:** Creating varied opportunities for students to show learning

### **Professional Identity Development**
- Problematizing thinking about technology, literacy, pedagogy, and assessment
- Developing critical perspectives on educational equity and justice
- Building capacity for lifelong learning and professional growth
- Fostering collaborative professional relationships

---

## 🌍 Commitment to Equity and Justice

Education must address systemic inequities and prepare students to create more just communities. In my teaching:

- **Amplify marginalized voices** through curriculum and pedagogy choices
- **Address digital divides** by ensuring equitable access to technology and digital literacy
- **Question power structures** embedded in educational systems and practices  
- **Develop cultural responsiveness** in teaching approaches and content selection
- **Model anti-racist practices** in classroom interactions and curricular decisions

---

## 📈 Continuous Growth

As an educator, I commit to:

- **Staying current** with research and best practices in literacy and technology
- **Embracing vulnerability** as a pathway to growth and connection
- **Modeling lifelong learning** through my own professional development
- **Adapting practice** based on student feedback and learning outcomes
- **Contributing to the field** through open scholarship and professional service

*"We don't have to be perfect, just engaged and committed to aligning values with action."* - Brené Brown

This philosophy guides every aspect of my teaching practice, from course design to daily interactions with students, ensuring that technology integration serves human flourishing and social justice.
