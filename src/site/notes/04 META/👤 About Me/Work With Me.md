# Work With Me

I'm available for speaking, workshops, and consulting on digital literacy, AI in education, and what it means to read, write, and learn in digital spaces.

Get in touch: [hello@digitallyliterate.net](mailto:hello@digitallyliterate.net)

---

## Speaking

I keynote at conferences and run workshops for educators, administrators, and organizations. Topics I return to most:

- **Digital literacy** — how we read, write, and participate online, and what that means for equity and agency
- **AI literacy** — what AI systems are, how they work, and how to think critically about them as learners and teachers
- **Privacy and digital sovereignty** — surveillance in education, data rights, and building toward more open digital infrastructure
- **Anti-racist approaches to technology** — integrating equity and justice into how we teach with and about technology
- **Computational thinking** — across subjects and grade levels
- **Information disorder and media literacy** — how misinformation spreads and what critical readers and writers can do about it

**Formats:** Conference keynotes, half-day workshops, full-day institutes, panel facilitation, and professional development series.

## Consulting

I work with schools, districts, nonprofits, and higher education institutions on digital literacy programs, AI literacy curricula, and professional learning design.

This usually means reviewing or building curriculum, supporting professional development, or advising on how to integrate these topics into existing work.

## Background

I've been doing this work for 20+ years — in classrooms, in research, and in the field. I've keynoted internationally and have contributed to foundational work including the Mozilla Web Literacy Framework and NCTE's Definition of Literacy in the Digital Age. I was recognized with the Divergent Award for Excellence in 21st Century Literacies Research (2021) and named a Mozilla Network50 honoree (2017).
