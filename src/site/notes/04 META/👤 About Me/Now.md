# Now

This is my "now page" – a snapshot of what I'm currently focused on, learning about, and caring about. Inspired by [Derek Sivers' now page movement](https://sive.rs/now).

---

## 🔍 Current Focus

- **[[02 DEVELOP/🌿 Plants/Signpost Sessions Framework\|Signpost Sessions]]**: Facilitating cross-sector asynchronous learning sessions through [[02 DEVELOP/🌿 Plants/InitiatED 21st Century Educational Justice\|InitiatED]]. Building community infrastructure around collective inquiry and educator civil rights frameworks.
- **AI and Cybersecurity for K-8**: Developing background knowledge, learning materials, and assessments for teaching AI literacy and cybersecurity to younger students and their teachers.
- **[[02 DEVELOP/🌿 Plants/Digital Sovereignty Framework\|Digital Sovereignty]] in Practice**: Less theory, more doing. Self-hosting services, building out the homelab, and documenting what it actually takes to own your digital infrastructure.

## 📚 What I'm Reading

- **Currently**: [[Autobiography of Malcolm X\|Autobiography of Malcolm X]]. Reading alongside [[01 CONSUME/📚 Books/King - A Life\|King - A Life]] — a parallel track for understanding the longer history of struggle.
- **Currently**: [[01 CONSUME/📚 Books/Shop Class as Soulcraft\|Shop Class as Soulcraft]]. A philosopher-mechanic's look at the value of working with your hands. Connects more to my homelab and teaching work than I expected.
- **Recently Finished**: [[Surviving Autocracy\|Surviving Autocracy]]. A useful guide to understanding the corrosion of democratic norms and what it takes to push back.

*See my [[Book Index Public\|Book Index Public]] for detailed reading notes.*

## 🌱 Learning

- **Local AI**: Running [[02 DEVELOP/🌿 Plants/Local AI Setup - Ollama and AnythingLLM with Obsidian\|Ollama and AnythingLLM]] locally to work with my vault privately. Interested in what AI assistance looks like when the model stays on your hardware.
- **Network Infrastructure**: Sorting out the gap between my garage office and the main house. Learning more about Ubiquiti hardware and how to build a reliable setup without relying on consumer mesh systems.
- **Homelab Systems**: Each new service I spin up teaches me something — about Linux, about networking, about where my knowledge has gaps.

## 📝 Projects

- **Digital Garden**: Ongoing. Recently rebuilt the About Me section, converted the newsletter page to a dynamic template, and cleaned up a significant backlog of publishing conflicts.
- **[[02 DEVELOP/🌿 Plants/Homelab Journey Overview\|Homelab Blog Series]]**: Documenting the build — Proxmox, Frigate, Home Assistant, TrueNAS — as a public record of the process, not just the outcome.
- **Digitally Literate Newsletter**: Writing and curating the weekly [[04 META/🛠️ System/Digitally Literate\|Digitally Literate]] newsletter.
