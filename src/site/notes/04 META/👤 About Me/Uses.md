# Uses

This is my "/uses" page — inspired by [uses.tech](https://uses.tech/) — documenting the tools, software, and setup that power my work in digital literacy research and education.

My choices prioritize open standards, data portability, and privacy by design. I'm mid-migration away from surveillance-based platforms toward local-first and self-hosted alternatives. This page reflects that work in progress.

## 💻 Hardware

### Primary Setup

- **Desktop (Main)**: DIY build — Ryzen 7 5800X3D, NVIDIA RTX 4070 (12GB), running Ubuntu. Primary workstation for everything.
- **The Metal Box**: Repurposed Intel i7-3770 desktop running Proxmox. Home for all self-hosted services.
- **Lenovo T480p**: Recycled e-waste, rebuilt on Pop!_OS. Road machine and backup.
- **Monitors**: LG 32ML600M (32" FHD) plus repurposed Dell monitors.
- **Input**: Logitech MX Keys keyboard and MX Master 3 mouse. Also experimenting with a Huion Kamvas 13 pen display for sketching and markup.
- **Audio**: Sony WH-1000XM4 (over-ear) and Sony WF-1000XM4 (earbuds).

### Mobile

- **Phone**: Google Pixel 9 Pro XL
- **Tablet**: Boox Note Air 5c — primary e-ink device for reading and annotation. Slower screen, intentionally. See [[02 DEVELOP/🌱 Seeds/E-Ink and Intentional Computing\|E-Ink and Intentional Computing]].

- **Calendar** — Daily note organization

### Local AI

- **[Ollama](https://ollama.ai/)** — Self-hosted local LLM runner. Runs on the desktop GPU (RTX 4070) so models stay on my hardware.

## 🔐 Privacy & Security

### De-Googling (In Progress)

I'm actively moving away from Google's ecosystem. Progress is real but uneven.

| Service | From | To | Status |
|---------|------|----|--------|
| Storage | Google Drive | Nextcloud / ProtonDrive | 🔄 In Progress |
| Email | Gmail | ProtonMail | ✅ Done |
| Surveillance | Wyze Cloud | Frigate + Home Assistant | ✅ Done |
| Calendar | Google Calendar | [Replacement TBD] | 🔄 In Progress |
| Docs | Google Docs | CryptPad / Nextcloud | 🔄 In Progress |

### Security Essentials

- **[Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/)** — Password management and authenticator.
- **[ProtonVPN](https://protonvpn.com/)** — VPN.
- **Signal** — Encrypted messaging.
- **ProtonMail** — Secure email.

### Privacy Tools

- **uBlock Origin, Privacy Badger** — Browser extensions.
- **DuckDuckGo** — Primary search.

---

## 📚 Reading & Research

- **FreshRSS** (self-hosted) + **Feedflow** — RSS reading and management.
- **Obsidian Web Clipper** — Save and annotate web content directly to the vault.
- **KOReader** — Ebook reading on the Boox.
- **Calibre-Web** (self-hosted) — Personal epub library.
- **Audible / Hoopla / Libby** — Audiobooks.

---

## 🎯 Productivity

- **Tasks**: Testing Obsidian Tasks and Todoist. Not settled.
- **Calendar**: Google Calendar (migration in progress).

## 🔄 Why These Choices?

My tool choices prioritize **open standards**, **data portability**, and **privacy by design**. The core principle is tools that enhance thinking rather than complicate it.

In 2025–2026 that's sharpened into something more specific: sovereignty at a reasonable cost. I'm decoupling my research and personal life from surveillance capitalism, favoring local-first software and self-hosted infrastructure where practical. This isn't purist — I still use tools I'm skeptical of — but the direction of travel matters.

I try to practice what I teach. If I'm asking students to think critically about the platforms and tools shaping their digital lives, I should be doing the same work myself.

Happy to discuss any of these. Reach out if you have questions about implementing similar setups.
