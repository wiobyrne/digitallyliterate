## 📖 Teaching Philosophy

My teaching centers on empowering educators to thoughtfully integrate technology in ways that amplify student voice, promote equity, and develop critical digital literacies. I believe in creating learning environments where students become creators, not just consumers, of digital content while maintaining focus on fundamental literacy skills.
