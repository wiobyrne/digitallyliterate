# Digitally Literate

 🌟 **Welcome!** I'm **Ian O’Byrne** – an educator, researcher, and lifelong learner focused on digital literacy, creativity, and education. While [my main blog lives here](https://wiobyrne.com/), this site is my **digital garden**.

This space evolved from my newsletter into a public notebook where I share and connect ideas in progress. It's less about polished articles and more about cultivating thoughts on topics I care about. 

If you're interested, you can see what I'm up to [[04 META/About Me/Now\|Now]].

## 🧭 Exploring the Garden

Think of this as a network of interconnected notes rather than a linear publication. Here's how you can navigate:

* **Start Here:** Check out these key areas:
    * 📰 [[03 CREATE/📧 Newsletter/📧 Newsletter\|📧 Newsletter]] – Past thoughts and curated resources.
    * 🤖 [[02 DEVELOP/🗂️ MOCs/AI and Machine Learning MOC\|AI and Machine Learning MOC]] - Artificial intelligence and machine learning insights
    * 🔐 [[02 DEVELOP/🗂️ MOCs/Privacy and Security MOC\|Privacy and Security MOC]] - Digital privacy and security resources
    * 🛡️ [[02 DEVELOP/🗂️ MOCs/Digital Resilience MOC\|Digital Resilience MOC]] - Building digital wellness and resilience
    * 🧠 [[02 DEVELOP/🗂️ MOCs/Emotional Intelligence MOC\|Emotional Intelligence MOC]] - Human-centered technology
    * [[01 CONSUME/📚 Books/📚 Books\|📚 Books]] – Highlights from my reading.
    * 🎓 [[03 CREATE/Classes/DL Educator/Digitally Literate Educator\|Digitally Literate Educator]] – Course resources.


## ✨ How This Garden Works

 **Understand the Growth:** Notes mature over time:
- 🌱 **Seeds:** Raw ideas. Initial thoughts and inspirations.
- 🌿 **Plants:** Developing concepts. Developed ideas with context and connections.
- 🌲 **Evergreens:** More refined insights. Polished insights that are fully developed and refined thoughts.

**Discover:** Use search or the graph view to find your own path.

**Follow Connections:** Click on `[[wikilinks]]` within notes to jump between related ideas.

💡 **Start exploring and see where the paths lead you.**
