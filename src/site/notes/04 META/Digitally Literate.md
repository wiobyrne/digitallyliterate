# Digitally Literate

 🌟 **Welcome!** I'm **Ian O’Byrne** – an educator, researcher, and lifelong learner focused on digital literacy, creativity, and education. While [my main blog lives here](https://wiobyrne.com/), this site is my **digital garden**.

This space evolved from my newsletter into a public notebook where I share and connect ideas in progress. It's less about polished articles and more about cultivating thoughts on topics I care about. 

If you're interested, you can see what I'm up to [[04 META/Now\|Now]].

## 🧭 Exploring the Garden

Think of this as a network of interconnected notes rather than a linear publication. Here's how you can navigate:

* **Start Here:** Check out these key areas:
    * 📰 [[02 CURATE/Indexes/Newsletter Index\|Newsletter Index]] – Past thoughts and curated resources.
    * 📝 [[02 CURATE/Indexes/Blog Post Index\|Blog Post Index]] – Longer reflections within the garden.
    * 🤖 [[02 CURATE/Indexes/AI and Machine Learning Index\|AI and Machine Learning Index]] - A simple AI/ML Glossary
    * 📚 [[02 CURATE/Indexes/Book Index Public\|Book Index Public]] – Highlights from my reading.
    * 🎓 [[03 CREATE/Classes/DL Educator/Digitally Literate Educator\|Digitally Literate Educator]] – Course resources.


## ✨ How This Garden Works

 **Understand the Growth:** Notes mature over time:
- 🌱 **Seeds:** Raw ideas. Initial thoughts and inspirations.
- 🌿 **Plants:** Developing concepts. Developed ideas with context and connections.
- 🌲 **Evergreens:** More refined insights. Polished insights that are fully developed and refined thoughts.

**Discover:** Use search or the graph view to find your own path.

**Follow Connections:** Click on `[[wikilinks]]` within notes to jump between related ideas.

💡 **Start exploring and see where the paths lead you.**
