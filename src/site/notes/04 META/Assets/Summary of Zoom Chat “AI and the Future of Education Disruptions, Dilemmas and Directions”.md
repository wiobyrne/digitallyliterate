- Some warned against AI dominance in education; others saw potential to refocus on individual learning paths.
    
- Discussion on whether AI should mediate educational relationships at all.
    

## Human Relationships, Identity, and Cognitive Development

- Emphasis on human connection and student voice development.
    
- Concerns over early AI use stunting identity formation.
    
- Lack of guidelines for age-appropriate AI use.
    
- Risk of losing deep thinking skills; importance of reading and writing.
    

## Professional Development and Institutional Readiness

- Teachers need more support and clear plans.
    
- Examples of educator-created resources were shared.
    

## Assessment, Academic Integrity, and Systemic Change

- Difficulty designing AI-resistant assessments.
    
- Some opt for synoptic/programmatic assessment models.

## Equity, Access, and Open Source

- AI tool costs raise equity concerns.
    
- Suggestions: open source LLMs, local AI deployments.
    
- Potential for AI to assist students with learning needs noted, but fears of commodification persist.
    

## Ethics, Shame, and Systemic Critique

- Shame around AI use is widespread.
    
- Ethical critiques of AI's foundations and industry motivations.
    
- Questioning whether tools or socio-technical systems are the ethical root.
    
- Emphasis on systemic, not just individual, responsibility.
    

## Resistance, Agency, and Alternative Approaches

- Some identify as conscientious objectors to edtech.
    
- Embracing open source/local models as critical alternatives.
    
- Calls for collective, community-based educational innovation.
    

## Indigenous Knowledge and Alternative Perspectives

- Interest in how Indigenous epistemologies might inform AI futures.
    
- Desire to continue exploring these perspectives.
    

## AI Literacy and Critical Thinking

- AI literacy defined as understanding, evaluating, and using AI with societal awareness.
    
- Tension: is AI literacy distinct from general literacy?
    
- Teaching tasks requiring critique and context emphasized.
    

## Policy, Governance, and the Future

- No clear guidelines for AI use in schools.
    
- Interest in ethical statement repositories.
    
- Predictions of AI market instability; implications for academia.
    
- Strong desire for ongoing collaboration and resource-sharing.
    

## Additional Reflections

- ‚ÄúDoers‚Äù and ‚Äúdoubters‚Äù are both essential.
    
- Tech's narrative (e.g., ‚Äúangel on your shoulder‚Äù AI) criticized.
    
- Survey accuracy challenged by shame and bias.
    
- Debate on tool/system entanglement and whether AI models are sustainable.
