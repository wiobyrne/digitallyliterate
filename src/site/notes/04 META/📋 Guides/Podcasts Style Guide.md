# Podcasts Style Guide

## Overview

Podcasts represent **captured episode content with enhanced knowledge development connections** in the vault system. The Podcasts directory prioritizes **systematic YAML standardization and meaningful cross-vault integration** to maximize discoverability and knowledge network growth.

**Philosophy**: Minimal YAML + Knowledge Development + Hard Link Integrity  
**See Also**: [[04 META/üìã Guides/Vault - Directory Style Guide Overview\|Vault - Directory Style Guide Overview]] for system context

## Finalized YAML Template

Podcasts use a **minimal, standardized template** optimized for consistency and knowledge integration:

```yaml
---
title: "Episode Title"
created: YYYY-MM-DD
last_updated: YYYY-MM-DD
status: üåø_plant
tags:
  - podcasts
  - domain-tag-1
  - domain-tag-2
  - expertise-area
author: "[[Host Name]]"
source: "URL or source reference"
connections:
  - "[[Host Name]]"
  - "[[Guest Name]]"
  - "[[Show Name]]"
  - "[[Key Concept 1]]"
  - "[[Key Concept 2]]"
categories: Podcasts
dg-publish: true
shelf: archived
show: "[[Show Name]]"
host: "[[Host Name]]"
guest: ["[[Guest Name]]"]
show_notes_url: "URL"
---
```

## Required Fields (Universal)

### **Essential Fields** (Always Required)
- **title**: Episode title in quotes
- **created**: Episode date or file creation date (YYYY-MM-DD)
- **last_updated**: Last modification date (standardization date)
- **status**: Always `üåø_plant` (string format, not array)
- **author**: Host name linked to People directory
- **source**: Show notes URL or platform reference

### **Organizational Fields** (Required)
- **tags**: Domain-specific tags beyond "podcasts" (3-6 tags)
- **connections**: All related notes as hard links (4-8 links)
- **categories**: Always `Podcasts`
- **dg-publish**: Always `true` for digital garden integration
- **shelf**: Always `archived` for completed episodes

### **Podcast-Specific Fields** (Required)
- **show**: Show name linked to show page
- **host**: Host name linked to People directory
- **guest**: Guest names as array of links (if applicable)
- **show_notes_url**: Original episode URL

## YAML Standards (Critical - Non-Negotiable)

### **Status Format** (Finalized Decision)
- ‚úÖ **CORRECT**: `status: üåø_plant`
- ‚ùå **WRONG**: `status: [üåø_plant]`, `status: "üåø_plant"`, any array format

### **Tag Guidelines** (Minimal Design)
- **Quantity**: 3-6 tags total (including "podcasts")
- **Format**: `lowercase-with-dashes` format only
- **Content**: Domain-specific beyond basic "podcasts"
- **Examples**: `productivity`, `deep-work`, `digital-minimalism`, `creativity`, `leadership`

### **Field Naming** (Standardized)
- ‚úÖ **CORRECT**: `show_notes_url`, `last_updated`
- ‚ùå **WRONG**: `URL`, `show_notes_link`, `updated`

### **People Attribution** (Minimal Approach)
- **Primary**: `author` field for host (links to People directory)
- **Additional**: `host` and `guest` fields for podcast-specific tracking
- **Rationale**: Maintains consistency with vault-wide person attribution system

## Knowledge Development Section (Mandatory)

### **Required Structure**
All podcast notes MUST include the Knowledge Development section with this exact format:

```markdown
## üß† Knowledge Development Connections

[Brief description of episode themes and their relevance to vault knowledge network]

### Related Notes

The themes in this episode connect to several key areas in the vault:

- **[[Host Name]]** - [Host background and expertise area]
- **[[Guest Name]]** - [Guest background and expertise area]
- **[[Show Name]]** - [Show context and typical content]
- **[[Key Concept 1]]** - [How this concept appears in the episode]
- **[[Key Concept 2]]** - [Connection to existing or potential vault content]

### Potential Development Areas

The conversation suggests several concepts worth developing:
- [Specific actionable concept for future Seeds/Plants]
- [Cross-domain connection opportunity]
- [Framework or methodology mentioned]
```

### **Hard Link Requirements** (Critical)
- **ALL** entries in `connections` YAML field MUST appear as `[[links]]` in the note body
- **Verification**: Every connection link must be findable in the Knowledge Development section
- **Purpose**: Ensures Obsidian graph integration and bidirectional linking
- **Quality Check**: Part of standardization validation process

## Content Development Guidelines

### **Minimal Design Principles**
Following the finalized minimal YAML approach:
- **No Complex Fields**: Rejected `connects_to_plants`, `confidence_level`, etc.
- **Essential Only**: Focus on fields that add genuine value
- **Cross-Reference Focus**: Emphasis on meaningful connections over comprehensive metadata
- **Ghost Page Strategy**: Create wikilinks for genuine development opportunities only

### **Domain-Specific Tagging**
Beyond basic "podcasts" tag, include relevant domains:

**Productivity/Habits**: `productivity`, `habits`, `systems`, `time-management`
**Creativity/Content**: `creativity`, `writing`, `blogging`, `storytelling`
**Technology**: `ai`, `digital-literacy`, `tech-ethics`, `cybersecurity`
**Leadership/Business**: `leadership`, `entrepreneurship`, `management`, `culture`
**Philosophy/Psychology**: `philosophy`, `psychology`, `decision-making`, `ethics`
**Personal Development**: `personal-growth`, `self-reflection`, `mindfulness`

### **Ghost Page Development**
Create meaningful wikilinks for concepts that could become future Seeds/Plants:
- **Cross-Episode Themes**: Concepts appearing in multiple episodes
- **Framework Opportunities**: Systematic approaches worth developing
- **Authority Connections**: Expert perspectives worth consolidating
- **Avoid**: One-off mentions or overly specific topics

## Show and People Integration

### **Show Pages** (Linked via `show` field)
- Create or link to show-specific pages for recurring podcasts
- Examples: `[[The Tim Ferriss Show]]`, `[[The Good Fight]]`, `[[Decoder with Nilay Patel]]`
- Show pages track episode collections and provide context

### **People Directory Integration** (via `author` and `guest` fields)
- **Host Attribution**: Always link host via `author` field to People directory
- **Guest Tracking**: Link guests to People directory when applicable
- **Cross-Episode Patterns**: Track expert appearances across different shows
- **Authority Building**: Connect guests to their key concepts and frameworks
