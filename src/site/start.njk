  <p class="landing-subtitle">New to the garden? Here's how to find your way around.</p>
</header>

<h2>How this garden works</h2>

<p>This is a <strong>digital garden</strong> — a working notebook where ideas grow over time. Nothing here is finished. Everything is evolving. Notes move through stages of maturity:</p>

<table>
  <thead><tr><th>Stage</th><th>What it means</th></tr></thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>🌱 Seed</td><td>A raw capture — a quote, a question, a fragment worth keeping</td></tr>
    <tr><td>🌿 Plant</td><td>A developing idea with structure, connections, and open questions</td></tr>
    <tr><td>🌲 Evergreen</td><td>A durable insight — polished, reusable, ready to share</td></tr>
    <tr><td>🪴 Grove</td><td>A curated cluster of related notes — a pathway through a theme</td></tr>
    <tr><td>🌳 Forest</td><td>A big-picture synthesis — what multiple Groves mean together</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Not every idea reaches every stage. That's the point — growth is selective.</p>

<h2>How to navigate</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Follow links.</strong> Notes are densely connected. Click any link to follow a thread.</li>
  <li><strong>Use search.</strong> Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>K</kbd> (or <kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>K</kbd>) to search the entire garden.</li>
  <li><strong>Check the nav.</strong> The top bar links to the main sections: Evergreens, Groves, Books, Newsletter.</li>
  <li><strong>Look at backlinks.</strong> At the bottom of each note, you'll see which other notes link back to it.</li>
</ul>

<p>There's no right way to read a garden. Wander. See what connects.</p>
