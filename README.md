## 🌟 Welcome!

I'm **Ian O’Byrne** – an educator, researcher, and lifelong learner focused on digital literacy, creativity, and education. While [my main blog lives here](https://wiobyrne.com/), this site is my **digital garden**.

This space evolved from my newsletter into a public notebook where I share and connect ideas in progress. It is less about polished articles and more about cultivating thoughts on topics I care about. 

If you're interested, you can see what I'm up to right now at [[Now]].

## ✨ How This Garden Works

Unlike a blog, notes here mature over time. I use a gardening metaphor to indicate the status of a note:

| Stage | Icon | Description |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **Seeds** | 🌱 | **Raw ideas.** Initial thoughts, stubs, and inspirations. |
| **Plants** | 🌿 | **Developing concepts.** Ideas that are growing with context and connections. |
| **Evergreens** | 🌲 | **Refined insights.** Polished thoughts that are fully developed. |

**Follow Connections:** Click on `[[wikilinks]]` within notes to jump between related ideas. 

💡 *Start exploring and see where the paths lead you.*
