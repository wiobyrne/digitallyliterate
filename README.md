# 🌱 Digitally Literate - Digital Garden Vault

Welcome to the public vault for [**Digitally Literate**](https://digitallyliterate.net/), a digital garden curated by **Ian O'Byrne**.

This repository contains notes, blog posts, newsletters, and other writings — a **living archive** that is always growing, evolving, and improving.

---

## ✍️ About This Garden

This is not a traditional blog.

Notes are shared early, updated often, and reflect ongoing thinking. Some are polished essays; others are seeds of ideas being cultivated over time.

**Goals of this garden:**
- 🌐 Share knowledge openly
- 🔗 Connect ideas across disciplines
- 📚 Document learning in public

---

## 📁 Vault Structure

Notes are organized based on purpose:

- `01 Consume/` — Notes on readings, media, and resources.
- `02 Curate/` — Ideas, insights, and connections between concepts.
- `03 Create/` — Original writing, blog posts, and creative projects.
- `04 META/` — Templates, assets, and metadata for vault management.

> ⚡ **Note:** Only notes explicitly marked with `dg-publish: true` are published online.

---

## 🚀 Publishing

Published notes are displayed at [**digitallyliterate.net**](https://digitallyliterate.net/).

This garden is built with:
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) — A powerful knowledge management tool
- [Digital Garden Plugin](https://publish.obsidian.md/Digital+Garden+Plugin/Documentation) — For selective, beautiful publishing

## 🔒 Public vs Private

| Keep Public ✅ | Make Private 🔒 |
| :--- | :--- |
| You want others to explore your notes and ideas | You aren't ready to share everything |
| You're comfortable sharing work-in-progress | You need private backup or draft space |
| You want to serve the vault via GitHub Pages or Netlify | You have sensitive notes or licensing concerns |

---

### 🛠 Recommendation

Since [digitallyliterate.net](https://digitallyliterate.net/) is already public, **keeping this repository public** is recommended.

You control what gets published using the `dg-publish: true` YAML setting — making it easy to garden your ideas selectively.
