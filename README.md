Digitally Literate - Digital Garden Vault ðŸŒ±

Welcome to the public vault for Digitally Literate, a digital garden curated by Ian O'Byrne.
This repository contains notes, blog posts, newsletters, and other writings in progress. It is a living archive â€” constantly growing, evolving, and improving.
About This Garden

This digital garden is not a traditional blog.
Notes are shared early and updated regularly. Some are polished essays; others are seeds of ideas cultivated over time.

My goal is to:

    Share knowledge openly.

    Connect ideas across disciplines.

    Document learning in public.

Vault Structure

The notes are organized by purpose:

    01 Consume/ â€” Notes on what I've read, watched, or listened to.

    02 Curate/ â€” Ideas and connections between concepts.

    03 Create/ â€” Original blog posts, articles, and larger projects.

    04 META/ â€” Templates, assets, and metadata for managing the vault.

Only notes with the correct publish flags (dg-publish: true) are published online.
Publishing

Notes marked for publishing are displayed at digitallyliterate.net.
